1,TurboTax takes the stress out of doing taxes. It takes minimal preparation and walks you through everything step by step. They have done a really great job putting this software package together. I have used TurboTax for the last six years and it gets better every year.
1,Easy to understand and use.  Not as expensive as Turbo Tax.
1,perfect.
1,Functionality is good and the price can't be beat.  There is an extra step when saving to non open office formats but you soon get used to it and after you've created the document it only amounts to an extra mouse click really.
1,"Rosetta stone provides a vast amount of lessons for the user to learn from. It will keep you busy for a long period of time for the price point. While it does have its faults with the voice recognition it doesn't get frustrating to deal with. Very professionally put together and easy for any user to use, whether they have experience with programs like this or not."
0,"I was able to download the Mac version without any trouble. Did not even have to enter the key code which I had heard can be a run around. Have not tried this years version yet, rating based on last years. Always something that drives you batty with these programs, and/or the tax code."
0,"Not enough details, Search functions always returned nothing. crashes several times.Ended up using other software instead. If you have 3G internet access use that instead"
1,works great. easy to use
0,"I had quicken 12 which worked great and was forced to upgrade to this product in April.<br /><br />Last week, I finally converted my 2012 file to this new version. It was a mess! Most of the account settings disappeared. Worse, the converted file disabled most of the menus. In simple terms most of the right click menu's do not show up. I then called the quicken help line and after three hours working with them (including uninstalling the program twice, once with quicken's ultra clean method) we were left with where we started. The lady on the helpline at the end was really honest when she said &#34;I guess Quicken 2015 does not work with Windows 7 and / or Quicken 12&#34;. Even I could not put this more eloquently about how bad this product is!<br /><br />Hope they get a competitor soon so I can get rid of quicken."
0,It does not work if you are working offline.
1,"The new import feature saved me a lot of time. Overall I finished my business taxes in record time with this version.<br />If it was anything else but tax software, I'd say \\""I love it\\""."
1,I have been using Avast for several years and it always arrests Trojans. The Boot-Scan is state of the art for cleaning out infections before the Windows System boots up.<br /><br />The 800 customer service is very user easy to deal with. This is why I recommend it to all my friends.
0,I appreciate the spreadsheets on my accounts.  I am a little disappointed that forms and comparisons available in prior versions are no longer available to me.
0,never git it never worked ???
0,The software didn't have a form I needed and was forced to go to the SC Tax site and retrieve the form and file a paper return. The form dealt with S Corp filing. Other than that I like this software and have used it for several years.
0,"I purchased TT Home and Business and would not let me get passed the SchedC upgrade, even though I had the correct version. Was on the phone for 2 hrs with the support people - nothing helped to push the correct download to me. Will not purchase this program. Somebody made a bad decision as to the upgrade strategy, and keeping tabs of what version does what, and it is backfiring. Bad move.Unhappy customer."
1,"Overall, the suite does the job (as have its predecessors). There are, however, some changes in the context menus in Word that complicate the editing process and apparently cannot be changed by the user. Administrative management will never be a perfect science, but even with its shortcomings this product makes the associated tasks easier."
0,"Not impressed with it, you can do it yourself with an excel spreadsheet"
1,Nice product
0,"think its a great idea with poor software operation, very poor instructions and support. unable to start another song still stuck on the first page won't let me delete or complete the song. Emails to support go unanswered. wasted money!! ..I would suggest going ahead and spend the money on better well known software."
0,Worst Turbo Tax version they could have ever come out with.  I am a CPA and usually this is a breeze and this u ear they have done everything they can to screw this up and charge me more money.  I can't even file right now because they can't take my payment to pay for the efile. I hope someone at Intuit loses their job over this.
0,"A real dud of a video editing suite.  'Videowave' is riddled with problems such as freezing and severe limitations on how small clip sizes can be.  The video software also doesn't recognize certain video formats.  In terms of burning blu-rays or DVDs, only stereo audio is supported and only certain audio formats will be recognized when converting and burning video.  The best program in this software suite is 'photosuite' which is fully functional photo-editing software.  I've upgraded the last two years in hopes that Roxio would address and fix this software's numerous problems but nothing so far.  The only upgrades are relatively useless improvements like 4k support which very few people use at this time anyways.  It's obvious that Roxio doesn't really care about their product and you'll have difficulty getting support.  Even the experts on the Roxio community page suggest switching to Corel's (the new parent company's) other video editing software.  This product is definitely not worth the high price!"
0,"I am a software developer and I made a mistake setting up my opening accounting period. I didn't know this until I spent an hour entering all my company's information, setting up the chart of accounts and employees, customers etc.  And the only solution these SAGE people have: start over. Thats right, these guys have no way to recover from a simple mistake. I have 1 employee!!!! ME.....and these people are so hard up to sell their payroll package that they make sure this function will not work in their product. It is a sad indictment of the software business when this garbage is foisted on users."
1,Quicken is the ONLY accounting software anyone should use
0,"I have used quicken products for at least 10 years. I got the usual 3 year message that you need to update. So I did, for the first time I did it online without buying a disc. I was able to use Quicken 2014 the first day I installed it and have not been able to get it work since then. I can open the program, but as soon as I type in my password it closes automatically. This is driving me crazy. Instead of fighting with it, I'm going to shop around for a new product. Seems like many people are having these same issues, I haven't seen a fix yet. PLEASE RESEARCH FIRST BEFORE BUYING - READ ALL THE REVIEWS."
0,Trying to return this item.  Not user friendly.<br />A new version supposedly just came out to address the issues.<br />This version is not for me.
0,"I refuse to be coerced into buying upgrades I don't need that are just the same thing that I already have, repackaged.  Quickbooks was great 15 years ago when I started using it.  Intuit has since transitioned from a great software company to an extortion racket.  Rather than sell you a product, they feel you are buying a service and should pay for it on an ongoing basis.  I cry foul.  And what's the deal with Intuit's troll trying to assuage the negative comments on Amazon?  I'm done with big brother, it's off to open source land for me."
1,"QuickBooks can be as simple or as complex as you want.  We only use it for tracking financials, bank accounts and trends, but it was easy to generate invoices and accounts receivable and many other features.  A different type of business could run completely from Quickbooks if you wanted."
1,Does a great job.  Makes translation from written to typed text easy.
1,I am happy with the Home and Student Microsoft Office.
1,"Been using it for years with XP - no troubles, no viruses. Still supports XP as of 8/1/2014"
1,This upgrade was very easy to follow and the price was so much cheaper than Microsoft. The only drawback is that there is no CD with this purchase.
1,I was using the Essentials and it is nice to have more of the functionality of the full Quicken.  I used the Windows version for years so it has taken me a while to get used to the more limited Mac edition.  The 2015 version comes very close to the Windows version.
1,Good product.  Had to purchase additional state as income was from more than one state.  That makes it expensive to me.
0,You might think this includes e-filing your state return but it does not. TurboTax will charge you again at the end.
0,Needed a program to track my personal checking account.  Grew up on MS Money and loved it but had a major computer crash.
1,"I've had no problems using this software<br />It works in the background, updates automatically<br />I  would recommend this to everyone"
0,"Very difficult to use. I used it last year, and it seemed easy. This year was very difficult. I would hope next year will be better."
0,"What is the deal with charging much higher prices this year than last ??  The software is almost exactly the same as 2007 -- the costs couldn't justify the price increase \\""just because you could\\"".  Back to the old paper way this year, irs.gov."
1,Good protection.
1,excellent
1,"Great product and user friendly, especially considering it was a free download."
0,"I have had the least productive and most frustrating support encounter of my life.  Quicken mobile simply does not work.  After reporting that balances do not match, I was sent through a litany of repeatedly deleting and re-adding data for one hour and 50 minutes.  Throughout this time, I received excuses from support on unsupported features explalning why i had the problem.  A simple Google search revealed all the excuses and limitations to all be untrue per Intuit.  When challenged with Intuit links,  support withdrew each story one by one and and claimed them to be &#34;miscommunication&#34;. At every turn support refused to escalate the case and was clearly throwing out red herrings hoping I would I give up.  I refused to and at one hour 50 minutes they finally agreed to escalate the case.<br /><br />I did not receive my promised case number via email as promised upon disconnection.  I waited half an hour and initiaited another support call.  They claimed email had been sent half an hour ago.  Email finally arrived at 40 minutes later.  Said email had a case number, but no way to check on status of the incident.  An additional half an hour continued while support argued that there was no such way to check and no date of resolution was promised.<br /><br />So now, the product still does not work and I cannot check on bug status.  The supposed escalation could be completely fictional, or left unworked as low priority and I would have no way to know.  This nonsense has been going on since the 12 releases of Quicken 2014 and was promised to be resolved in 2014.  Don't you believe it!  All the horror stories you read since 2013 are still true for a very significant number of users, and the support group either lies, or is completely unequipped with current information (or both).  Quicken Support's main goal is to try an erase and resync step, and if that is not a solution, get you to give up in frustration and go away so their support stats look ok.<br /><br />Don'tsupport a company that behaves in this manner.  I certainly will not."
1,I have used TurboTax since they bought Parsons Tax Edge and love it.  I use it for my business and personal use and in the past for my mother's returns also.  TT is easy to use and the service from Amazon was also.
1,Outstanding Product!
1,This is the best choice if you use a Macintosh computer. Tried brand x and they have problems running with mac OS9+. They were great however at refunding my purchase cost. Even the sales tax!
1,Have been using this product for several years for personal and a small business. Most painless way to fullful your obligation to the tax man.
0,"Missed some big viruses.  Even after my computer was infected and I ran a scan, it still didn't detect it."
0,"software is downloaded, extracted, and installed, but I can't use it because there's nothing to start it with - no desktop icon to click or anything. it's &#34;...for dummies&#34;, I shouldn't need a computer nerd. I've had this since 8/25. I got passed to the manufacturer, who never got back to me at all. I still cannot use the software I paid $40 for. not impressed"
1,Downloaded it immediately and have used it ever since.  It does exactly what I expected so no surprises here. I just wish it were less expensive.
1,It is really easy to use.
0,"Intuit periodically manipulates Turbotax configuration in ways that raise questions about its integrity.  This year it has eliminated some form access in the Deluxe edition in order to push consumers into higher priced versions that they would not have needed in prior years.  A few years ago, as i highlighted in a widely read review, they did something similar by curtailing the ability of the user to do several returns with the same software purchase.  Resulting criticism and buyer resistance prompted Intuit to reverse themselves.<br />As for me, a longtime user, i am exploring other software solutions.  If i am happy with the conversion capabilities of a competitor, then i plan to switch.  If not, I will hold out and see if Intuit rediscovers its business ethics.<br />Note that negative reviews already outnumber positive ones, and at least one of the five star reviews appears to have been posted on behalf of Intuit."
0,This is a rip-off.  Customer Service for Intuit is a voicemail hell.  No Refunds No Exchanges from Amazon or Intuit.  I thought it was like the older boxed version I owned before that can be used local but it is strictly an online version.
1,"I really love this product! It is compatible with earlier versions of Wordperfect (going back to Wordperfect 8). [[ASIN:B0006PJAZU Corel WordPerfect Suite 8]] [[ASIN:B000HOEDVQ WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows]]  The program is very stable Corel has not added significantly new features since 1999. This makes Wordperfect 17/X7 the ninth &#34;service pack&#34;  of Wordperfect 8 and the eleventh patch since WP 6. Corel has done almost nothing to keep this product up to date with the current needs of offices around the world. Naturally, this means that this is a very stable, well-tested application. This version of Wordperfect allows you to export a file as a PDF document but has no other features for PDF use. It cannot even produce an ebook unless you convert your file to HTML and, from there, convert it to MOBI or epub. I guess you get what you pay for. If you are not very wealthy, you will have to settle for this bare-bones version. I am very glad I bought this.   Other editions of WordPerfect (standard, legal and Professional)have their own problems (or interesting characteristics). WordPerfect's &#34;legal edition&#34; is similar MS Word, legal edition plus the free legal templates from the Microsoft website. Mind you, I really don't like digging through the mountains of templates on the Office website. I like the pleading expert in the Standard and Professional editions of this software. Here are some &#34;free,&#34; &#34;kind of compatible&#34; applications. You get what you pay for.  Openoffice and Libreoffice [[ASIN:B008XAXAC4 Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1 [Open Source Download]]] [[ASIN:B00PT6GQY4 LibreOffice v4.3 for PC [Open Source Download]]]  are both free and yet have more PDF features (import, export) than this edition of WP Office.   Still, I feel strangely attracted to this simple, reliable program. Somehow, it just feels right! The menu system (though ancient-looking  compared Word's ribbon interface) is comfortable and well organized. Much can be accomplished with keybindings and macros written with &#34;PerfectScript.&#34; If you remember the keybindings from the early versions of Wordperfect, you be glad to see that they are still here.  The much hailed &#34;reveal codes&#34; has been superseded by Word's &#34;reveal formatting&#34; feature and is no longer a selling point. Religious arguments aside, Wordperfect relies on the faithfulness of long-time users rather than attracting newcomers who might breathe life into Corel as well as this office suite.  The secondary program in this Suite is the legendary Quattro Pro 17 (also the ninth service pack of Quattro Pro 8, released in 1998). I feel it is a very serviceable, though basic, spreadsheet. Corel inherited the program from Borland and it has never caught the attention and love that Wordperfect has  Another significant element of this office suite is WordPerfect Lightning--essentially a spinoff of Microsoft's OneNote. It is a note-taking and file sorting application that  helps the user organize all of his/her documents and files (adding notes and classifications if desired).  Quattro Pro is a former product of the Borland Company meant to compete with IBM's release of  Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 in 1989. At the time, it was slightly superior to 1-2-3, but with the sale to Corel in 1994, it has remained very stable (as in unchanged and undeveloped) and only gets occasional patches from Corel. It has changed little since the 1990's.  Quattro pro has moderate support for computing linear matrix transformations (i.e. computing a Fourier transform and other linear algebra applications for scientists and engineers)). This is one of the things that Quattro has over Excel. On the other hand, Excel has forged ahead with new features while Corel has maintained the original features of Borland's original Quattro Pro [[ASIN:B000GGVI5O Quattro Pro version 5.0 for Windows 3.1]].  Be careful with this purchase if you depend on Excel compatibility for your employment or work-related applications.  These (version 17) programs have &#34;improved&#34; compatibility with MS Office but are still not perfectly compatible. It helps to be familiar with these programs.  However, being &#34;kind of compatible&#34; with MS Office will not please many employers and could reduce your chances of getting a job where computer skills are required. Do check out LibreOffice and consider it as a helper program for WordPerfect and Quattro. Since Wordperfect does not feature an email or scheduling program, please consider using the free-to-download Mozilla Thunderbird. I know, this is a great handicap but it is fixable and is a fairly decent imitation of Outlook and other PIM applications.  I love this program and probably always will but its relevance as a competitive office product seems to diminish with every new version. WordPerfect 8 was fantastic. This point release is only slightly better after 9 new versions. It should be called &#34;WordPerfect 8.9&#34; because that it is truly the 9th revision of the excellent WordPerfect 8.   Corel needs more users so the program can be improved and developed. I recommend this program to newcomers if only to get some cash flow into Corel so they will continue to make it and support it with updates. Highly recommended. Have fun!"
0,"Purchased this product with E-file but after completing my return, and the recommended software updates, Turbo Tax can't transmit my return. Telling me that it's due to a necessary software update, which has been done, and recommend that I print and file by mail. REALLY??  I paid for e-file to simplify the process. Feeling cheated."
1,"For those that don't know Office 365 is basically a 1 year lease of \\""Office Professional\\"", with some bonuses (80 Skype minutes, an additional 20G of sky drive space, and Office on Demand).  They want people to go to a leased model - and who can blame them. It provides a steady stream of revenue, and they only have to maintain the \\""latest\\"" version.  If everyone is on the latest product, no one has to maintain security updates and patches for software that was released years ago.<br /><br />Also by dangling the \\""5 license carrot\\"" this product becomes very appealing - especially to those of us that want the additional software such as outlook / publisher / one note.  This breaks down to less than $2 per month per computer - Giving \\""Free\\"" a run for it's money.<br /><br />If you are looking for the 'core' office items (Word / Excel / PowerPoint) to use on one or perhaps two PC's - Simply buy Office Home and Student.<br /><br />PRO's of 365:<br /><br />1. Price -  If you are comparing 365 to the Office Professional then spending $100 VS $400 (or even $219 for Office Home/Business) is tempting.  What really adds to the temptation of 365 is that you can install it on 5 machines as opposed to one machine on the other platforms.  So if you need office on your home computer, laptop, and the kids school computer - office 365 may be the route to take; And you would still have 2 licenses left. If you make full use of the 5 licenses you are only paying $1.66 per month per computer.<br /><br />2. FULL office suite.  Your get all 7 software pieces found in Office Pro - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, Access.<br /><br />3. Virtual Office -  If for whatever reason you don't have your computer with you, you can access 'office on demand'.  This will stream a copy of office to any internet connected machine and you can access your files via sky drive.  Nice if you are at someones house / public internet terminal.<br /><br />4. No longer cloud only -  In the past 365 was a cloud only app - the software had limited features and capabilities compared to the full desktop versions, and if you didn't have an Internet connection you didn't have Office.  No more though, you run the real software on your machine locally - so if you are on a plane, or without internet you can still use the product.<br /><br />5. \\""Free\\"" Upgrades - With 365 you are leasing the latest version.  So as long as you maintain your subscription, in a few years when the next version comes out you will be able to upgrade without having to 're-buy' office.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. You are 'locked in' - Every year you must renew your lease if you want continued functionality.  You will still be able to view your documents and notes, but if you don't renew you loose the ability to edit them.<br /><br />2. Tablet support - 365 works well on Win 8 tablets, but no support yet for Android or Apple.<br /><br />3. Price -  There is no price guarantee, what is $100 this year may be $149 next year.  Although I don't see Microsoft pulling any \\""Gotchas!\\"" with this product.  They already know there is some pretty stiff free competition by Google and Open Office. I think the $100 price point is here for at least 2 years perhaps 3, then we will see a sales pitch to \\""renew early and avoid the price increase to 119\\"".<br /><br />------Bottom line:<br /><br />The bottom line is this, Office 365 is a good product that runs quite smooth, 365 is now a solid product.

1,very pleased with product.
1,"You have made it easier to keep track of where the dollars go. How many have wondered \\""Where did my money go?\\"" With Quicken you have the answers, and with a few clicks can see exactly where and plug those holes so you can start proper savings, never forgetting about a bill, and keeping your credit score above 800. With my scanner I can toss all those bills into a box without worrying if I will need anything at tax time. If I need it, I know exactly where to find it in seconds."
1,"I am moving from a PC to a Mac, so I have my information converted, and it seems to have done it properly. There are quite a few things different about the Mac version from the version I was using on my PC, things that make using it more cumbersome, but I am learning as I go and still plan to keep on using Quicken for my bookkeeping."
0,"I have used Quicken since 1994, I have updated versions about every other year.  It seems to get less useful with each release.  The automatic updates linked to your bank account are incomplete and never match the balances in the account.  If you want to use this for some reason, forget about the automatic updates and enter the stuff manually, It is your only hope, but it means you have to reconcile your account manually with the bank statement.  Easy or correct is your choice with this software.  The customer support is appalling.  I am not sure what a good alternative is to this product or I would use it.  I use turbo tax and think it is great, but they have ruined a good product in Quicken with a bunch of features that are unnecessary needed and do not work properly."
1,Useful!
1,Amazing program! I picked mine up for only $30 (not sure what it is now). I have started drawing manga and anime with it using a Wacom tablet. All of the tools work great and comparative to Photoshop I think that Clip Studio is a far better drawing program. If you have any interest in digital drawing you should definitely get this! And don't forget about getting a Wacom tablet!
1,great product
1,This is the first time I have done my taxes myself. Turbo Tax was easy to download straight from Amazon and very simple to use. They walked me through everything I needed to check and then e-filed it all for me. Also it saved me information so that next year things should be even easier. Highly recommended.
1,"I boarded the TurboTax train a few years ago after a bad experience with a bad accountant. Plus, I really don't need special accounting expertise for my filing.<br /><br />I keep reusing TurboTax every year because it carries over the information from the previous year's filing (if, of course, you used TurboTax the prior year), including: W-2 information, refund amounts, list of organizations you donated to, etc. Because of the information carry over, it makes my filing process very fast.<br /><br />As advertised, TurboTax does walk you through the many components of filing (eg. property deductions, education deductions, etc) -- so you can decide which things are applicable for you.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product. There are probably comparable ones out there, but it would be time and ease prohibitive for me to switch over at this point."
1,"I have had no problems with my computer since using Avast. Quick,sharp, easy to use and it gets the job done."
1,Great Program.  Works like I wanted.
1,I have used Movavi products for several years and have found the software to be stable and does the job fast and error free. Highly recommended.
1,"This makes doing your taxes so easy! There were a few questions that were a little hard to understand, but once you figure that part out, which was not that bad, it's a breeze!"
0,"Greetings, last minute tax filers. I have bad news. If you're banking on this software to handle your semi-complicated state filing situation, you may need to look elsewhere. I ended up filing my state returns on paper. Here's my story.<br /><br />I worked consecutive jobs in Virginia, then Maryland last year. I also moved from Virginia to Maryland last year (funny how that works). I knew this would be a little complicated, so I decided to buy the software. I've used the H&R Block online federal service for years, and never had any problems. After downloading Maryland and going through the questionnaire process to build my return, the software said I owed taxes, interest, and penalties to Maryland for the time I lived in Virginia and worked in Maryland. This is not the case, as Maryland and Virginia have a reciprocity agreement so that wage earners do not have to pay taxes to two states on the same earnings. I tried everything I could, but I could not get the software into a situation where I answered all the questions it asked correctly and it didn't calculate the unpaid taxes and penalty. In short, it did not recognize the reciprocity agreement between Maryland and Virginia. That was annoying.<br /><br />I called the H&R Block customer assistance number. Surely I was doing something wrong and someone could show me which box I neglected to click. But that 's not what happened. The man who answered, though polite enough, seemed to be limited to asking me to uninstall and reinstall the software. That was also annoying, more so because I had to hold for half an hour before I got to this non-solution. When I tried again to explain the situation to him, he told me he couldn't help with my tax question (only the software) and then referred me to a live chat service that he said could help me. After queuing in the chat room for another half hour, I was connected and explained my problem. I was immediately told that this was not the chat room I was looking for. It was thatother chat room that had the tax people in it.<br /><br />At that point I'd had it and signed off. I'd already wasted over an hour waiting and explaining my problem with nothing to show for it. I ended up filling out my state returns on paper and filing them (quite a few more hours work). Keep in mind--this was not a complicated filing other than the multiple states/residencies. I can't say I'll go this route again. Also, this was not on tax-eve. It was a few weeks before. I can only imagine the wait times will be much worse for anyone having issues on tax day."
1,I love Office in general.  Wish there were more templates under Business type documents Publisher. I see small business as the group buying Publisher version so should be strongest in business templates.
0,"Product is Ok and does most of what i needed and expected however compared with many software products on the market today its interface is not very intuitive.  I would actually go as far as saying the 'dual' presentation of graphical and traditional menu based interfaces actually makes the product harder to use.  There is a significant amount of functionality/features you can not get to via the graphical presentation, forcing users to jump between interface styles (Menu/Graphical).<br />From a functionality perspective the only gripe is around sales/use tax. - I was expecting built-in / pre-defined tax tables that could either be automatically updated or easily managed, sadly neither is the case.<br />On the Use Tax side I can not find any functionality that helps track/record use tax liability against purchases. - Being honest this Use Tax 'gap' may be due to me not knowing the product well enough but if such functionality does exist, I cant find it."
0,It worked for what I needed to do with it.  It was really buggy though and would stop working.
1,My son told me about this antivirus and It is easy to use and so far I have had no problems with my computer. .
0,i think that it is total nonsense that you have to pay to fill out a state return and then you have to pay again to e-file. all the box says is that it includes state. this seems to be an intentional bait ans switch.
1,"A good product that makes sense and is easy to use.  Prior to this product I was a MS Money user for 5+ years.  A couple of years ago we discovered Financial Peace University and budgeting, so I started doing the excel spreadsheet thing in order to figure out my budget.  This year I broke down and decided it was time to upgrade my PC to an Apple, so I was looking for an Apple budgeting product when I stumbled across YNAB.  It has been a lucky find on my part and I'm very glad that I found it.  The free online seminars are very helpful and the instructor takes the time to answer questions (all for free).  Its great to see a product that the company stands behind (not to mention their story is a great one as well).  Thank you YNAB."
1,I have used Word Perfect for many years and X7 is as good as they get.
1,"Very kid friendly, my son did no even consider he was LEARNING. I recommend this program for reluctant young learners."
0,"This product wouldn't sync to my bank. I had to call my bank for help. In order for me to get this to work, I had to sign into my bank and sync directly from the website. This saved me no time for me in my opinion. I really believe this could be a useful tool to someone if it worked the way it says. I appreciate both Amazon and Quicken for refunding me my money when I expressed my disappointment."
0,"Upgraded from 2012 to 2015.  The program works, but it destroys my computer start-up.  Using Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit.  Several start-up items don't load until a key is depressed (logitech keyboard & mouse) and Google Drive and Tresorit never show up in the tray unless I manually run them.  I tried this twice, and have restored to 2012.  Hopefully they will fix this or I wasted $30.    Update:  I increased to 3 stars because after Quicken chat help (yes, they do exist) I was able to get it installed without crashing my other apps.  Had to stop all except Microsoft applications, reboot and reinstall.  So far all is working well, but it was an ordeal to do."
1,"I've been using Quicken since the 2001 version on an old Windows ME computer.  The printer that was compatible with that computer died about a week ago.  I tried every way in the world to xfer the Quicken 2001 to a Windows 7 computer, but no go.  I was afraid all my files for the last tax year (2009) were history.    I searched the web and the best price for Quicken 2010 was at Amazon.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try and I would deal with any download or install problems when I got to them.    It took less than 5 min to download, another 5 min to install and another 5 min to xfer my old files to the 2010 version.  Then, I went in to do my thing for 2009 taxes and that took another 5 min and about 2 min to print out.  I'm now ready for when the taxman cometh!  LOL    The entire purchase/download/install/restore files was flawless.  There are a few more bells and whistles than on the 2001 version, but nothing super hard."
0,Thank you all for the warning.  I was about to order Turbo Tax Deluxe as usual to start my returns and noticed the low ratings.  Off to try H&R Block...
0,"I bought this to compare with the 2012 h&r tax software, after purchase and download I realize that it is for 2011.  I don't know how many people need the previous year, but for me, this was a waste of my time and penny."
0,"Just bought this on Amazon and the key would not work when Amazon displayed the  key submission box. Would also not work on Norton's site. Tried typing and pasting in the key, but it didn't work. Maybe it's a website problem. Spoke in chat with someone at Norton who confirmed my key was valid, and wanted to do a remote session, which I guess I'll have to do as I can't get a refund. This product has good reviews, but you might want to buy it directly from Norton."
0,"Adding my voice to the chorus.  Been using TurboTax almost since I started filing taxes: buying TurboTax has become a February ritual.  Apparently Intuit thinks there aren't good competing products out there.  I've done the research.  There are.  Sorry I have to go, but I'll bit the bullet this year and switch to something else.  Also will start looking into alternatives to Quicken, since Intuit seems to want to cash out on their customers' loyalty."
0,"This version SUCKS.  The worst QB version yet.  It is slow, it is cumbersome and it does not learn.  The new &#34;My Shortcuts&#34; is stupid.  It used to open up to where you left off.  Now you have to clear out multiple windows to get to what you want.  It's a constant fight.  2 months later and none of us are happy (3-user version plus 1 solo version purchased.).<br /><br />Again, RUN, do not walk away from this one and hope that Inuit gets their heads on straight for the next version."
1,The progrma is what I wanted.  My hard drive crashed and I was allowed to download it again.
0,"Worst hundred plus bucks I ever wasted.  I'm not a accountant, but I have done business bookkeeping for more than 20 years and I have a fair knowledge of accounting practices. I had the impression (was it from the advertising?) that TurboTax Business  would import data from QuickBooks seamlessly.  It did import from QuickBooks but not in a form that fit my S Corporation tax return.  For example, the terms in the Balance Sheet produced by QuickBooks are completely different from those on the Form 1120S Balance Sheet.  Even the CPA to whom I ended up sending my tax return was puzzled by it.<br /><br />Editing was difficult and non-intuitive.  To edit a single item required starting at the beginning and moving through items until one came to the one to be edited.  I finally found that some entries in the forms could be overridden, but that feature was not described anywhere.<br /><br />TurboTax Business should not be purchased by anyone who does not have an extensive accounting background."
1,"It is a good product for its primary purpose, BUT I am tired of all the bulls**t update messages.  ...and your update process is evasive, confusing, and does not dependably function.  It is worth the price."
1,"I draw as a hobby, and I'm always looking for good digital drawing programs.  I use Gimp and PDN, and they're good, but I was looking for something with a little more firepower, especially in areas of design.  I bought this on a whim when it was on sale, and I couldn't be happier with it!  It's chock full o' great features.  Some of my favorites are the perspective guides and rulers.  There are also a ton of brushes that come equipped, which is fantastic!  If you're new to digital painting/drawing, or are looking for something that can either mimic a pencil on paper feel, or provide great design, inking, and coloring options, I'd highly recommend Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7."
1,"purchased the 2013 Deluxe software for my new laptop with Windows8.  Works great, integrates with my financial institutions, downloads credit card transactions etc, although this is optional if you don't want to use that feature.  Reports are helpful and give a nice snapshot of where money is being spent so you can easily see where cutting back will work.  The software notifies you of upgrades and keeps things running smoothly.  Easy to backup and maintain.  Good purchase."

0,"Why is it so hard to just watch movies on the computer?  I have yet to find good, reliable software.  This one is no better.  Spin the wheel and try a different one.<br /><br />It works, most of the time, eventually, but the process of getting it started is dicey.  It likes to freeze up without explanation.  Sometimes it will say it can't read the disk and the solution is to just try it again.  I'm sure they are having to work with limits imposed by the movie industry but there's no excuse for software that freezes and offers the user nothing but a spinning Windows icon as explanation.<br /><br />Incidentally, I find pausing is dicey too.  It seems to take several seconds for the sound to turn back on, so any pause requires me to restart the video a little ways behind where I was so that the sound can catch up by the time I'm back to the point where I paused it..."

0,Banking direct link does not work efficiently if at all. They had me on phone today for an hour and ten minutes running through trouble shooting this issue. I have been paying for product which primary time saving function (eg direct bank download) does not work for 4 months now..... despite the fact they list working with  my credit union which is why I bought the product in the first place. Uploading a spreadsheet weekly or even daily as would be necessary is a not a time savings ...its TIME WASTING!<br /><br />I suspect that they work well with big banks but BUYER BEWARE IF YOU WORK WITH MID SIZE TO SMALLER BANK!
1,"To this point I have been satisfied by the protection and performance. But, I am still not sure what the difference between this product and Norton 360 is."

0,"If you have been using Excel for a while (at least 10 years), you would know not much has changed or improved.<br /><br />Sure there has been some incremental improvements. But the Excel 2013 has about as much functionality as Excel 2000.<br /><br />What is missing the most? In my opinion, Excel is distinctly lacking in statistical and regression tools. Yes, Excel has statspack, but it is a poor-man's tools for statistics and not the most useful one at that.<br /><br />In my view, Excel should be competing directly against SAS, R, and MATLAB in statistical prowess and functionality. Instead, it remains (for a long time) a spreadsheet with bare bones statistical ability.<br /><br />Excel 2013 is what consumers gets when there is a monopoly and there is no serious competition to push the limits of what a spreadsheet can do. A spreadsheet should be the ultimate statistical analytics tool, which Excel 2013 is not.<br /><br />This is really too bad because there is a need in the market that can combine the usefulness of a spreadsheet with the power of statistical tools such as R and SAS. Yes, there are some aftermarket add-in software for Excel that tries to fill this need. But that is both an expensive, and in my opinion, should be an unnecessary add-on.<br /><br />To me, the most useful recent innovation in Excel is the one that isn't always used. It is the Excel Solver. It is an optimization tool based on provided assumptions. It is priceless in determining optimal number, logistics, and best decisions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Still useful as a spreadsheet.<br />2)Adds some powerful graphical features (but still not as good as professional graphics tools).<br />3)Excel Solver, which is often unused, is a highly useful for making decisions on logistics.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)Only has basic statistical modelng functionality. Statspack, which is the Excel's main regression tool, is a disgrace and inferior to free and open source tools such as R."
1,I have not used the payroll basic...but we do use the main Quick Books Pro.  Very secure system.  It has so many features that it is somewhat a bit difficult for people who are not computer savvy.  Strongly recommend training before just jumping in.
1,"This program is well-made and probably quite effective.  The teacher is clear, the movements are challenging but do-able, and doing it will certainly get you in shape.  I wanted to clarify, though, that if you are looking for a &#34;peak fitness&#34; program, this is a different definition of the term.  It's not the 20-minute workout with 30-second blasts of cardio followed by lower intensity recovery periods outlined on sites like Mercola.com.  This is an hour-long aerobics program that builds in intensity over the course of the hour, with about six minutes of cool-down.  It's very well-designed, if you're up for this level of challenge.  This is what comes up first on Amazon when doing a &#34;peak fitness&#34; search, but it's not using the term &#34;interval training&#34; in the same sense."
1,"Finally took the leap and bought word haha, its been a long time since I've used it but with this product I get new versions of everything! Defiantly worth the money, just be aware that the download does work (it just takes a while and tells you it wont at first haha very scary) and that Microsoft support refuses to acknowledge the existence of a download version or they just have never been trained on it (to them nothing exists without a product key). This does not need a product key only for you to log in or create an MS account; this account is automatically linked to the purchase so it will download and install on its own eventually."

0,"I was forced to buy Quicken 2013 because they would no longer allow my Quicken 2010 to download from my bank.  This program is not nearly as good as 2010 as others have observed but it is the only game in town.  Started out with problems in forcing registration.  Had to call Intuit India to get help to get rid of the registration screen.  The changes are more designed to help Intuit sell more loans and other things than to provide a quality program.  This thing is not as good as 2010 and it was not as good as Quicken 2008.  If they think they are being intuitive in data entry and handling, they must be on another planet.  This is really bad but.... until something else comes along it is the only game in town."
0,"First it removes previous product.  Then it installs.  Then the computer has to restart, and that is where my problem occurs.  It takes a minute to reconnect to the internet on my wireless connection, and by that time it is too late!  The installation aborts.  I have tried several times and have STILL not succeeded.<br />I really should have gotten the disc rather than the download."
1,I have been wanted to make the switch to Open Office for awhile.  So far I like it.  Wish they would add an email program like Thunderbird.
1,Love the program just like I have enjoyed the many past years that I have used the deluxe version.  I used to have rental property and during that time I used that type of version.  Intuit keep up the great work.
1,"Like many recent reviews, I purchased this code because it was on sale.  Apparently there have been problems downloading the map but I was able to do so as of 5/2/10 5P EST.  In addition, I wanted to mention that this works on the c320.  It's not officially listed but the c320 is pretty much the same as the c330, which is compatible.  This was a sorely needed update for me and a great buy.  Thanks!"

0,"Every year I get the new Quicken as soon as I am notified, and every year at least one of my banks is not on board.  I cannot download information from BB&T, and they will not offer service for Quicken 2014 until later in November.  I would think that would all be negotiated, and you would think I would learn, but sometimes I forget.  So I remain in limbo and try to manually download my transactions, waiting patiently.  Other than that coordination piece, I am pleased with the product and continue to order it TOO EARLY every year."
0,"So glad I peeked inside before buying this year's Deluxe version. Funny, I'm a retired CPA and former QuickBooks Pro Advisor. The same disappearing functions happened in QuickBooks and Quicken too. The next Quicken upgrade I buy looks like it will cost about $100. The last one (2012) was $35 including tax. Ouch.<br /><br />As a CPA with some actual tax preparation experience, I was starting to have some trouble with the Turbo Tax interface, forcing me into ways of doing things that weren't always quite what I would have wanted or expected. For me, I think it's probably best that Intuit forced the issue for me to move on.<br /><br />Good-bye Bob. Hello H&R Tax Software."
1,I have used TurboTax for years.  It is easy to use but sometimes the help section could use more information.
1,"Free, works good enough not to pay yearly for Microsoft word.<br />Downloading from Amazon made me feel safe that I was not downing loading from a fake site."
0,"I was very excited to see the Quicken Cloud.  I assumed such a major change would have been heavily tested and ready to go.  Unfortunately it is not.  I started having transactions being deleted from the start of using this product.  I now have no confidence in my account balances.  This is very bad.  On the positive side, this is one of the best feature updates they've had in a while so worth the update once they work out the bugs and data corruption.<br /><br />The mobile cloud sync is a nice feature but once again Quicken is having a hard time developing a modern product.  For example, syncing does not seem to happen automatically and there are no apparent notifications that a sync is needed.  Also, a popup progress box pops up during syncing so you end up just watching a progress bar for a minute or more.  It seems a little half-baked because of that.<br /><br />The mobile application has a lot of promise.  But it too behaves like an application in early development.  You can only access checking, savings, and credit card accounts.  No investment accounts.  Also, you can't do much more than look at balances and enter transactions.  I hope Intuit will be upgrading this application in the future.<br /><br />I think I've basically paid to be a beta tester at this point.  Sorry to be so blunt Intuit but you can do better.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The fix came out 10/9/12 but the instructions to update using One Step Update did not work.  Also the fix instructions say to delete my Cloud ID and reconvert from the previous version (deleting all the transactions I've done since the upgrade).  Not cool.  I recommend sitting this one out until things settle down.  At this point I'm not even confident the fix will work.  In fact Quicken states that if the problem still occurs, you can sign up to be notified on the next fix.  Really?  They're not even sure the fix will work???  Finally I did contact support through chat.  The person I spoke with used broken English and did not offer any partial refund or retribution for my time.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 11/2, I'm still not using cloud sync because I don't trust it.  I'm getting duplicate transactions for some of my transaction downloads for my bank.  Also, some of my transactions at a mutual fund company are not downloading.  So it still seems there are issues with this version.  It is difficult to find help with this on their support web site.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 1/5/13, there have been 10 update revisions.  Yes, that's 10 in 3 months.  I'm glad they are continuing to work on this but 10 updates and I'm still getting duplicate transactions!  However, for the most part, it appears to be functioning enough to continue using.  Intuit can't be happy with the fact that long time users like myself now hate their product.  I can't express how disappointed I am in this product.  Not once have I gotten an email from Intuit expressing acknowledgement of this very bad annual release.  I'm still avoiding the cloud sync until Intuit can give me an assurance that it is working without data corruption.  Help us out Intuit...start a conversation to get us to have confidence in your product again.ot offer any partial refund or retribution for my time.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 11/2, I'm still not using cloud sync because I don't trust it.

1,"For the most part TurboTax is an easy to use program.  However, each year there are statements or processes that are confusing and requires one to go to the forum to find answers.  As an example there were many questions on the forum as how to bypass the deductions portion and immediately take the standard deduction.  This is something so simple that it should have been obvious in the program but it wasn't.<br /><br />Also for those taking the standard deduction this simplifies the entire process of filing a tax return and therefore one should not have to spend the $59 to just do this simple task.  Otherwise a good program for doing one's taxes."
0,"you should see the site... hundreds of reviews... all four and five stars... and they made up every single one except for a few...  many of their made up reviews were from amazon... interesting... there were no links to a single one... but they sure felt free to use the name...  also had many statements and awards from sites you never heard of... and eleven pages of trade magazine reviews which is only their self promotion...  how about this a review from MrYouHelp... from YouTube, everyone's heard of him...  might be worth using the free trial and throwing it in the trash...  i don't know why i gave it a two..."

1,Great software
1,"I had Quicken about 12 years ago.  I loved it then.  I have a new computer so I needed to put the updated Quicken 2015 on my computer.  It is a great tool to have to organize your finances, balance your checkbook and to see how you are utilizing your money.  It helps you watch your spending and see what areas you can cut down on.  I would strongly recommend getting Quickens for Dummies book as it does take quite a while to figure out how to set it all up. It will walk you through it in a more logical manner like: how to download the banking statement, how to split the transactions, how to move it from one category to another, to reconcile your transactions and, to set up the Budget spreadsheet.  The book will help you understand the sequence of \\""how to set up your account\\"".<br /><br />BUT, once you get the knowledge down pat, it is great once you start putting in the financial data.  It really helps visually to see where your money is going and areas to watch your spending.  I have not done the tax section yet as I am figuring that part out.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a more organized budget and see all your financial accounts. It will help you stay on top of your bills and spending.  :-)"

Refund had to be applied for AFTER taxes filed - which I did on 4/13...so on 4/22 I attempt to apply for the refund but the site isn't there anymore...BUT in SMALL Print it said the offer expired 4/20.  Customer service was NOT helpful.  (Polite but NOT ABLE to satisfy the customer.)<br />I have been a TTax user for almost 20 years - but if they continue to refuse to do the right thing... I will NEVER purchase this product again!<br />Sincerely disappointed!<br />Thank you TTax for NOTHING!  (re: Expired Refund for Deluxe version)
0,"I have been using Quicken for quite a few years and have always thought it was an excellent product until Quicken Deluxe 2013 came out. They made a change in that version and carried it over into version 2014 that is EXTREMELY IRRITATING and that was -- They've taken the ability to view Loans in \\""Two Line Format\\"". I don't know who the Rocket Scientist was that made that decision but THEY ARE AN IDIOT. That decision should have been left up to the user. They have no idea how program user use the program so removing features to protect me from some supposed problem is acting like the Government we now have that thinks they are obligated to \\""Protect me from Myself\\"" even if I don't want them in my life."

0,"Ive been an avid Quicken user since like 2005 and an avid mac user since Quicken 2007, just leaving Quicken Essentials to move to Quicken 2015 for an upgrade,. What Ive come to find out is that thesis not an upgrade, it's an unfinished product that has downgraded my ability to do what Quicken is supposed to do, track my finances.<br /><br />As a basic user, simplicity and accuracy matters and while Quicken Essentials wasn't terrific, Quicken 2015 has done terrible matching transaction causing double and triple work ensuring balances lines up and transactions are correct. The registers are difficult to read and the side bar is cluttered and not customizable. At the core the basics are bad, and considering users like myself waited all this time to get an update for this application, this is like a slap in the face.<br /><br />THE WORST PART IS I CANT EVEN RETURN THIS PIECE OF JUNK BECAUSE OF AMAZON'S SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD POLICY! I would be more than happy to return it and go back to essentials, at least that matched my transactions correctly."
0,"This is my first ever 1 star review on Amazon after 13 years of great experiences.  I thought I had all my bases covered following the TurboTax debacle.<br /><br />Like many other disgruntled TT users, I wanted to give the guys at H&R Block a shot because I was under the impression from the reviews over there H&R could handle everything TurboTax can at a lower price.  The price is nice, everything implies this includes State, what's not to love?  Hidden inside the fine print, though, they write that they want an extra $20 to actually submit the State e-file.  They apparently include all the relevant forms you need, but they won't actually submit your work until you pay them a second time.  So this program really costs over $50.  That's pretty lousy, H&R.<br /><br />This may also be the last time I buy a PC Download version of a program through Amazon because there is no return option.  You actually forfeit the right to return when you buy a download vs buying a disc.  I'm stuck with it despite the fact that it hasn't even been used yet.<br /><br />Really glad this is the exception and not the norm around Amazon.  I figure the best I can do is warn others not to make the mistake I did."

0,When we did the CA state taxes  -  there was a glitch that wouldn't let us complete and send it.
1,Love avast. Didn't recieve 5 stars because of slower start up times. Have used avast for a couple of years and have had no problems.
0,Lots of problems last year with this product! State tax return took forever! customer service was horrible! I have been using Turbotax for over 10 years and have never had a problem. But after last year I don't know if I can use this product again it was that bad! And to top it off it was their fault. Their customer service knew nothing about it yet on the state of Minnesota website there was a notice that the state was notified by Turbotax/Intuit that they had a software issue? Also the state of Minnesota was advising taxpayers not to use this product. I didn't get any response from Turbotax until I started bad mouthing them on Twitter. So be warned!
0,Works pretty well and is user friendly. Not happy that the Amazon description lists e-file as a feature then when you get through the program TurboTax wants to charge another $18 x 2 for e-filing state and federal. By the time I added it up I  could have seen a tax professional for a few bucks more. Feel like I got screwed on the price.
1,I use it every year ...<br /><br />same ol' same ol'.
0,"Quicken 2015 for Mac is a disaster. Compared to Quicken 2007, every transaction now takes multiple steps. The software is very user-unfriendly and one of my investment accounts was completely screwed up after the data conversion. Fortunately, I was able to go back to Quicken 2007. Unfortunately, I did not buy the software from Amazon but downloaded it directly from the Quicken website. Now I am out of $68.89 for a useless piece of coding (actually wanted to use another word...)."
1,My husband used it but said he didnt have any problems
1,I use some not so secure site's. Avast keeps me from getting into trouble. I am new to computers so I need all the help I can get
1,It was delivered wirelessly and quickly.  Installed it and it works flawlessly.  It was a great price for what I needed.
1,very good to work in but at first difficult to find the product key -- it was not prominently displayed either thru a link or in instructions.
0,kept reverting program back to 7  day trial version will contact and see if they can correct this issue if they do then star status will be updated
1,"I found Turbotax to be a great way to do my taxes. It was a very easy format to follow throughout the process. The software did the work, and all I had to do was insert the required data. For a few extra bucks it took care of my State taxes in addition to my Federal taxes.  I highly recommend Turbotax to those who want a professional  product."
1,I have been using Intuit Quickbooks for about two years. I have yet to find another program that is expandable to your busines nees
0,"Every time I attempted to download this, it downloaded the 2010 version and my product key would not work."
1,The best free antivirus in my opinion never had a virus to date
0,"not up to date, uses old 2012 mileage and it cannot be updated... they say next software update time frame is not yet announced... doesn't work right with windows 8.  Terrible, only thing that went well was the smoothness of return which was surprising since I bought it through amazon and not from intuit directly.  Their customer service was helpful and nice so they get at least one star. They must get a lot of returns from the amazon sales since they specifically explain who to email for those types of returns.  good luck!"
1,"I use Quicken for all my personal checking accounting, 401K management, debt reduction goals, online billpay, and our business account management.  Above all, I can replicate all this to the secure cloud services for access via my mobile devices.  The best money management tool out there!"
0,"Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.<br /><br />Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview<br /><br />I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.<br /><br />In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.<br /><br />Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.<br /><br />The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance."
1,"Payroll is a breeze with QuickBooks. It is fast, easy and painfree. I've never had a problem. Everything is easy to track; everything is at your fingertips."
0,I spent over $400 on this program because it was advertised to have enhanced workflows built in through form creation and distribution.  Form Central is being discontinued in mid 2015.  I have tried unsuccessfully to obtain a refund.  I'm very disappointed.
1,"So, far, working as expected/advertised (as far as I can tell...)"
1,I think Quicken is the best product out there for handling financial concerns. I have been using Quicken since the days of DOS.
1,amazing purchase. i was able to download and key worked file.<br /><br />make sure in ID put the ID numbers / characters<br />  in key put the key numbers and you are set.<br /><br />make sure u dont copy paste might not work instantly. dont give up and try it works.<br /><br />this product made my PC fast by removing nasty malwares and PUP . Highly recommended to anyone who is serious in protecting their systems.
0,Simply dreadful. Intuit treats its Mac customers with utter contempt. I'm in the arduous process of switching to iBank after I've forgotten how long with Quicken.
0,"I pretty much hate it.<br />It will only sync 80% of my accounts.  While that is a majority, the whole point is to be automated."
1,Good
1,"I am very new to the wonderful world of photography.  I have the &#34;original&#34; canon rebel (300D) camera and am slowly navigating through what it can and can't do.  I downloaded the Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and realized that the idiot behind the camera lens can be greatly helped with this product.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in getting massive amounts of help creating, cleaning up and having fun with photography.  I spend so much time on my computer playing with my photographs and just enjoy being able to get lost in reliving the days!"
1,Been waiting for this for seven years!
0,I have no complicated tax issues so this product was fine. What I DID NOT LIKE was how sneaky it is about state e-file. It's an additional $19.99 it is not free. That needs to be made explicitly clear on the item details and it is NOT.
1,dose the job exentaly !
1,"Did what was expected, as expected, and less expensively than TurboTax. Will consider again next year at &#34;tax time&#34;"
1,This is the only brand I use or install on other computers.  Works well and cannot beat the one time fee.. although I understand that this offer will soon not be available. :(
0,"Well! i got it download thru Amazon link but could not install it, so thanks me for being a bit computer whiz and was able to re download it thru free software site and went from there and just applied the the key.Still a very good savings."
1,This antivirus software came personally recommended by &#34;Dr Dave&#34; Mason of computer talk radio fame.  It has been VERY reliable so is definitely a keeper! .
0,"I'm having lots of trouble trying to convert Quicken 2002 history over to ver 2014. If there was an easy way to do this, I would love to use ver 2014."
1,"The product works great and the support by Norton, when I experienced an issue was wonderful.  I like this product and the password vault/safe that allows me to have one app that works on my desktop, laptop and mobile devices, keeping all passwords in sync and available."
1,this site is quite good computer running better the only thing i had to do is uninstalled protection as it would not let a game site through would  be nice to have protection aswell and to be asked if i want to allow sites
1,I chose this product to download because I have an old computer where the CD drive doesn't work.  Needed to download.
1,There was a time I wouldn't touch a Norton product.  A few years back they totally reworked their program and since then it it isn't the resource hog it used to be.  It runs silently in the background and yet appears to keep you safe.  I have had any real virus issuers since I moved back to them.  It's not so hyper active that it keeps you from doing what you want to do. I had one program I tried that was so aggressive it would even let me download Apple I-tunes software without going totally spastic.  Amazon delivers this product for a price that is by far the cheapest on the net as near as I can tell.  I believe it's about 50% of Norton's price on the web.
1,I wish I didn't have to keep updating.  I don't need the bells and whistles.
1,"I started using Microsoft Money years ago, but when they quit having the ability to download from my bank, I switched to Quicken.. Love, love, love this app! By categorizing all expenses and income, I am able to track everything. And now that a new year has started, I've already done my taxes! Just waiting for W2's, etc. best thing since sliced bread! Thank you!"
1,Computer still clean (as far as I now)..
0,"As always, Microsoft makes the products that most of us use on a regular basis.  This is not different as it gives you exactly what you want and need. We are currently transitioning to Google Apps for Business but there are still some small parts of our business that we cannot completely move from Office products.  For that, it fits the bill. Otherwise I recommend the Google Apps much more than the bloated office suite."
1,Great program. It really protects my computer and I feel safe using it.
1,"Highly recommended. Easy to use. Fast refund. All you have to do is insert the disk, follow the instructions and fill in the information. It's that simple. No matter what your tax situation may be, Turbo has it covered. Also provides the option for &#34;audit protection&#34;. Worth every penny.<br />Most importantly, it removes the drudgery of filing the state form. Turbo does it for you."
1,"I've used Turbo Tax for many years and it has never failed me.  Turbo Tax is easy to use, answers your questions, and has an excellent support system."
1,"I recommend avast! to all my friends, family, and even co-workers.  I use it on all my personal machines, and have been very pleased with the performance of not just the antivirus software, but the other handy features they included.  It makes sure my other programs are current and up to-date and keeps itself updated in the background.<br /><br />I have been using avast! for years, and will continue to do so, if avast! keeps things as great as they have so far.  Thanks!"
0,"I purchased this software in hopes of recreating an existing home.  The trouble I have had is with the fine detail I require.  Creating a 6\\"" jog in a wall, or odd configurations has been a real challenge.  In the end I finally gave up and continued looking for a better alternative.<br /><br />I found what appears to be an older (looks wise) program that does everything I need it to with ease.  It gives very precise control in a very approachable manner.  It is not your big name brand, there is no 3D views and walkthroughs, but what it does is allow the user to focus on what really matters the plan and the details of the plan.  The program is title Home Plan Pro and can be located online."
1,"I've been using TurboTax for 5 years now and find it very easy to navigate through,  easily got answers to any questions I had and was able to file easily.  Have already gotten my FED refund.  Had to answer the STATE quiz and am not expecting that refund for a couple months.<br />I highly recommend TurboTax to the homeowner whose income/expenses are relatively normal."
1,works great keeps track of all your stuff
0,"Slow and cumbersome to enter assets. Frustrating as it changes items as you go...found an error and corrected it on the return, (1 line item) took another hour to get Turbo Tax to quit adjusting Retained earnings (increasing them by several hundred thousand dollars)..    Turbo Tax, \\""We calculate your retained earnings to be X\\"", You click YES they are X. Turbo Tax. Oh..wait..now they are Y. Clearly that process deleted something...    Another frustrating glitch is the future year's depreciation statement is no longer easily accessible.      One bit of good news for small businesses that pay their employees tips, the FORM 8846 is a part of this package for the first time!"
0,"My fault for not listening to the negative reviews. I thought if I was starting fresh without the upgrade that perhaps things would be different for me. NOPE! I have been chatting with a rep for 105 minutes to no avail trying to find out why I am getting duplicate entries on my downloads in one of my accounts. There may be some functions of this that work okay, but overall this software does not work. Don't waste your money. I should have listened."
1,it's freaking great. Whats not to love. Thanks
0,"I've been another software user for several years and decided to give H&R Block a try after a software snafu with the State last year.  While this software is somewhat straightforward when entering data, I did not find it nearly as user friendly.  I am not an accountant, nor am I up on what forms need to be submitted when mailing in returns.  I printed out what the program automatically set up in the print queue only to then read the directions provided by the program and find out I needed an additional form.  I had to go back in and spend time searching for the additional form.  I will be going back to my previous software."
1,"The best you can get...tried other products, and went back to this one.  Everyone one in the family uses it."
1,Good program. Easy to use.
0,Not very useable as it doesn't allow changes and adjustments.
0,"Have used online Turbotax through investment company for years.  Thought this digital download would save money, but disappointed to realize additional fees apply for efiling state returns, increasing the cost of this product by $20."
1,"I had so many questions when I began my business in late 2014. Several quotes came in from accountants and bank referrals. No one came close to the service and pricing offered by quickbooks. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like Quickbooks will guide me properly along the way."
0,"I upgraded from Quicken 2011 and encountered problems - the online update with one of my banks is no longer automatic, the categories Quicken now inserts for downloaded transactions are wrong more frequently (it used to be pretty good).  I really liked how the &#34;FIND&#34; function was at the top of the account register - now it's hidden behind the EDIT menu or or the CONTROL key.  I only upgraded because Intuit was going to charge me for customer support calls if I didn't upgrade."
1,"Avast still ranks among the best of the free AV software options, but it is rapidly becoming more and more like the behemoths it originally tried to differentiate itself from.  Some of the reasons many people grew dissatisfied with (and stopped buying/using) the major AV software companies' offerings were bloat and add-ons which slowed down the software and sometimes even compromised the entire OS performance.<br />By adding newer features like Online Security and Software Updater, Avast is trying to be all things to all people (Norton, anyone?).  Little annoyances like the unstoppable/unavoidable browser window popup for an Online Security upgrade show that Avast is heading in the same direction as the &#34;Big Boys&#34; whose shortcomings first opened the door for Avast (and others) in the first place.<br />The Avast AV engine is still one of the most transparent and easiest to activate/use, and it doesn't let too many things slip by.  When paired with good pop-up blocking and a decent firewall it provides most basic users with adequate free protection.  Future upgrades/releases will be telling as to what direction Avast goes."
1,"Avast is a really great anti-virus program and just a really all-around great computer keeper upper.  I love it bc I use it on all my devices and it works seamlessly to protect me no matter if I'm using my laptop, my tablet or my ipod or phone.  Whatever, it always is there.  I recommend it bc it is easy and fast and doesn't get in the way like a lot of other prgrms.Buy it!!!"
0,It is as advertised. It is very overpriced. Have to pay extra for more fillings. Nothing bad nothing special. It works as expected. I give very high marks only  for extraordinary performance or features I did not expect.
1,I write and publish several newsletters and have been using Publisher for some time.  Needed to be updated I can view the same screenviews with a colleague.  Downloaded and installed perfectly like most Microsoft Products.  This software is for serious users in my opinion.<br />Recommend
0,"Should start off by saying one-star rating is no reflection on Amazon.  I order many, many items on Amazon and have never had any issue of any kind with them.  Anyway, can't comment too much on the actual software - didn't use it for long enough because I decided to cut my losses and purchase Quickbooks afterwards (as an aside, pretty happy with that so far).  Reason why I ditched is because Sage customer service is among the worst I've ever experienced.  I'm not an accountant and it's not as easy as Quickbooks to get into, so I wanted to spend the weekend getting to grips with the program.  Unfortunately for me the software shuts you down after 5 uses if you don't register - regardless of having a serial number plugged in.  Okay, fine np...unless it's at the weekend when their website is screwy and they don't bother to staff their CS Dept.  Then you're out of luck.  The in-app help isn't too helpful, so I decided to order the Basic Training Manual from their website.  Paid for two-day shipping because I was keen to get into the program.  Just over a week later with no word on shipping I try to call the CS Dept.  I gave up on the first two calls because I was passed from agent to agent and department to department in an endless search to get a shipping date.  I was losing the will to live.  Third time lucky I thought so I tried again the next day.  In all fairness, The CSR I finally spoke to tried to be helpful - it's just that her rudimentary grasp of the English language and obviously woefully-inadequate training got in the way of any real assistance she may have been able to provide.  She estimated that shipping would probably...perhaps...take place in 3-5 days...hopefully...but that she would consult with the \\""team\\"" and get back to me within 48 hours.  The team!!  I'm talking about a $50 dollar web order for a user guide here people!!  Presumably if I'd placed a large or particularly esoteric order they would have had to consult with the UN before providing me with shipping info!  It was after that 'phone call that I decided I wanted nothing more to do with Sage even if it was going to cost me another 100 or so bucks to ditch it and buy Quickbooks instead.  They say that Peachtree is more powerful than QB and that may well be true - it's certainly harder to get into - but if you just need a program to look after your small-business accounts I would stay away from Peachtree if I were you.  Woe betide you if you should need to call customer service."
1,"great support and great product. I have 2 laptops at home. Both were infected with malware. Everytime I use internet explorer or Firefox to browse the internet, I get popup ads everywhere. One of the laptop was running really slow, so slow that my wife stopped using it for 3-4 months and wanted to buy a new laptop because she was so frustrated. I purchased the Norton 360, and after couple of hours of scanning the laptop and great tech support from Norton, both of my laptops are running like new."
0,"Amazon bated me into this purchase with an e-mail promising a discount for Prime Members. Then Charged full price! Then sent me a credit for the future purchase of a product I never intend on buying. When it came to download the product (Turbo Tax) it is listed as a 114 MB download. I click to begin the download, it downloads a 1.0 MB program and gives me the &#34;Download Complete&#34; message (which I know can't be true) in less than .05 seconds. Now it expects me to run another program to get my TurboTax product. At this point, I so distrust the process due to the misleading statements, I'm not sure I want to run this other program not knowing where it may lead me next or what will be introduced into my computer in the process. I was a very happy 2 Year Prime Member before tonight."
0,Very poor landscaping software.  Essentially its a home design software with a few very poor landscaping add-ons.
1,"Well when stuff goes south - &#34;Who ya goinna call&#34; -<br />I purchased this on Amazon and the download comes from Microsoft.<br />I got into some trouble with the download and their tech talked me through it with grace and ease.<br /><br />Then my phone was running out of minutes ... let the tech know and all was well with his assistance.<br /><br />Then my GB - gigabytes hit the limit and I needed to add<br /><br />What to do ? Well I listened to the tech and all went well.<br /><br />Got the phone charged - but didn't need it<br /><br />Got GBs the next day and a day after that I logged on and Office 365 finished loading.<br /><br />&#34;Honest to God !&#34; almost 2 days in the making -<br />NO I never did anything like this ever before -<br />I'm talking about taking so much time to do something simple, but Microsoft had it covered !<br />I have never been so impressed !<br />Actually, most interfaces with MS in the past have not been helpful.<br /><br />Hey - Microsoft - this is what people need and expect.<br /><br />I give your tech 5 Stars as well !"
0,Be aware!!!!!!! Don't buy this kind of freaking software online. It has virus in it. My computer frozen all the time since I installed the freaking software. I have to buy a new computer.
1,"As expected, the software was fast and easy to download. It had some upgrades, but I run a really small business so I didn't need quite all the bells and whistles. It was still a better deal and of course, I still had my records from the older version."
1,2012 served me just fine but Quicken forced us to upgrade to continue syncing with online banking.  Wouldn't have upgraded otherwise.  Glad I could upgrade for a reasonable price at Amazon... Twice as much from Quicken.
0,Very sneaky price hike. This will be my last year to use Turbotax.
0,"Norton has changed Identity Safe from a system that stores passwords both on your computer and in the cloud to one that is cloud based exclusively.  Plus there is a bug that takes about two hours of online tech support to partially correct per computer.  I purchased the 1user - 3 computer product so I have to go through the whole tech support BS for each one.  Finally with the cloud based identity safe, if Norton's site is down or unavailable for any reason which is not that infrequent, you are out of luck as far as retrieving your passwords.  Unless they change this system I'll be going to a different product next year."
0,"Well everyone, I should have read the reviews.  First of all, Amazon has been awesome.  Just call them.  I got a full refund.<br /><br />I'm on a Mac and just like for everyone else, the product does not install.<br /><br />So if you're a Mac user, stay away until the company has resolved the issue.  (Apparently Amazon is waiting for them to do so.)"
1,"I do admit that the download/register process was a bit confusing but ultimately, if you are carefull and read all instructions it all works as advertised. I feel that all the bad reviews are not deserved."
0,What you see is not what you get with Turbo Tax. Pricing structure for options is deceptive. Fed & State does not mean you get state e-file that is an expensive extra. This year I changed to Tax Act. It’s not as easy to use as Turbo Tax but is more than half the price and do taxes gust as well.
1,Easy and always reliable.
0,"I purchased the quicken download and had nothing but problems.. The chat help people didn't know any of the answers that I proposed to them and were very lazy in trying to look up answers, but couldn't find the answers. Getting very fustrated I tried there customer call back feature  what a experience.. first they tell you they will call you back in 2 hours then you get a email that they will call you within the hour 3 hours later you finall get a call back but you can't understand the person talking nor the message that he leaves.. finally I gave up and requested a refund which they did grant me now I have 2010 version and want to get back to trouble free 2009.  Do I dare call tech help.... not on your life.. I will stick with the free version and try to figure out how to fix it.. its just very fustrating when you sign into 2010 it welcomes you to the 2008 version"
0,This program should be titled Quicken for Dummies.   It only does the basic stuff and if you download it you're stuck with it.  You need to upgrade to the $84 program if you have investments you'd like to include.  Buyer beware!  And if you do still want it buy the package and don't download. Downloads can't be returned!
1,GREAT
1,"Simple to use and comprehensive enough for keeping track of investments and Income tax records. I have used Quicken since my first DOS 5 computer, and I recommend it to anyone who wants an easy way to keep track of all finances, income and outgo."
1,"I have used H&R Block tax software for 10 years, after using TurboTax for several years. I much prefer the flow of this program."
1,"Exceeded expectations, thank you"
1,"After I ordered this I figured out how to use my old Microsoft Money program on my Windows 7 computer. Since they are basically the same I am sure this is a wonderful program. I am keeping it, of course, I never know when I might want it."
0,"I was able to run DVD's fine for the most part, but it wouldn't play my Blu-Ray Disc which was the whole reason I bought it.  I went to uninstall and re install after trying all different settings and configurations, and it asked for my product key again.  It didn't accept the code.  If you want some software that works, maybe do some more research so you don't end up like me."
1,"I have had Quicken for many years now, and I love the tools that Quicken provides for me to keep track of my finances."
1,"3rd year of using Turbo Tax instead of H&R Block. Very similar but find interview method overlooks some items, and is inflexible in other areas. I always check it against an Excel spreadsheet I made years ago before tax software became so common. Can't e-file if you override any entries. That's not a big deal (yet). Also don't like that I have to buy most expensive version because I file Schedule C for my business."
0,"Wow, I've been a loyal TT user for many years as I have multiple properties. I was researching which TT to buy this year and discovered that both Deluxe and Home business may not meet my needs due to the forms that TT no longer includes and the expense limits and override ability.  Glad I read the reviews.  I've been considering trying a different tax prep software for a few years now since TT is in my opinion NOT the easiest software to use, but I put it off because of the hassle of  re-entering all the data that TT automatically transfers year-to-year. But frankly TT just made that hassle worth the effort.  Not to mention that H&R Deluxe is $40 versus $94.  And give me a break, TT has been advertising a &#34;limited time&#34; offer of up to $15 off every week for the last month, but you look at the various retailers and I don't see any special values.  Done with TT"
1,"read the comments on how to set up and yeah, you'll be set. it works fine and i got it way cheaper than i would have normally."
0,"software is ok. my main gripe is that it costs an additional $20 to file an extension, the simplest for out there. will be switching back to turbo tax next year."
0,"Cengage is a utter joke, I cannot tell you how displeased i am with this company and its software and curriculum. First my entire class had to contact customer support (of which is very limited) because it messed up the course code. 2nd the tests are extremely time consuming. I could take 3 &#34;in class&#34; courses that require less time than this one partial online course. The tests are very time consuming and confusing, they are worded very difficult and are misleadingly written in book. DO NOT TAKE A COURSE THAT OFFERS THIS BOOK! Awful!"
0,"Intuit has crippled current versions of TurboTax by requiring the use of an online &#34;secure printing service&#34; in order to print or export-to-pdf. Their public statements as to why this is suddenly a requirement are boldfaced lies. (they claim that their software cannot print without this &#34;service&#34;, but their own helps print and export-to-pdf just fine without it).<br /><br />I repeat -- your tax returns are being sent to Intuit even if you are just printing to your own local printer!<br /><br />I regret having purchased this software, but it will likely be the last time. Fool me once, etc.<br /><br />I understand that a number of folks have gotten refunds from Intuit based on this defect."
1,Just installed how  can I give you a honest review???? Don't you think maybe you should wait about 90 days?
1,This gets out some of the viruses that Norton and mcafee does not recognize.  Would highly recommend it.  Get other free malware and adware removal downloads and youll be protected on most.
1,This is a great help for anyone who wants to improve typing capabilities. The software allows you to start at any level and repeat anything you wish. There is also practice and more. Enjoy.
1,"Works great, especially for the price."
1,I just renewed with P C Matic for 2nd year and trust them thoroughly.  Haven't had any issues with my computer and I thank PC Matic for it.  Feel my computer runs virus free and is fast.
0,"Now that I have updated to Quicken 2015 the program will not recognize my vault password.  What the heck, I haven't changed it so why????  Not happy with this update"
0,The software is good but Intuit's business model is a failure. I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since the 90s but this will be my last  year. I talked to many people that dropped the product this year and expect there will be many more next year. At the rate Intuit is going there will only be two software packages in the future. A very basic package and a very expensive package because they keep moving standard features into a higher priced product.
0,"It is the single best option for capturing video from the major services but still has some big flaws. Must annoying is that when beginning to record a Netflix stream and you have it set to the far more convenient 'auto'  setting, it thinks that you are recording a new program each time Netflix changes the resolution as it rests bandwidth and buffers. For instance, if I begin recording Pretty In Pink, Netflix starts it out at 640x360, then as it spools up to 854x480 and then to 1280x720, Audials will record it as 3 different recordings. If it smells doesn't break it up, you will get dropped frames at each resolution change. There is no adjustment to fix this.<br /><br />Secondly, although the resolution and quality settings are very customizable, recordings use a lot of CPU resources; I would say that they are abnormally high, even considering the use of the x264 encoder. I could literally find no setting of any good quality that would record 720p without making out my AMD x4 955 or FX-6100. Frames rate issues seem to exist here, as judder is nearly inevitable. The only way I have found to get any kind of consistent results is to set the encoder to use the .wmv high quality settings and set it to match the frame rate of the source (which generally seems to be 25 fps). The resulting files are huge, about 8GB per hour. I just reencode them to .mkv or .mp4 with Handbrake. Gives me better results than if I had just captured in this format in the first place. I wouldn't even consider trying to capture in 1080p unless I was running an i5 2500k, Octo-core AMD or i7.<br /><br />I wish that Audials had a queue feature like It's competitor, PlayLater. It allows.you to queue up a couple dozen programs and they just get recorded one after the other. The video quality from Audials CAN definitely be better than Play Later, but when you're just trying to get an entire season of My Little Pony, the queue feature is just a much bigger factor."

0,"Goodbye, TurboTax.  Next year I'll be using H&R Block."
0,"I don't see much difference in this and my previous 2012 version.  I upgraded because they were going to cancel my banking transaction downloading ability if I didn't upgrade.  I don't like that I feel bullied by Quicken, but I have to use it for my finance management."

0,Worst antivirus software I have ever used.
0,"I rarely feel strongly enough about products to come write a review, but after the umpteenth random crash, I've decided to come in here and join the masses.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a very sub-par piece of software that takes what should be a reasonably straight forward exercise of compiling information and turns it into a perpetually crashing, error prone piece of garbage.<br /><br />I use this software mostly just to automatically collect and store transactions from a variety of investment accounts; I don't require the advanced features of the budgeting or break-downs by category, so I am unable to review these features. Unfortunately, this program is the only game in town that I know of that easily logs into each account and obtains the information, but even this is very hit-or-miss (especially at Vanguard, where I constantly must re-enter dividend information that never makes it into Quicken).<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade to 2015 via Quicken's 'forced obsolescence' business model of perfectly good Quicken 2012, which meant it would no longer obtain market quotes etc for my portfolio. So basically, I'm forced to shell out money every 2 years for a program just to keep functionality alive. Which wouldn't be so bad, if the new program could actually do all of the same things the original did without crashing.<br /><br />This version is simply garbage. It constantly tries to update itself and fails, it constantly freezes, randomly crashes to desktop, and lags out at performing the most mundane of calculations. Really, grouping investments based on investing goal and running an IRR should not cause a fatal error, especially as this software is 20 years old...<br /><br />Its honestly so terrible that I think it has convinced me to finally pull the plug. I think I will just build some spreadsheets that take my electronic statements and aggregate it all.<br /><br />I have no faith that all of my transactions have been successfully transferred from my investment accounts, I don't trust many of the calculations I do see (unless they are the most simplistic of Sell/Buy), and I'm tired of constantly crashing."
0,"Having used Quicken since 1991, I have upgraded Quicken every year since my initial introduction to Quicken.  I have seen good years and bad years.  2012 was not a particularly good year.  I read so much negative about 2013, it was the first year I ever skipped updating Quicken.  I decided to wait a year since they moved all development to India.<br /><br />Intuit management considers Quicken no longer to be a strategic product as evidenced that it is not even mentioned in the corporate annual report.  They are doing all they can to move people to Mint.com.  I will never ever move to a &#34;cloud based&#34; personal financial solution & would highly discourage people from doing so.  Accessing my banking via the web is one thing since I can't much influence their privacy and security controls.  Having 20+ years of my personal financial data sitting in some unknown location totally outside my control is beyond what I would ever feel comfortable with.  (Won't use their cloud based tax solutions either.)<br /><br />The 2014 edition of Quicken Premier routinely prompts you to get you to use their &#34;mobile app&#34;.  Note it uses their cloud solution.  Won't ever use it!  Thus it is on zero value to me.  I was hoping it would connect to my PC based DB via my wireless network, but no such luck.<br /><br />As of late December 2014, the 2014 edition is still buggy.  Screens freeze, data lines are weird at times, runs more slowly than 2012, etc.  It may be that I am still on Windows XP SP3, but that has never been an issue in the past.  One can only hope they fix the reliability issues before 2015 comes out."
1,I purchased Avast after discovering  a bad virus and was amazed by the lengths the Avast team went to cleaning it up and restoring my computer like new. I've tried the popular ones over the years but none compare to Avast and  I  highly recommend it.
0,"I could not get this to work on my laptop.  Even with all correct updates, RIBBIT couldn't even help me."
1,"I've used TaxCut/H&R Block for years.  Gathering the information took more time than actually entering it into the program.  I started late yesterday afternoon and by bedtime, I had e-filed my return.  I highly recommend this package."
1,"This is the best I have seen for a MAC. It does the job of tracking costs from different accounts, credit cards, etc. The feature of getting a breakdown by category of all costs in any given date range is very useful. Then you can easily drill down to specific items due to the hyperlinks in the summary page. I cannot give it a 5 star as it requires payment of fees to directly link to my credit cards. I have to download the statements from the card website, individually."
0,Great product for a while until Garmin decided not to maintain their maps for Windows XP. You spend all this money for a lifetime subscription and in just a few short years they essentially cancel that subscription because they're too cheap to support the system that you bought the system under.
1,"This is a totally dependable, free antivirus that's so good, they even use it where I work!  If you need a good antivirus, go for it!"
0,"Why take away basic features that made older versions so easy to use. I only got this because I was in a bind, and I can't even use the features I was accustomed to. I would have bought Print Shop v23 again and saved myself $50. Granted this might be perfect for others, but I really just need the older version. Others are right to say this looks like it was made for a child to use.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VUM9XM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_37"

0,"They suck, they removed part of the tax return they have allowed to be done for years and years, now the upgrade is $30. Time to look for another Tax program. Beware when buying this, you may not be able to complete your return."
1,"&#34; OLD FAITHFUL&#34; I have been using Norton for over 4 years and never had a virus problem, so I think it deserves a 5 five star rating very good tool,,, Jack Hanks."
0,My fault. Purchased the wrong book.
1,Have used it for over 10 years. Gets easier every year.
1,Free.  Fun.  Educational.  What more can you want in something for a little one.  And you can vary the trip so you are not sitting so long.  We usually only do the 3 or 5 stop trip so that we are not looking at the computer for so long.  We also have Melissa and Doug's 50 state map and our 30 month old can name every state and put that puzzle together.  This supplements and is a good review of the states as well as the capitals.
0,"I'm familiar with video editing software, and Premiere Elements is my favorite. However, I purchased this one because I didn't want to foot the bill for Elements. Well, I ended up getting Elements anyway because this program just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I operate a website where videos are necessary, first of all, so I need something that can help me edit quickly. There are too many functions, none of which I needed. Splicing content was difficult, and more often than not, sound disappeared. I couldn't add titles to different sections on top of videos either, so this was a no. I've been doing videos for years, and this just made me feel like a beginner again, and not in a good way!"
1,"What's not to like? I had this processor software on my laptop and really missed it since I switched to Mac. The price is free, so you don't have a thing to lose in trying it. If you like to do flyers, print labels, type letters or any other kind of document you do in word, then this program is great on your Mac. The download was quick and painless, and installation a breeze also.<br />Think no further, just do yourself a favor and get it while it's free."
1,"it's free and it works GREAT , I would us this program again for a friend or a buddy or his friends"
0,The student verification process is difficult and confusing.  We were not able to accomplish it using the Amazon purchase and had to purchase Office 365 directly from Microsoft to accomplish the student verification.  Amazon was great in dealing with a refund that was an exception to their general rules.
1,It is pretty good for begginners
1,Excellent software
1,"Software downloaded quickly, easy to use, covered all bases, pulled my previous years info from 2013 return on my PC, helpful info if you have questions, love the interactive score board showing your refund in green or in red for what you will owe IRS from beginning to end, reviewed my return for accuracy & potential for Audits. Jumped right into my State return...Worked perfectly, no issues what so ever. EFiled (accepted by the IRS within 2hrs) notified by email, PDF copy on my PC for records, plus I printed out hard copy for my file.  Only left my desk for coffee & donuts!"
0,"I spent 2.5 hours on the phone yesterday only to have TurboTax determine that there are multiple bugs in the program.  Example, I entered insurance information for the LLC S corp. and TurboTax displays it as Wages Paid.  TurboTax claims I have foreign income and I don't.  The tech support agent uploaded a copy and determined that these were bugs.  Today, I received a notice that the case is closed.  I spent another 15 minutes on the phone asking why it was closed, and the agent explained that the case &#34;only represented the phone call and all cases are closed when the call ends&#34;.  I have no way to track the progress of the fix, understand the priority or if it's even in the development queue.  I have used TurboTax in the past, and this is VERY disappointing."

0,"The Premier version is advertised as being adequate for handling rental property, however, it does not properly handle the sale of a personal vehicle partially used and depreciated for rental purposes."
1,"The online tools are so helpful, that every business at any size and monitary range should use this for simple record keeping."
1,No problems with the SW protection.  Operating as advertised.
1,"I would recommend this product to anyone that needs specific page sizes, or other custom items.  It is easy to use and the free graphics through Daisy Trail are pretty good."
1,"The new version has a few improvements, but I would need to be a much more sophisticated user to take advantage of them.  I price of admission is a little high."
1,"Very very very very useful. If you are going to college, working where you need excel, powerpoint for classes, and easy commands for documents, then i suggest you purchase this."
1,Easy to use especially once you become a repeat customer.
1,"Great product, Easy to use, full featured, I wanted to make a highlight tape of my daughter's high school field hockey games for recruiting purposes. VideoStudio Pro X6 made me look good! Well worth the money."
0,"SOOO very disappointed in Adobe's new model.  If you take someone like me that used Illustrator only somewhat regularly, often skipping a month or two without using it at all, this is simply going to force me out.  Let's say I need it for a project that takes 3 hours.  And that's all I use it for in a 6-month period.  I'm paying Adobe $180 to &#34;rent&#34; their software for that one project.  I suppose I could go through the hassle of stopping and starting the subscription every time I open it up or decide I don't need it for a while... but then if I need to pop it open again a week later, I have to pay the $30 again.  Of course I'm not going to do that, so... yeah, basically when my old version of Illustrator ceases to function next time I upgrade a computer or an OS, I'm just out.  Very sad.  I've loved Illustrator over the last 15+ years of working with it."
1,it's great for someone who has problems typing I love it for that
0,This software is not what I expected at all. The features I was expecting are not what I was expecting. Do a little research before buying.
1,"I like the feature of if someone passes on before you, you list alternate beneficiaries.  The notorizations cost almost as much as the program.  A great value.  An attourney would charge hundreds."
1,I am very happy with my purchase of Norton 360.  It was a fast and easy download from Amazon Software Library onto my PC (Windows XP O/S) with no problems. Norton 360 has a friendly GUI and quickly cleared up free space on my 500GB hard drive. I especially like the Spam Blocking and Norton Pulse features. Excellent anti-virus protection and great price. Highly recommended.
0,I am really looking forward to a book that covers the software so I don't have to spend so much time and effort to get some features under control.  I am new to this program and I am new to the MAC. I used Quicken years ago and don't remember any of that experience.  I guess I am looking for a new version of Quicken 2015 for dummies.  I think that I will like the program in time so I am going to put in the effort because I think that it will be worth it.
0,"I'll chime in with support for all the negative reviews.  First, thanks to everyone who took the time to write a review.  As in the past 10 years or so, I was ready to hit the buy button for the Deluxe version when I noticed the 1.5 star rating.  The reviews saved me from a big mistake.  I need both Schedules C and D, so I'm off to HR Block with the many others who are taking this course."
1,Best every after years of using another program I am sad I didn't find this one sooner!
1,It was excellent. The process was easy and I  received my money in one week. Thank God for new technology.
1,I think it is the best thing  I have used my computer for to date..The improvments that have come out  since II started using TurboTax are great and every year it gets better.........Keep up the good work.........<br /><br />PS  I have  been telling all my friends  about how easy it is to do taxes with TurboTax..
1,This is good solution...
1,Have this free anti-virus on all my computers. Warns me when I enter a suspect web site or e-mail and cleans out any Malware when It scans. I highly recommend it.
1,"I upgraded from Quicken Home & Business 2014, and before that I used Quicken 2013 and 2012. Before that I was an avid MS Money user. So I admit that I'm a bit biased because despite the last few years, I still lament the passing of MS money.<br /><br />The changes from Quicken were subtle. I must admit I actually like having My credit score pop up in the bottom left part of the screen, although the drawback there is that my family, like many, has two primary breadwinners, and it would have been nice to have the option for a second score (although my wife tells me that might have been a problem in a competitive household). The other thing about the Credit Score is that I'm unfamiliar with how that's determined... Quicken reports my credit score a full 38 points lower than Credit Karma (say day) does and about the same number of points lower than the last time I checked my official score. So while it's not a killer (it still says I'm in the same bracket), I've always been leery of credit scores reported.<br /><br />I really don't have much of a use for the Portfolio X-Ray feature as most of my investments are in my family's TSP accounts, which are not evaluated. So it seems like a nice feature that I might use in the future.<br /><br />An unintended benefit is that when I upgraded from 2013 to 2014, somehow I locked myself out of the mobile ID/App and could never get back in to use the Quicken 2014 app. It was irritating, but I had Mint to supplement. I tried deleting the account, but it never worked, and I never figured out why (the ambiguous put in your Zip code and we'll email you a password NEVER worked). With the new 2015 version, this worked so much better! It simply have me the option of upgrading everything with a new password. Problem solved. That's a big ding to the 2014 version, and a plus to this version.<br /><br />Other than those I don't see any dramatic changes. I was hoping for some improvements in some quirks that I have with saved Payees and previously-used-categories, but there has been no change what-so-ever. I assume that the mechanics are all,generally, exactly the same.<br /><br />So I'm not totally sure that the $72.99 for the download on Amazon is worth the upgrade, but after the MS Money fiasco, I try and upgrade every year... Just so Quicken doesn't forget about us."
0,I was willing to pay more for turbotax ($39) vs taxact ($12) because turbotax was easier to use. However this year there's no way I am going to pay $80 vs $12 just because it's easier to use.<br /><br />Completely ridiculous that if I sold 1 share of a mutual fund I have to pay 100% more just to get that schedule?<br /><br />Obviously they're trying to chisel as much money as possible. I'm done with this - intuit just gave taxact a long time client.
1,"I was looking for a video editor that is easy to use. I wanted one that if I stopped using it for six months I could easily go back to it and start editing without a big learning curve. I wanted the software interface to be uncluttered, and the software had to be stable.  I wanted one that would do all the basics well but had a little room to learn and grow.<br /><br />After trying a number of video editors using the 30 day free trials, Corel VideoStudio X5 stood out among them all.  First of all, the software is nicely layed out.  It has the usual three sections for importing video, editing video and exporting video or burning to a DVD.  Each section is mostly straight forward, however I kept the manual open on my desktop and looked up a few things here and there as I was editing.<br /><br />I was able to take about  an hour of AVCHD video (as five separate clips), trim them, adjusted their quality, put them in sequence with transitions into the timeline, as well as a good title (with soundtrack behind the title) in about 1.5 hours from the point of downloading the software.  That's pretty impressive.<br /><br />For those new to editing, I would recommend keeping your project to a couple of clips totaling 10 minutes or less.<br /><br />I was able to consult the very well written manual that helped me find what I need. I have some previous experience editing experience from about a decade ago (but mostly forgotten), so I would think most people could produce a simple video using the basic capabilities of the software in an hour to a couple of hours, depending on your computer skills, any previous editing experience, length of the video, number of clips, and how many tricks you want to throw at it.<br /><br />The nice thing about Pro X5 is that it's simple software gives you the impression this is just a simple editor.  However if you consult the manual there is tons of functionality to explore.  Just about everything you'd want to do can be done by this editor.  Unless you have real pro aspirations (and want to spend a lot of time figuring out why you messed up your timeline) this is the way to go.<br /><br />The video editor is stable.  I'm using Windows 7 on a desktop with a quad core AMD processor, four gigabytes of memory and an average video card by 2012 standards.  I'm able to render and burn a one hour length program on DVD in an hour and forty-five minutes using a slow DVD burner (pretty impressive).<br /><br />If you want a well thought out, stable video editor, that has lots more options should you choose to explore them later, then get this software.  I downloaded several other 30 day trials by the big names, and this product clearly stands out on top for ease of use, functionality and stability!"
1,Product was easy and quick to download.  Everything seems to be working fine.  I love the idea of not having to wait for my product in the mail it was just a click away and I could have instant access to my product.
1,Mcafee works in the background Has never slowed my computer at all . Had Norton for years but I would recommend this to anyone
1,"I am a person that looks at the bright side of things . . . so I took Intuit at their word when they claimed the last update to their software fixed most of the connectivity issues with mobile devices . . . I should have known better. Intuit is marketing a product that nearly everyone is causing nearly everyone hours of frustration. I spend three hours with it and I am done. I purchased this through Amazon as a download. If they do not issue a refund very quickly . . . notice I said very quickly . . . I will begin pursuing a class-action lawsuit against them. Anyone care to join? I find it interesting that nearly every major software manufacturer out there . . . even those producing suites that cost $1500 (Adobe) offer at least a 15 day trial (most are 30 days) of their product at no charge. You only pay at the end of the trial period if you like your experience. Yet Intuit does not offer such a program (at least not one that I am aware of). So . . . since Intuit monitors these reviews, I pose the question . . . Why do you not offer a trial period for your software? (I think everyone that has bought their flawed product already knows the answer.)  Considering how many problems there are with this product, I almost consider their sale of this software \\""bait-and-switch.\\"" I have worked with computers and software for more than 30 years. I have bought lots of software. Never have I seen such an irresponsible release of a product that is still in the developmental stage Problem is, Intuit doesn't understand that. They are so inept at understanding the functionality of their product they think it is a \\""prime time\\"" piece of work. There should be some people losing their jobs over this fiasco. Stay posted. I will keep everyone advised on how they handle my request for a refund. It is my opinion that Amazon should pull Quicken 2013 from their product offerings. I will let you know what their response is to that suggestion.<br /><br />Update 10/18<br />Well I have to give credit to Intuit for following through so quickly on my dissatisfaction with Quicken 2013. I literally got an e-mail from them within hours of my post . . . very impressive. And I could tell there was definitely a genuine apologetic tone to their response.I had used Quicken for nearly 15 years, but went a new direction about five years ago so I could have connectivity to my smartphone. So I was really excited when I heard about the 2013 version. Anyway . . . looks like I am back to Mvelopes. Thanks Intuit to getting my problem squared away. (Issuing a refund). Well done!<br /><br />Update 11/8  Heard that all the bugs which drove me to request a refund have supposedly been resolved. So . . . I will give them one more try. I used to be a user of Quicken 2010 before switching to Mvelopes. Not a lot new in Quicken 2013, but since I am operating my own business, I will give Quicken's Home & Business a try. If things go well, I will probably use both Mvelopes & Quicken. May be buying it all over again.<br /><br />Update 11/11<br />I have now been using Quicken 2013 for nearly a week. This has been a start over experience after my very disappointing first date with the product several weeks back which prompted me to ask for a refund. I like how things are going. I had been a long time Quicken user, but had jumped ship about three years ago in pursuit of a financial tool that had a good Android app. Over the years, I think I have tried nearly everything YNAB, Moneydance, Pocketsmith, Yodlee, etc. I have finally settled on two programs Mvelopes and Quicken 2013 Home and Office. I will continue to use Mvelopes because it provides a great weekly budget option . . . Quicken does not. But I have always loved the customization features of Quicken that helps me see the info the way I want it. And I like the ability to use my finance app offline as well as online. People (including myself) are highly opinionated about their finance software. Everyone has their own particular way theywant the information about their bank accounts and budget to be managed. After having been around the block with nearly 10 - 12 different finance apps, I have concluded that Quicken is one of the best for my family situation. If quicken had a weekly budgeting feature, I would drop Mvelopes and be all in with Intuit. Quicken is not perfect, but I am still glad to be back with Quicken. I am going to run it through the trial period and if everything contines to work as expected, I will repurchase it. I am also looking forward to using the Quicken interface for running the books on my videography business."
0,"Beware of the changes they made to Turbotax this year. The odds are that whatever version you used last year will not be sufficient for you this year. You will have to send more of your money to an organization that has not earned it.<br /><br />I've used TurboTax and Quicken for years and have always loved Intuit's products. But the leadership of this company has done everything they can to destroy loyalty, and due to recent changes I won't be using any Intuit products anymore. I've held out for years hoping they would make a corporate strategy shift, but they haven't. I'm done.<br /><br />They have recently tried to make amends to the TurboTax users they harmed with the changes this year by offering a $25 rebate. Although that's a great step, it doesn't make up for complete idiocy from Intuit's leadership. If that was the only boneheaded decision they had made, I might be able to let it go.<br /><br />But in 2011 I switched to Mac as millions of their users have, and they have refused to support Quicken for Mac. Just now, in 2015, 5 years into the Macbook &#34;revolution,&#34; they decided to release a Mac version of Quicken that is a dummed down version of the desktop software, offering hardly any features above the free online version. There are plenty of viable alternatives to Quicken on Mac at 1/3 price.<br /><br />This type of decision making is not in line with a company that positions itself as one with excellent customer service, and they no longer deserve my business."
1,Plan maker downloaded without any issue. I am yet to take the software through the paces.
1,"I used Webroot for several years prior to this purchase and had a couple of issues with it, but I thought for the most part it was doing the job. However, upon installing Norton it immediately found viruses that were undetected by Webroot. And Norton's price was better too! I have recommended Norton to everyone."
1,It is very good
0,This is incredibly lame.  It doesn't know anything about stocks or stock funds.  So if you have any brokerage accounts or stocks forget about his program.
0,"I've used TurboTax in the past and one year used a CPA to prepare my taxes (that was a horror, the man apparently didn't even know what a 529 plan was and cost me quite a bit of money because he gave back my return late afternoon on April 15 so I ran to the post office before checking it, my mistake), but recently I've been using H&R Block.  Last year the process was painless and I got a nice little refund fairly quickly (efiling and direct deposit).  This year has been a mess.  The program is good, the questions it asks are the usual ones, and it was very helpful for me since this year was the first year that I was also filing for my partnership business (not incorporated).  A few steps were confusing, such as asking about scholarships, which took me a bit to realize that I only needed to deduct the scholarship if it paid for something other than tuition or books (are there scholarships that do that?).  It took me a bit longer than usual, because I had to read some of the descriptions when it came to putting in tuition, and I was a bit concerned that when it asked for the information in my 1098-T it didn't clarify that I should deduct the scholarship amount from the tuition paid (which is what I assume since the scholarship is not tuition money I paid but it's not taxable either) so it seems to me the program is a bit lacking in some areas.  Still, much easier than sitting down with a tax book and paper form and trying to figure out what to do.  My issue has come now that I want to efile to get my refund.  I go through the steps and when I get to efile, it tells me I have to wait for a New York state update.  Yesterday (February 4), I had a message that the update would be available \\""on or before February 5.\\""  At that point it stopped and wouldn't let me proceed.  Ok, fine, I'll wait a day.  I go in today to efile, and now I get a message saying the update will be available \\""on or before February 6.\\""  What?  It's before February 6, and why does the date keep changing?  It also tells me there will be a federal update on February 14.  So I have to wait until then to file my return????  I tried calling their customer service number but gave up after twenty minutes on hold.  I did get a message that the IRS was having technical issues with some forms (of course the education forms I'm using are part of that, my luck) and that returns using those forms would not be processed until March.  However, the H&R Block program said that I could still efile and it would be held in queue until the IRS was ready to process those returns.  So, the IRS gets to hold on to my money for a month and doesn't have to pay me interest while if I owe them I have to pay them interest from the beginning of the year.  Not fair, but the only job of the IRS is to take advantage of tax payers.  Anyway, I digress.  This update issue is very annoying, and makes me think I may go back to TurboTax next year.  I like to file as early as possible, typically February 1 when I have a refund coming, and even if I have to wait due to IRS issues at least I know I'm in the line.  Now I have to keep remembering to check the updates every day in the hope of being able to get my return efiled so I can forget about it.  So overall, it's not a bad program but these technical issues on both the IRS end and H&R Block's end are having me rethink my loyalty to this program.  However, my wallet ultimately wins and seeing as how this program is about half of the cost of TurboTax, I may have to stick with it next year as well.  Hopefully this little rant with information scattered in has helped you decide whether the program is worth it or not.<br /><br />UPDATE (February 6): After trying for about three days to contact someone at H&R Block about the issue, I finally found a web page with a chat function (you'll die waiting for someone to pick up on their telephone line).  The rep, Kassandra, told me that the business program won't be ready until the middle of February (REALLY?!?!?Then why are you selling it now) but was still trying to figure out why I couldn't file when I was using the premium portion.  I have a small business that's a partnership so I figured I would need the business portion.  I asked the rep, and she said I would need to check with a tax professional to see how I needed to file.  So what's the point of purchasing this junk then?  Her last words to me were that apparently there is another federal update coming up and that should fix the issue.  I doubt it, and it seems that I lost out the money I paid for this since, according to them, I have to have a tax professional fill out my taxes.  I really liked this program when it was TaxCut, but when they merged with H&R Block it went down the drain.  The other versions may still work for regular filers, but if you need to file for a business and want to use this particular version (At Home Premium and Business) save your money and go somewhere else.Then why are you selling it now) but was still trying to figure out why I couldn't file when I was using the premium portion.  I have a small business that's a partnership so I figured I would need the business portion.  I asked the rep, and she said I would need to check with a tax professional to see how I needed to file.  So what's the point of purchasing this junk then?  Her last words to me were that apparently there is another federal update coming up and that should fix the issue.

0,We used Turbotax for 10 years and were happy with it.  This year we spent an hour and a half doing taxes and the next day it erased all our taxes when we updated it.  Horrible product.  My husband had to spend 2 hours redoing all the taxes over again.  Serious problem with this product!
1,had pc matic for a few months.  seemed  to  help my aged computer.
0,The same day I down loaded I got a virus. What do you think. ...
1,few years ago norton was very heavy on the computers. last 2 years I came back to Norton and I really like it.
1,It was what I needed and was user friendly.
1,"The $70 to $80 seems expensive but I buy this every year because it really makes taxes so much easier then doing it by hand.  I have investments and a rental property.  First of all it pulls last years records.  You can easily compare years to help remind you if you are forgetting something. I like being able to start and stop and pick up where I left off.  Also It shows you exactly where your tax bill stands as you add deductions, or try to weigh the benefits of tallying up sales tax manually or that extra IRA contribution."
0,Many of the features do not work.  Support is not very good.  I have been trying for almost a month to get one feature working through the support.  They keep telling me to do what they told me several times before and still doesn't work.  Documentation is sparse so you can't resolve issues on your own.
1,"fast, easy, stress free as always"
1,Quick download and easy install.
1,This Anti-virus is cheap easy to use and doest interfere at all even with auto updates and my computer is working at the same speed!!! Great product!
1,I've had it for years without viruses! It's very dependable and effective! Very user-friendly. Make sure that it auto updates.
0,"Intuit is a crook for selling the Deluxe verison of TT and forcing the upgrade to Premier or beyond.  Because your TT files are not backwards compatible, you're now forced to purchase the Premier version next year.  This is dishonest. Beware!"
1,Works as advertised.
1,just GREATTTT Great Price Great Down load speed and Great Company oh did I say it was  Realy GREAT LOL
0,Too many popup notifications.
1,us it every year
0,"I've been using Quicken for Mac for years and I have to say I have never been so disappointed in an upgrade. It was a perfectly good program, I upgraded (thank heavens I can go back) and found a poor translation, of my accounts, wouldn't accept the qfx file from my bank, since it insisted on renaming my accounts. It has a showy crazy ledger, what is the matter with these software engineers, seems like it's upgrades for the sake of upgrade and $$$$. I'll be looking for another program to switch to."
1,"I'm not a Microsoft fan generally speaking, but this Office wasn't that bad, although I have some notices on the GUI, but it's a way faster than 2010"
1,"This is very effective tool to protect your PC I would recommend it to anyone out there that browses the web. It takes less than 3 min to run a full scan on my PC and has many other perks as well, such as it's ability to blacklist certain malicious websites further keeping you safe from compromising your PC."
1,Great product and great price! It downloaded and installed without issue and was exactly as what was advertised. I was able to make a correction and go back and download the 32 Bit version.
1,It just keeps getting better and better and being a student its a deal that is worth it. It helps me keep up to date with the new stuff. thank you Microsoft and amazon!!!!!
1,"Still a winner if you want to fill out your own taxes. For those with income that varies, sometimes significantly from year to year, it can be confusing in a couple of spots but all worked out after some searching."
0,"The activation key provided by Amazon did not activate this version of the software - see details below.<br /><br />I've been using Norton 360 for a few years now and I've been happy with it as a software product.<br /><br />There are a couple of less-than-ideal things about 360:<br />a) when your subscription ends the software stops working completely unlike previous versions of Norton anti-virus tools which would stop updating but would still function. Not completely unexpected, but annoying nonetheless.<br />b) the Norton pricing for subscription update is significantly higher than buying a new copy of the exact same software from Amazon, thus I bought it through Amazon which leads to a significant issue I had during install:<br /><br />The key provided by Amazon does not activate the version 6 software that I downloaded from Amazon.<br />Fortunately enough the Norton installer informed me of the software that it would activate (Norton 360 version 5) and took me to the download page. In the end there's no harm since version 5 is simply upgraded to version 6 through the program updates, but what a hassle. I don't know if that's Norton's fault or Amazon's fault, but that's pretty lame and I wasted at least an hour chasing it around.<br /><br />The long version is this: I already had Norton v6 installed (Ironically enough I had installed the software update while I was under subscription so that I could more easily make the transition to a new key. hah), so I tried to renew my already installed 360 with my new key from Amazon. It wouldn't let me do that telling me the key is not valid for this software, so I downloaded the just purchased software (ver 6) from Amazon and ran the downloaded installer. A reboot later it still wouldn't let me activate with the key from Amazon. Finally I clued in and clicked through the installer link to the Norton website and it provides me a download link to version 5. Fine, so I download version 5 from Norton, uninstall my unactivate-able version 6, reboot, install version 5, reboot, go to check for update, download the version 6 update from Norton (I didn't feel like trying to install the version 6 that I had downloaded from Amazon and figured I'd just go through the normal update process), install the update... finally done.<br />If the provided key was valid for version 6 this would have taken 5 minutes."
0,"I did not realize that this program was not any better than the last time I tried it out in 2010. Very inflexible when importing data from paypal, automatic download descriptions are uselessly truncated. My bank information automatically downloads descriptions ok, but in both accounts I have to set them at cash accounts to import .qif files, otherwise you can't get more transactions to download than what the automatic 30 - 90 days allows. The inflexible/non-existent import features (like from csv for example) is why I give this a 1 star review, and now I am stuck with this and can't return it. Beware."
1,Just what I needed. So happy
1,"Norton is the best.  I have never gotten a virus every since I started using it 11 years ago. Even when it can't immediatley identify a suspicious file, it analyzes it before it gives me access to it.  It may use a lot a memory but i have a lot on my systems and it is worth it when it protects your system."
1,Avast has always been on top of things.  They catch all of the viruses. You cant beat the price.  I will always use Avast and I will recommend it to all of my friends and family.
1,I use this every year to do my corporate taxes.
1,"For what little opportunity I have had to work in the program, it has been very helpful."
1,It's my frist time ordering from Amazon I say wow was nice to just down load it and worked smooth.
0,"I upgraded fro 2011 and have not found a significant advantage over my earlier version. The ability to use ones smart phone may be worth the expense and effort. Since at least to my knowledge, this is not available yet, save your money and wait."
0,"was not able to down load, kept repeating to do the instruction over and over again"
0,"I am one of those unsuspecting customers that buys the Deluxe version of TT at Costco as soon as it goes on sale with rebate.  I did the same thing this year.  I installed the program and downloaded the previous year tax return with no problems, just as expected.  What I did not expect, was that when I went to enter my K-1 income (I am self-employed, that's the only income I have), I was greeted with an invitation to upgrade to TT Premier!  Say what???!!!<br /><br />So I picked up the phone and called TT customer support for explanation.  I was given a line about how it's a better product now than before, how it's streamlined across different platforms, etc.  I told the lady that I am not happy about not being able to complete my tax return, and she immediately offered to make me happy by upgrading to Premier version at no cost.<br /><br />That is why I rated this product 2 stars - one for being deceptive to begin with, and one for CS effort to fix the problem.  I am tempted to tell my local Costco store to place a sign above the Deluxe version that it's not the same product as in years past.  I would also recommend to Intuit (and/or Amazon) to place warning on their site just below the name of the product:<br /><br /> DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE K-1 INCOME.  THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN REMOVED IN 2014 VERSION.  PLEASE PURCHASE PREMIER VERSION INSTEAD.<br /><br />Finally, I want to state clearly for everyone reading that I do not object to companies changing prices/features/products.  It's a free market, do what you want.  Just be upfront about it!  I will be thinking really hard this time next year whether to purchase TT Premier to complete my personal taxes, or whether to give competitor a try.  I have been using TT ever since it came out, and money is really not a big problem, it's the deception that leaves bad taste in my mouth."
1,"As described nice tools to work with photos and be creative. And easy to use with no training, just work with it."
1,"As much fun as you can have filing your taxes, this software at least makes it easy. I've been using it the last several years without problems."
1,Many changes in font from my last Quicken.  Apparently there is no way to change them and it is really al pain.
1,Have been a loyal Turbo Tax customer for at least 10 years but did not buy this year due to all the negative reviews. Switched to H&R Block and I have to say I like it much better. It is faster and easier to use vs Turbo Tax. I was apprehensive but and glad I switched.
1,I was able to import all my files from an old version and had no issues with the data. This allows me to continue using the tables and reports from the previous version.
1,"Since I don't have any complicated paperwork, I should have gone for the basic. But I tried H&R basic, it offered me with higher fed return, I hope nothing wrong with my entries. Otherwise, easy to use product."
1,"I finished my Federal and State taxes in two days, e-filed Fed and mailed state.<br /><br />Fed return posted to my bank account eight days later."
1,"It was easy to install,easy to update either manually or automatically and I haven't had any problems with a virus getting through."
1,"i bought this, as an replacement for my 2010 sketchbook.  and i did a download version which is nice.  I received a product key for later use, thank you.  This version of sketchbook is a mild improvement 2010.  I use a Yiy Nova and other products just don't work well with the Yiy Nova.  the 2010 version was good but I had upgraded my computer with no backup. Worst part i had lost the key and never renewed my subscription so i was out on able to reload the old one.  So I bought the new one and must say I was not disappointed. I recommend this product fast download and yes i saved the key this time."
1,"easy to download and install. I had upgraded from 2011 version, there are some differences, but it is manageable."
0,I was charged $19.99 for state electronic filing. The electronic filing did not work and had to mail the state return. I've emailed and tried calling Intuit to get a refund for the $19.99. Email is not returned and no person answers the phone - just wait on hold.
0,I used TaxCut for years. This year this product is too bad.  This product used to have some minor bugs. but this year it just malfunctions. First when I clicked 'Back' button sometime it actually went forward. Even worse I could not delete an item I accidentally added. Under &#34;Your Business Income&#34; I added a business and then didn't add anymore information to this item. When I clicked 'Finish' I was asked to add Schedule C. So I went back to delete this business. I couldn't! Then I clicked 'Finish' button the program completed the Fed tax return and I was led to create the state tax return! I manually filled the tax form long time ago. I use the software to do it to save my time. Unfortunately I have to delete the bad tax return file and create a new one. Now I understand why the TaxCut is cheaper than TurboTax. I am a software developer creating enterprise software. I cannot believe this product was published with so much poor quality - it looks like a prototype.
0,"I have been using Quicken for Mac for many years and have always looked forward to the new versions as they became available, trusting that the existing features would somehow be enhanced and new features added.  I worked with Quicken Essentials for about two weeks and decided to call it quits when I discovered that the software could not even calculate the principal/interest on a mortgage payment.  I found out that you have to not only calculate these amounts on your own but then enter them in the liability account entry manually.  This is a shell of a program and definitely not for those of us who are experienced Quicken users.  I'm sorry I wasted my valuable time and also my money on this adventure.  I'm returning to my old version of Quicken which suddenly looks very attractive.  Glad I kept it intact."
0,Many bugs.  Crashes frequently.  Lacks basic functionality present in prior version
1,I bought this to help me produce a program for our final choir program.  I was able to create a beautiful book that all enjoyed!  Loved the price and how you can continually buy more packages with new and different pages and clip art!  Highly recommend!
1,"It is as expected, been using for several years."
1,"I've used several AV over the years. Avast is less resource intensive. Catches some malware Norton did not, and the version I use is FREE"
0,"Quicken Deluxe 2015 is terrible.  It hangs up constantly trying to refresh data.  I kept 2012 as long as I could, then they made me up grade to this dog!  I want my money back!!!!!!"
1,"I have used the H&R Block tax software for several years, and I have always found it simple to use. The program leads you through a series of questions (which ones it asks depends on your answers), and then allows you to review and make any needed changes. The process takes ohly a short time, and then you can e-file or print and mail your return. And I have always felt like the software is exploring all possible deductions, for a maximum refund. I recommend this software highly."
1,I have only just started using a Mac.  This Office package seems right at home for me.  It's got a great blend of Mac interface smoothness with the Microsoft tried and true features.  Especially stable after I applied the updates Microsoft recently released.<br /><br />I can open and share any files my windows coworkers send or get from me.  No issues after two months of use.
1,"I have tried many security programs for my computers over the years, but for the last few years, I've used PC Matic. It's simple to use, budget friendly and I can monitor all my computers from one console. I get email alerts if any of them become infected, and each day I get a report showing that they were all scanned and are clean.<br /><br />I recommend PC Matic for your computers safety."
1,It does the same thing that I needed all of the prior versions to do: make it easy balance my checkbook.
0,"I purchased Quicken for Mac 2015 because it appeared to be enhanced to deal with past inadequacies. However, upon installing and testing the software, it still has glaring holes in functionality.<br /><br />Specifically, Quick WILL NOT permit the import of data from non-proprietary file formats. You can import data downloaded in CSV format from mint.com for bank transactions, but that doesn't deal with investments. You can connect to banks and download data in proprietary and encrypted formats. You can import entire data files in Quicken Essentials format. But you CANNOT import simple date from tab-delimited or CSV files.<br /><br />Hence, if you deal with institutions that don't pay fees to Intuit to connect via their proprietary formats, Intuit takes it out on YOU—the customer—by providing NO path for automation.<br /><br />$75 is a hefty price to pay for yet another crippled Intuit product. Since the Intuit web site states that the software is sold with a 100% money back guarantee, I will be returning this product for a full refund.<br /><br />Sadly, although there are numerous other financial software packages for Macintosh users, none of them fully meets the needs of users.<br /><br />How sad that the computer revolution which started in 1975 still hasn't matured to be able to deal with simple data import for products such as Quicken."
0,Not bad. Does what I need it to do. Didn't know there was a better version of Kaspersky in Total Security. If I would of known. Would of definitely bought that one instead!
1,"I was happy with the 2011 version but this year's version seems a little easier. It did take me a couple of minutes to learn how to find certain reports since the format changed a bit but that's no problem! I like the fact that the program operates with little or no interuption while I'm still working.  I did have a minor issue with my rebate being declined for something silly, which is not unusual these days.  But after an email and a chat online, that problem was quickly resolved to my satisfaction. I definately recommend Internet Security 2012. I currently use Windows Vista."
1,"Been in office work over 35 years.  Quickbooks Pro is the most user friendly program I've ever used and still maintains very important information, reports, etc.... Anyone can use it..."
0,I'm no PC novice. I spent 20 minutes trying to install my QB download from Amazon. No luck.<br /><br />Then I went back to my Amazon account to apply for a refund. No luck. Apparently Amazon does accept returns on downloaded software. Too bad that wasn't stated in plain sight instead of their terms of use.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in both the product and Amazon. I spend thousands of dollar on Amazon and this is going to cause me to be more conservative in my frequent purchases.
1,"This review is to provide a few of answers I initially had about the Mac downloadable version of Rosetta Stone - Spanish (Latin America) L1 - L5 and provide a couple of notes about the the technical aspect of my experience with it. If you are looking for for a review on the benefits of Rosetta Stone, others have written about them extensively<br /><br />1. It is the same version as the boxed set. I ended up with version v4 TOTALe (downloaded Jan/12) including the limited-time free online features<br />2. Yes, It allowed me to install it on two Mac machines<br />3. You are provided one activation code that unlocks all 5 levels on both machines<br /><br />The download and installation was as easy as any other program. Make sure you have broadband internet and a decently configured computer as the graphics, animation and progress sync may slow down your computer if you have an older configuration.<br /><br />Every time I turn on the application, it goes through the audio set up. In my hands, the microphone set up always fails the first time (buttons to retry audio set up also become unclickable)  and the activity slides do no appear as well. These 2 issues always resolve after I quit the application and restart it. It is a minor annoyance but it only takes me an extra minute to start the activities. Again, this might just be the computer I work on."
1,As advertised. Delivered on time.
1,Used turbotax almost from the beginning. Always my first choice. Often had it as well as my professional preparation software when in business.
1,The antivirus portion works well.  I also like the software update feature.  The only thing I don't like is the periodic badgering for an upgrade.
0,"Been using this software for many many years for both corporate and personal. Always worked fine. Now, with this Amazon download, you just don't get what is supposed to come with it. Supposed to get one free state personal efile. Guess what. NOPE. Had to pay $19.95 to get it done. And just forget trying to connect to their &#34;help&#34; chat. You can sit and wait for a while.<br /><br />Won't ever download this again."
1,"I like this becasue I am famiular with it.  Amazon, hands down, had the best price for it this year.  When purchasing renewals I always shop around Symanted's price for the same thing was almost double.  Enough said."
0,You can no longer tell the program where you want it installed.<br />They Force the Install on the C: Driver or what I call the OS Drive and that is all I install on the OS Drive THE OS. I like to install all my applications on a separate drives.<br />Knocked off One Star for no Custom Install Option and One Star for Quicken on the go mobile app.<br />One more Company moving to mobile apps and forgetting about us Desktop Non-Mobile Users!
0,"BEWARE!  TurboTax Business does NOT do your personal taxes (form 1040)!!  This is the straw that broke the camel's back and the last TurboTax product I will ever buy.    Learn form my mistake and do yourself a favor and go and purchase H&R Block's Premium & Business instead. It has everything you'll need for your business AND your personal 1040:  www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P6U8C22/    I bought Turbo Tax Business because I began a small multi-member LLC during 2014 and needed to generate a partnership return (form 1065) though we had almost no activity for the year (it will be a simple return since we just started).  I also have a single-member LLC that was began during the year also - again with almost no activity.  For that I need a 1040 schedule C which is not in this product. It wasn't until I downloaded it that I can see that I'm screwed and to stick with TurboTax I would also have to go and buy TurboTax Home & Business to do my relatively simple return.    I tried to research TurboTax Business on the TurboTax website -- I thought surely for the price versus the competition I could generate my personal 1040 using this version of the software (I like the interface experience of TurboTax more than H&R Block).  The TurboTax website compares all the forms that are available from each TuboTax product (which is nice feature compared to H&R Block) -- Except they don't list forms for the Business version (it shows Basic/Deluxe/Premier/Home & Business).  So I failed to see that the business edition does NOT include 1040 (or Schedule C) capability. Intuit really ought to include comparisons of all the forms for business and all other editions and ought to have 1040 in the business edition -- especially since their business edition is nearly twice as expensive as H&R Block's business edition that does both business and personal taxes.  Intuit's site is remiss for making such basic information clear.    The TurboTax Home & Business version (another $100 purchase) has theSchedule C that I need for a single member LLC (the $90 Premier version doesn't have Schedule C) but Home & Business version won't generate the simple 1065 partnership return for my small multi-member LLC (my wife & me).    Intuit really needs to get into the 21st century.  So many small business owners these days have gone to establishing LLC's given the limited liability protection it offers in conjunction with how easy states have made it to get established.  It only takes a few minutes online to setup an LLC and start your business.  Intuit seems to be convinced in their product feature mix that if you have a multi member LLC or small corporation that you're not a small business and don't mind shelling out $100's of dollars to do a couple simple returns.  Perhaps I'm still better off price wise compared to going to a CPA (trust me, I'm a CPA) but my future tax product purchase money is going to H&R Block -- not Intuit.    One would think after shelling out a hard earned $150 that you could use the same version to kick out my 1040. But no, Intuit wants to get it's pound and a half of flesh and make you install two separate products.  No more - I'll use the business version to generate a 1065 for my multi member LLC for 2014 -- but then I'm taking the K1 from that and purchasing H&R Block's product."
0,"ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS--slimy business from a company I trusted. Never will again.<br /><br />I installed Avast Internet Security (paid version) on a brand new computer less than a year ago. Recently started getting messages that the subscription was due to expire. I'd been fine with Avast, so renewed for 2 years ($49.99). The program reinstalled and updated.<br /><br />Next morning when I checked it, there was a message saying the firewall was turned off. The &#34;turn on / resolve&#34; buttons didn't work. I looked online for a fix, tried repair options etc, no luck.<br /><br />So I called their support. After a long runaround, what it came down to was this. They said my computer (less than a year old, very lightly used) was rife with &#34;error&#34; messages, and the firewall can't be turned on until those are eradicated. They will do this for $119 per single pop, $179 for a year service.<br /><br />To encapsule: I paid fifty bucks in good faith to continue a service I'd been receiving. Now they tell me that in order to get that service, I must pay 119-179 more.<br /><br />This is not exactly bait and switch, but along those lines. If I were an attorney, I'd be looking hard at it.<br /><br />I will add that I am a novelist, and in my book Dead Silver, I posit an afterlife realm known as Pissant Purgatory, where those who pull this kind of greasy stuff spend endless periods of time in bleak industrial cafeterias, with no sustenance but weeks-old lukewarm coffee--but by far the worst punishment is that they have no one to talk to but each other."
1,I preferred the simplicity of the old reporting system but survived taxes and am used to this.  I tried iBank for awhile but found it worse than the new Quicken to adapt to so I'm back with you.  Numbers challenge me so I need the help.
1,"I've been using Avast for over 4 years and its never let me down.  While offering solid virus protection, Avast does not negatively affect the performance of my computer.  I've only recently begun using Avast 2014, but the early indications are it's yet another solid version of the product."
1,"Great Tax program.  It's very user friendly, and electronically filing process is smooth & quick."
0,"Every time I open this program it checks for updates, then it finds them, downloads fixes like &#34;cell XX is cut off&#34; then tells me it will restart.  Except it doesn't, so there goes another 90 seconds waiting for it to re-open.  Also, it is March 21... Why are these fixes only getting applied now?  Don't you test your software before you send it out?  What happens the people who aren't procrastinators like me?  Makes me nervous to finish may tax return and turn it in before the 15th .  Also, many descriptions are very generic and don't offer much help.  I find all my answers through google.  Turbo tax's idea of help is sending you to a forum... Also, if I don't qualify for certain write off's please let me know that prior to making me enter all of my information.  there is nothing more frustrating that itemizing every expense only to be told &#34;you make too much to claim losses&#34; this is very inefficient software.  I will go with another company next time."
1,"Pros -  Free - Cant beat it, plus it lets you know automatically when new updates are available to installed software that your running on your system. The free version gives you shortcuts to update them yourself. Paid version does it for you. It automatically updates virus definitions everyday.  You can turn off the sound and pop up notices if you don't like em.  Its better than AVG in my opinion, AVG started having issues with updating, so I took the advice of my A+ instructor and went with Avast.  I'm glad I did, been using it for over 5 months with nothing but praise.<br />Cons - watch out for the extras that it tries to load on you system, never choose the &#34;automatic&#34; install, always choose the &#34;advanced&#34; so you can un-check any extra garbage."
0,2014 will not install last years returns or this years saved returns.<br />  Customer service told me to install 2013 and try again to open with 2014.  still dosen't work CS days it's me.<br />  I did my 2014 return from scratch and after saving it I was unable to open it a day later.  No matter how I try to open the saved file  the program gives me a script error every time.<br /><br />  Also each time I open HR block there exe. tries to open an unrelated program at the same time.
1,I chose this product because basic quicken is all I need.  I do not have it now because I had to purchase a new computer and have not requested a new download at this time.  Cannot evaluate.<br />I am thinking of investigating Mint.
0,It is like starting the car and you can't find your way out of the parking lot let alone follow the directions to get across town.<br /><br />Acrobat Teacher and Student version downloads fine with a 30 day period. But after that there is zero information on how to register it.<br /><br />I downloaded a digital download from Amazon.com So far so good. The only email I received is the purchase information from Amazon. In Adobe Acrobat there is no where to register or any information on how to register. The seperate pop up window when Acrobat opens is for filling in the registration code only and no links or any info about registering Teacher Student version.<br /><br />I searched the Adobe website with no luck. Other helpful Amazon reviewers say what to send in to register the Teacher Student version. But they don't say where to start the process. It's like they give the directions to drive across town but zero infomation about how the heck do you get out of the parking lot!<br /><br />I will update my review if I find a way to start the registration process or return my digital order to Amazon.
1,As expected.  Not sure what advantages there are to the earlier version other than it works with newer versions of Windows.
1,buen producto
1,This was a great purchase. I also like the fact that I am able to check for any issues and Norton will keep me up to date.
1,Always a good product and consistent
0,"I have been a long time Quicken and Quickbooks user.  After running a business on Quickbooks for the past 17-years... then selling the business and retiring; I wanted to consolidate a rental company and some minor sole proprietorships using this software.  I am very dissapointed with how difficult and non-user friendly Quicken is compared to Quickbooks.  I started using Quicken back in the 1990's and it seemed to work much better then.  I did switch to MS Money quite a while ago... I loved this program.  Then MS Money was discontinued.<br /><br />With this product I wanted to keep a family budget... but I cannot seem to separate business from personal transactions very easily.  I have no idea where I am with my budget and am challenged with managing my money with this software.  I am very familiar with accounting, book keeping and running a business; and this software is not good at any of them.  What are you people thinking at Intuit?"
1,I have used H & R and Turn Tax.  About the same in my opinion.  I usually go with the better priced program.  Have used this program last two years.  I like it and it is real easy to download and use.
1,"I love this antivirus and have used McAfee for years, bought the online code and added to 2 computers easily. I do think it should tell you where to go to redeem the code although I already knew because I have done this before, but someone who hasn't might not judging by some of the reviews, the card sent in the mail does have this info."
0,"Don't buy TurboTax.  I' ve been using TurboTax Basic for over 20 years but no more.  This year they decided to eliminate support for 1040, schedule D and other schedules that many of us use from both Basic and Deluxe.  That would require me to pay for software that was two levels higher - all the way to Premier.  That is quite a price jump.  What a rip off.  Let's teach them a lesson and stop buying their products.    If you can document that you have purchased TurboTax in 2013 or 2014, send a message to HRBlock at SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com and ask to be able to download a free copy of their software to evaluate."
0,Cost way to much to renew each year. I liked the NIS software better. I no longer use any Norton Products after over 20 years of using them.
1,"I have used Norton and Microsoft Security Essentials.  There were some applications included in Norton that I felt made my PC more secure, but there was an annual cost.  Microsoft Essentials was a program that has no charge, but at the same time did not detect any viruses, which viruses I found when I changed to AVAST free.  I had AVAST years ago with good results and am having the same experience now."
0,Actually not bad but it at times it is like having an over protective nanny.
1,Easy installation. Have not yet installed in IPad. Like that everything is combined in one.
1,I have used Turbo Tax for years but I have never bought it from Amazon so I am confused why the request for a review. Since I do not need a professional tax person I think Turbo Tax is the best thing to happen to tax preparation.
0,"The federal aspect of the program worked well, but when I did the state it said I would get back $40,400.00........ needles to say I had to do it the old fashion way and the results was far, far less than what turboTax indicated. I've used the program for years but won't buy another one!!!!!!  Actually, I want my money refunded."
1,Recommended to me by a user - I am only using the free version and have had absolutely no trouble with viruses or other interruptions.  I am using an older computer and Avast does not slow it down like some of the other programs I have used.  A great program and it says it will continue to support Windows XP
0,"Absolutely the worst Quicken version yet!!  Every month I have to search for items that have been added, deleted, or otherwise changed, before I can reconcile my accounts.  As for a time saver, this rates below zero!!"
1,"Easy to use, but ridiculous that we have a tax system that makes it necessary. Everyone needs to vote for a flat tax and a balanced budget!!!"
0,"This font pack is mislabeled. Art Nouveau is sinuous, vine like; these fonts are not. Perfectly good fonts in their own right but not Art Nouveau.

1,"I used a free download of Open Office, but it is not as user friendly as Microsoft Office.  I am now trying to get some of my Open Office files and updates on files saved in Microsoft Office where they originally began.  It works sometimes and other times not.  Also I have been unable to E-Mail from my internet and from a spreadsheet in Open Office.  However, I am still working on that little problem."
0,"I've been using Avast as my primary antivirus for years, and have had very few issues that it could not prevent or solve.  As of recent though, while the functionality may not have changed, the surrounding program has increasingly driven my urge to uninstall and find a new primary antivirus.  Where I used to be notified of scans and updates, I now get several notifications a day to do things like upgrade to pro, run their &#34;speed up&#34; tool, or rate/like/favorite/subscribe/etc, and these notifications seem to ignore my settings for the duration of the notification (which is set only to a few seconds).  Of the worst of these notifications is that they suggest I upgrade to pro to help prevent Cryptolocker and some other virus that has been popular recently, implying that non-pro users are intentionally left vulnerable.  Additionally, avast has made multiple attempts to change my browser's default search engine and home page, which I very much do not appreciate.<br /><br />The only reason I currently continue using avast is that there is no better alternative that offers important functions like active scanning and scheduled scans for free (which is an important feature for a student on a very limited income).  With that grievance out of the way, onto my experience with the function of the program.<br /><br />On most occasions, avast is plenty to keep you safe online, but I have had a couple instances where its active scanning was not enough, or the program itself was crippled by malware, so I do not suggest using only avast.  Avast is useful for active protection, but when push comes to shove, its actual scanner and removal tools are not as strong as they could be.  I personally pair avast with Malwarebytes, and the two have managed to protect me in most circumstances, and repair when early detection fails.<br /><br />In the end, a year and a half ago, I would have rated avast a solid five out of five, but the heavy handed pushing of the pro version and other unnecessary popups has served to make me fall out of love with the program, and begin a search for a less intrusive alternative.ecessary popups has served to make me fall out of love with the program, and begin a search for a less intrusive alternative."
1,works great. lets me look at different things that may need to be reported. Very easy to use.
1,"Ever since Microsoft swooped in and swallowed up McAfee Antivirus, I've switched to and continuously used Avast Antivirus (free version) which more than meets ALL of my antivirus needs. The program automatically updates itself when new virus threats are found and Avast creates protections against them. It catches all viruses as well as trojans and even brings your attention to questionable add-ons that other customers have complained about.<br /><br />Just when I thought Avast couldn't be any better, in April, 2014, after Microsoft XP announced their end of support for XP (an OS that Microsoft has stopped development and support for), Avast announced that it would not only continue support for it's customers who use XP, but that Avast would actually step up and provide support for XP for the next year, for sure, and possibly for up to the next three years.<br /><br />At the time (April 8, 2014) I had felt that Microsoft was forcing me into the new style of their Operating System, which I wanted nothing to do with. Especially in light of the fact that XP was perfect for my needs and I'd never had a single problem with XP. So why upgrade? (I felt a bit bullied by Microsoft, to be honest.)<br /><br />And then came the announcement that Avast has got it's XP-using customers covered and protected from the &#34;threats&#34; to XP security.  I was delighted. One more reason to brag on Avast Anti-virus.<br /><br />And remember, this is the FREE version of Avast that I'm talking about.  I've been renewing my Avast every year (all yearly remewals of their Antivirus program have been free as well).<br /><br />You CAN also pay for a version of Avast Antivirus that has more whistles and bells, but honestly the free version more than exceeds my computer anti-virus needs and expectations.<br /><br />It is an Exceptional product, that I Highly recommend."
1,"I cannot imagine doing one's own income taxes without this great, completely intuitive program which guides even the most novice tax preparer to quick, accurate returns.  I have used it for many years and love it!"
1,I love this program.  Very easy to use and will simplify my 2015 tax year.
0,"First off, I've used H&R Block / Tax Cut for the last few years and have been generally pleased by it. I can't say it's a lot better or worse than TurboTax... but it's been fine.<br /><br />This year, I bought the downloadable version and tried to install on Windows 8 (which the product says it is compatible with) but an installation error came up (1721) that prevents the software from installing.<br /><br />I then submit this as a problem to the support chat service at H&R block and wait the customary 45 min. before getting a customer service agent. She then proceeds to \\""review\\"" my question and tells me to go get my key-code from Amazon (which I think is just to verify that I bought it). Anyways here is the ENTIRE transcript (yes, it fits here & the names are protected... for now):<br /><br />Agent:  Hello <my name>, welcome to H&R Block At Home Live Chat Support! Please allow me a few moments to review the information you have submitted to us.<br />Agent:  Please follow these steps<br />Agent:  Open an internet window and access www.amazon.com.<br />Log into the Amazon account.<br />Hover the mouse over Your Account located in the upper right corner.<br />Agent:  Click Your Games & Software Library from the drop down<br />Agent:  Click View Product Key.<br />Agent:  The key-code will appear on the next screen.<br />Me:  okay<br />Me:  <key code><br />Agent:  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?<br />Me:  that's not the problem<br />Agent:  I would like to let you know that you may receive a short Customer Satisfaction Survey by e-mail in the next day or two. If you could take a moment to provide me with some feedback on my performance today, I would really appreciate it.<br />Agent:  Thank you for contacting H&R Block's At Home Support, <me>, and we look forward to supporting you in the future!<br />Me:  i know what the key code is<br />Me:  ??<br />Me:  Hello<br />Me:  ??<br /><br />Well, needless to say she did not understand the problem (or likely did not read my question), nor was she even looking at my responses in the chat window. Given the speed at which she closed the chat, I'm not even sure I got a real person, but if I did that is totally ridiculous. I also did not receive the customer satisfaction survey, which no one needs to guess what I would respond with.<br /><br />I guess I can go back to Turbo Tax now in perpetuity or try to get refunded for this garbage.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After another hour & getting back online again with a different representative, the problem was finally resolved. It was night & day with respect to the two customer service agents."
0,"This version lacks some features that are on the higher priced packages. But, I don't miss those features. Interface with other programs is often slow and erratic. I use the simple word processor that comes with Dragon then cut and paste into other programs as needed. The bottom line is voice recognition. It is far from perfect but still quite useful for some one with clunky fingers like me. The program will often surprise me with what it can recognize faithfully, and also surprises me with what it doesn't know or doesn't reproduce faithfully. It is a mix. I don't think the learning feature works very well. I try to train it to recognize certain words but he program often ignores me and defaults to the undesired response. For people who type very well this program may be more of an intrusion than a help."
1,Essential tool for all discerning photographers.  provides a useful and intuitive tool using language that all photographers should be familiar with.

1,"No problems, so far"
1,"I moved to PD12 after 4.5 years working with Premier Pro CS4. It would be not fair to compare $80 product with $800 product, but here is a summary of my observations after I spent  a week editing quite complicated project:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Price. You do not want to spend $240/year (current price for PP CS6) if you use it only 2-3 times a year.<br />2) Synchronization of two video clips using Audio analysis in MultiCam is amazing and helpful. Actually, I do not use MultiCam utility after that; just apply measured time shift to videoclips loaded onto regular timelines.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) PD12 does not trans-code raw files into smaller ones during loading (as Premier Pro does), i.e. during editing you browse through initial footage files that can be very large (each is ~10 GB in my case). As a result, there is sizable lag between your cursor move and PD12 reaction - unless you have the latest and greatest hardware (that costs money). An forget about instant viewing of result of your editing (especially if you entered a transition) - you have to pre-render this portion of footage first.<br />2) PD12 has a few known (and yet-to-be-known) bugs. Cyberlink tries to keep them at bay issuing patches every other month with mixed success.<br />3) In particular, PD12 does not allow to apply cross-fading for audio only: the standard audio transition \\""constant power\\"" also cross-fades video (can anybody explain why?). PD12 Forum suggested a few by-passes, but all of them require potentially dangerous 5-step manipulations with audio-tracks.<br /><br />Rendering in DVD and HD formats is easier and much more stable than in PP CS4 maybe, because PD12 provides much less options.<br /><br />To conclude, PD12 is good for small projects or for once-a-year application to big projects (this is my case). Otherwise, I would recommend to look for Premier Pro CS6.<br /><br />P.S. I did not do authorizing yet (with which is very confusing in PP CS4) and will update this review later."
0,I went with the free trial run first and after downloading found my system loaded with advertisment pop-ups. Explorer files were changes so that it kept crashing. The man in India that was customer support kept asking if my system was infected with a virus despite my repeat explanation that the problems started after downloading the AVG anti-viral program. He deferred me to unreachable tech assistants. Bad experience. Certainly would avoid this company at all costs.
1,"This program works perfectly with Fraps, and is very user friendly with YouTube. The program allows for every kind of editing. The only thing I am unsure of is how to input 3D graphics. I would love to have my video game username flash on the screen in some high qualify 4Ever animation."
1,"Been using QB since 1999. Great product. Very user friendly. When ever I have questions or problems, the customer service has been extremely helpful. I'm a small office. Use to pay a CPA over $100 per quarter to do quarterly reports, plus have to drive to his office. Now I pay an extra $100/year to QB for quarter forms/reports which just takes a few minutes to download, and then I can mail forms and/or go online and fill them out. This is much quicker and far more cost effective."
0,"Pros-<br />Works as advertised, will play your blu-ray discs<br /><br />Cons-<br />Realistically, with the existence of VLC et al., this program isn't good for anything other than blu-ray playback.<br />No Windows 8 support, even in compatibility mode and NO plans by Corel to do anything about it.<br /><br />If you have a bluray player and have no intention of upgrading to Windows 8, this program is a good budget solution to your problem. The other features are fluff that don't really add to the user experience at all--most of those features are thing your computer can already do, and do better (either natively or through free third-party programs). Corel Win DVD is a uni-tasker that is already on the way to being obsolete. Save your money."
1,"very easy to use and produced beautitul results with great graphics!  great product, with no problems found!!!  I would rrcommend!"
0,"I am a long time user of Quicken, and I have always enjoyed using the product. I upgraded from 2013 to 2015 in hopes for an improvement on the budget feature. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get past signing in, due to an error with the software: (Configuration_Error Unexpected response from Unireg. Error on your part and it will be fixed ASAP).<br /><br />With many attempts to remedy the problem, and others having the same problem online, and no answers. I decided to return the product in hopes for a better one in the future. Welcome back Quicken 2013!"
1,Program very well especially if you used it for previous year's tax. Carries over data from last year and also compares the two years to see if you have done something wrong.<br /><br />Only thing I didn't like was them trying to charge more for Schedule C.
1,So far it's been great love it and happy i got it
1,"The Accountant ToolBox is great for providing the additional accountant functions available in the Accountant version of QuickBooks.  The programmers got this one right such that once this has been unlocked for a specific company and external user, I can log out / close the company, then log back in, and my selection of unlocking the Accountant ToolBox is saved so I don't have to unlock it again!"
1,Easy to install
1,Great product and cheap.  I was able to load it with relative ease.  Very light in terms of space in  memory.  Run quietly in the background until it's needed.  Very powerful also.  It detected stuff that my Avast could not pick up.
1,"If you've used tax software in the past you know what you're getting in this package. As stated in the product information the federal e-files are included even though it's not in the software title. The download from Amazon was simple and the installation was smooth. (The key code needed to install the program is easy to obtain. It's located under \\""Your Account\\"" -> Digital Content \\""Your Games and Software Library.\\"") I was able to easily upload last year's return (as I used [[ASIN:B0047UEXP2 H&R Block At Home 2010 Deluxe Federal + State + eFile]]) and start inputing my information. There is still some ambiguity in some of the interview questions but for the most part the interview is clear.<br />Be aware that they try to upsell the \\""Premium\\"" package in this software very early. It's annoying and easily clicked away from but I can see them snagging an extra $20 fairly swiftly if someone wasn't used to using software like this. I am willing to look over this for the cheaper price tag and that I have had no troubles using it to e-file both my Federal and State taxes in recent years.<br />I commend H&R Block (and Intuit for that matter) for being much more visible on their pricing this year. The comparison chart clearly states that the state e-file is an additional $19.95. Compared to TurboTax pricing at $57 (11/28/11) + the state e-file $19.95, this is the clear price winner."
1,I  like Snagit.  I use it all the time for my business and personal applications.  It is easy to learn and use and makes creating documents or just simple email explanations so easy.
1,I have noticed for several years that you had to buy premier to do investments.  Really you whiners pull your head out of the sand.  I received a free copy of H and R Block deluxe this year.  It is so confusing I will be buying Turbotax premeir to complete my taxes.
0,wont accept activation code. worked once.
1,it is worth the money
1,I needed an Office Suite for my Windows 8.1 Laptop.  The download from Amazon was pretty straight forward.  I also received a $20.00 promotional credit from Amazon.<br /><br />Getting use to Microsoft Office 2013 is another story.  I am still learning to master the 2013 Office commands.  Sometimes I go back to my old laptop and use the 2003 Office version.
1,"I purchased the downloable version of TurboTax, because I like to get my stuff quick.  First, let me address the issue of cost.  I paid $35 for the Deluxe version.  That's cheaper than buying the software on CD from a retail store, and Amazon for that matter.  The previous reviewer makes a valid observation, that it doesn't seem to make sense that a downloadable would be more expensive than a CD.  The biggest cost for producing software like this is the design.  Once the program is written, putting it on a CD is simple.  CD's are cheap and can be reproduced quickly.  Therefore, my question would be, why is it so much more expensive to get it on a CD?  Furthermore, the cost of the software is tax deductible, so you get a little kickback there.<br />Second, the process of downloading was fairly seamless.  Amazon wanted me to download a program to facilitate downloading the software.  No complications there.  I lost my internet connection briefly during the download, but as soon as it was reestablished, the download automatically resumed.  It took several minutes on my DSL, but the executable was around 85 megabytes.  In the future, if I download any other software from Amazon, I've already got their download manager<br />Finally, the program itself works well.  In fairness, I have used only one other electronic tax program, TaxACT, which is done online.  TurboTax is easier as far as saving, and going back and forth to edit the information you put in.  TaxACT was free online, but that was when I was in college, had very little income, and no itemized deductions.  TaxACT charges a fee for doing this.  TurboTax imported my personal info from last year, which saved a few steps.  The basic edition is cheaper, but won't let you itemize deductions.  I make several charitable donations, and I have student loans, mortgage interest, and several other deductions.  NOTE: This is the Federal version only.  If you need to file state income tax, but the Federal+State version.  Otherwise, this program will want to charge you $39.95 to do the state.  I live in Texas, so there's no state income tax, so this is not an issue.  I'm also impressed with the level of online assistance that TurboTax provides, although I have not used it much.  I know there are a lot of other programs out there, like Tax Cut by H&R Block.  I had a friend that worked for HRB, and said the software is great.  I've just been using TurboTax for the last 4 years, so I stick with them.is program will want to charge you $39.95 to do the state.

1,H&R BLOCK does what I need at a very reasonable price!!  I got my taxes done quickly and it was easy.  Everyone should try it.
1,I have never had a virus issue on my computer and it only comes up when there is a legitimate issue. That what I want from an antivirus software and avast! does just that.
1,"Update worked without a hitch. It is slower than 2013. Everything seems to be in place, No loss of data."

No more updates for me, at least not with this subscription scam."
1,I love using the iPhone app with this product.
1,downloaded it and happy forever after.  Word is new improved and more than I need. I needed word and got just what I needed and a lot more.

0,"For many users the installation freezes/hangs in Windows 8.1. There is no CPU usage seen in Task Manager at all no matter how long you let the installer run. Leave it be and go to this web site http://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/patching/quicken-2015-for-windows-release-notes--updates--and-mondo-patch/GEN86565.html. Download/Run the Mondo patch and reboot when it completes running. You should be able to then start up Quicken 2015 and convert your data. Sadly Quicken continues to have abysmal programming and support (Intuit makes Adobe seem consumer friendly) but Quicken is the only program that can do whatever it does and if you have decades of financial data in Quicken, as many of us do, Intuit knows it has you by the short and curlies. Once it opens Quicken 2015 works as well/horribly as its predecessors with an interface essentially unchanged from 2014. If it tells you that your data was created using Quicken Home and Office, as it did me but I have never used that program, ignore the offer to &#34;upgrade.&#34; If you are a seasoned Quicken user you are inured to the ugly incompetence of Intuit programming. DO NOT FAIL TO BACK UP YOUR DATA PRIOR TO UPGRADING TO QUICKEN 2015 AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN REINSTALL YOUR PREVIOUS VERSION OF QUICKEN IN CASE OF DISASTER."
1,Made my life easier with those automatic calculations.
0,"Have used Quicken for many years in business and for personal checking. Now retired, I updated from 2010 to 2013 because their email indicated that if I didn't, I would no longer be able to download records from financial institutions, so I bought it. What a disaster. After conversion via download, the program worked so slowly it was barely usable. Printing a check took many minutes. The program actually changed a scheduled payee to N/A no matter how many times I corrected it. I spent many hours over several days with two very patient oversea technicians, the last of which had me delete and reinstall. I was told I could go back to 2010 program but would lose all my records dating back to 1993. After deleting all temp files and other actions to clean and speed up PC, it still gives me response problems. Don't update to this unless you enjoy being frustrated.<br /><br />2/27/13 Follow up:  As it turns out unknown to me at the time, the day I downloaded Quicken, my PC was failing. After all of the frustration, I soon discovered that all of my installed programs were now running slow. Then one day the Desktop HP PC would not run at. The bottom line is upon replacing the tower all runs smoothly now. Mea Culpa. I must change the review to 3 stars because there are still issues."

0,"I have used TurboTax Deluxe in previous years and it always had Schedule D. It does not this year and I need to upgrade to the next level for $30.00  I will not use Turbo Tax again.  This is just a way to get more money by making the \\""Deluxe\\"" like the basic.  It is a rip off."
1,I have used the H&R block software for 20+ years and am completely satisfied
1,"I used MS Money for 8 years or so till they discontinued it a few years ago and left a huge hole. I looked for a replacement at the time, and saw some Quicken reviews that turned me off. Specifically I think the product at the time didn't have balance forecasting, which I needed. I'm not sure if that was true at that time or not. So, I ended up with Moneydance. I HATED that software. I stuck with it for a few years because I though that was the best replacement there was, and had a bad first impression of Quicken. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I finally got fed up with Moneydance at the beginning of this year and looked again for a replacement.I tried a few different things but they were all worse. Finally I thought I'd give Quicken a look. It's great. It does every single thing that MS Money did. I have no complaints at all (and I'm hard to please). I admit, though that I don't use any of the phone apps, so I can't comment on that. The desktop finance stuff I love though. One thing that I really like is that in the balance forecasting, you can change the amount of an upcoming bill (or the date or whatever) just for that one instance and it will recalc everything smoothly. It will also estimate bill amounts a few different ways.<br /><br />I like the download of credit card transactions. The categories have been pretty solid most of the time and it shows you on the home page what is awaiting recategorization. Everything is pretty easy to change and obvious how to do it.<br /><br />Thanks, Quicken. You've won a customer."
1,Everything went smooth. Actived 3 computers with the code as expected.
1,This antivirus product is easy to use and updates automatically so that you do not have to worry about things getting into your system.  I would recommend this software to everyone.  Also it does do like some others interfere with your operating system.
1,"I would definitely recommend this to a friend for many reasons, such as all the new features, and the new easy to navigate menus."
1,"CorelCAD is a relabeled and repackage version of Graebert's ARES commander. The Corel version adds a couple of commands to allow exchange between the CAD software and Corel's other graphics packages. They also eliminate normal access to system variables (system variables can be accessed via Lisp functions). This is also the same software as the popular \\""Free\\"" DraftSight CAD software. Corel and Ares Commander both include Lisp functions and 3D boolean Solid functions that are missing from the Draftsight version. The Lisp functions/system exist but are very poorly (as in NOT) documented. The Corel version of the software is less expensive than the ARES commander and includes all the same functionality except for the previously mentioned access to system variables. I have personally used this software to produce Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic, Architectural and Civil Drawings as well as Graphic Illustrations.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of this software is its inability to create a \\""solid\\"" for the most basic feature used in mechanical drawings: a simple thread.<br /><br />THe next limitation is that this software can not in 3 dimensional mode \\""solid modeling\\"" render of manipulate blocks. As blocks are the PRIMARY method of managing components within a drawing file or assembly this is a MAJOR failing in the software design. That limits this package to relatively simple, small assemblies that can be rebuild from scratch when changes are needed.<br /><br />There are number of DWG compatible CAD systems on the market. This is a mid-range product far superior to lower cost offerings but not in the class of high end professional products (i.e AutoCAD, Solidworks, Solid Edge, ProE). I would rate it somewhere below BricsCAD. It is excellent for beginners and home use. It is also suitable for some commercial environments. I recommend trying the Draftsight product and then purchasing the CorelCAD software if you find that you need the additional 3D solid capabilities orLisp functionality.<br /><br />There are also some free DWG Blocks available that may be used with any of these packages. I suggest that you use a Web search engine to search for \\""CAD Library\\"". Hopefully you find Keywild CAD Library listed among the results (shameless self promotion)."
0,Very difficult to use. This is why it takes professionals to create good music.
1,"They do an awesome job of blocking threats and telling me when something might not be kosher. I have greatly appreciated this program. I had used another antivirus program in the past, but I never felt that it gave me very good protection. I have been very pleased with this product."
0,"I am writing to confirm that the fonts in QD 2014 are so unreadable that the product is useless, and to explain what an unexpectedly lousy roll-out the 2014 edition is and why.<br /><br />The fonts are either extraordinarily too small (in the accounts pane) or extraordinarily too big (in the data pane).  It also took a lot of jimmying around just to get the program to read my existing data, because the window that asks if you are updating an existing installation did not fit within the confines of my screen.  I gave QD14 two stars, partly for old-times' sake but mostly in the hope that it will improve. QD14 may work in Windows 7, and it may even work on some Win 8 PCs.  I will let those users sing its praises.  But it certainly does not work on my laptop, whereas other apps still work fine.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy QD 2014.  Not to be facetious, but you will need it!"
1,It is an excellent antivirus program. We have not had any difficulties with this program. We have been using it for several months with no difficulty.
0,I have had AVG internet sec for several years.  When renewal time I always renewed it online with no problem but I was delighted to find I could buy the same program download for $13.00 instead of the $54.99 cost required for the online renewal.  I downloaded this program two days ago and found I could no longer get my e-mail.  I called AVG support and granted the technician access to my computer.  After lots and lots of computer jargon he informed me Microsoft would fix it for $169.99.  I would explain it better if I understood it better but the best I could make of it is this:  I had Malware installed and caused installation problems so it shut down a bunch of stuff that I needed and Microsoft would have to be the one to fix it.  Needless to say I am going to uninstall the new AVG program I just bought and hope I can solve the problem.
0,"The home and business edition meet my needs and expectations performance wise. However, I thought that it was a little pricey in comparison to year's past."
1,Great value! Good packaging. Worked as expected.
1,I feel this gives me more protection than Norton did.  McAffe is the way to go!  More Virus protection than Norton 100% Guaranteed!
1,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt this was the least I could do since I use their free version. Have used it for years without a problem. I would highly recommend."
1,Software was exactly what I wanted and expected. I am very happy with it. I would recommend Microsoft Publisher 2013.
0,"Took 17 hours to download, install and it immediately tells me to downlad a newer version.  wtf.  Tell it ok, and it just freezes.  ok, fry again, this time choose install current ver.  enter key, register, then it crashes.  Open again, crashes before done loading.  repeat.  click support link, it tells me solution is...to dl another version.  eta, another 8 hours.  i have a feeling it will fail and amazon ripped me for 60 bucks.  well see tho sometime tomorrow i guess :(  UPDATE:  Nope, newer version doesn't work either.  My computer exceeds the specs.  I think it is absurd that you can't get a refund on software that fails to launch even once."
1,Just a warning that if you have earlier versions to go to the Intuit website to find out how to update the files to be compatible to Quicken Deluxe 2014!<br /><br />Had Quicken 98 and had to go through file conversion prior to being able to use that file in 2014 version.<br /><br />Do your home work!
0,"Like thousands of others I was a long time Turbo Tax customer who switched to H&R Block after I felt Turbo Tax was not clear in advertising their 2014 product.  After using H&R Block to file my 2014 tax return I can say there are pros and cons but overall I dislike H&R Block and I think they need to improve their product if they want to keep the business the gained as a result of poor marketing on the part of Turbo Tax.  Similarly, Turbo Tax can easily gain their customers back if they handle this well.<br />Pros:<br />1) I was able to load my 2014 Turbo Tax return flawlessly<br />2) The product worked in that I was able to prepare and file my return<br />3) I believe the questions they asked resulted in a higher refund for me, although I did not actually process my return in Turbo Tax to verify this.  I base my comment on the fact that H&R Block asked a question that Turbo Tax has never asked me previously.<br />Cons:<br />1) I found the software cumbersome and not nearly as user friendly as Turbo Tax.  This may be partially because I am accustomed to Turbo Tax, but even searching common deductions in their help section found no results.<br />2) TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  I simply wanted to know the cost and how to upgrade from Deluxe to Premium.  I could not find any information on doing this either on-line or within the program.  I even tried entering a bunch of bogus information trying to trigger it to prompt me to upgrade, but instead it said my return was successfully reviewed and ready to be filed when in fact it was clearly incomplete.  After searching every place I could think of, I tried on-line chat.  This was unsuccessful because it kept telling me I needed to enter my address but it didn't give me a space to enter my address.  As a last resort I called their help line.  I waited 33 minutes for a representative who could not tell me how to upgrade the deluxe version to the premium version.  She had to transfer me to another department and now 30 more minutes later I am still on hold.  I'll admit, I hate how Turbo Tax constantly prompts you to upgrade, but at least they give you the option!<br />I think the war between Turbo Tax and H&R Block is a fascinating marketing study and will probably be used as an example for years to come.  My observation is that Turbo Tax made one of the greatest marketing errors ever, but H&R Block is in no way equipped to take on their customer base, so hopefully BOTH companies will read these reviews diligently!"
1,"Didn't think I would be complimenting a MS product, but I really like the 2013 version of Word and Excel. The top menus are convenient and all the old short cut key strokes work, as far as I can tell. For someone new, it may be a little cumbersome to click back and forth between screens, if they didn't know the shortcuts. The right-click short menus make things very easy. The program has lock up a few times, which I'm not happy about, even though it tries to recover. I haven't lost any work, but its a major pain in the ASCII when you're in the middle of working on a Word doc."
0,This product does not download!!!!!!!!!I would like a refund. I have attempted a down load twice and it did not work this is not a defect in my computer.
1,had no problens
0,"Turns out this is a good product. I really thought I had a lemon for awhile because I had to download it the 2nd time before I got it to work. Once it was loaded, it worked really well."
1,bought last year forgot to renew had to buy again sucky part but hey it is very handy to have for all my work and school i need it downloaded fast and no issus at all
1,It worked well for the most part. I was able to work my way thru and complete Federal and State report. My refund was deposited in 2 weeks. I have used this program for the past 4 or 5 years.
1,AVAST is an excellent package. Freeware that is easy to use and excellent in protecting your PC. Updates are also fast and easy to apply.
1,I like turbo tax. Easy to use and it always tells me what I need to know.
0,If I cant download something I shouldn't have to pay for it- this is just crazy<br />I have never had this problem downloading through apple- don't buy this
1,"I won't buy any other virus protection software but Norton! And I have tried others (including McAfee, which I despise!) but this one is the winner! Highly recommended!"
1,"I found this program to be perfect for capturing video without severely conflicting with system frame rates.  My Windows 7 system presents video to the monitor screen at varied playback displays which is established by the authored (mp4, wmv, mov, m2t etc...) speed and size. (mbps, framerate etc)  Since SC4 can capture at 60fps and the image stays sharp. Then, I can then convert the displayed image into other formats without degrading it to fuzz.<br />Next, it will grab a frame without having to get the (write in) X,Y coordinates exactly perfect.<br />Also, it grabs the audio perfectly without getting confused about where the output is sourced, without having to mess with \\""manage audio device\\"" in the control panel.  It just does it. (great to capture just audio, it records both, but the visual screen capture can be stripped off later using a converter or video editor)"
0,"I have used TurboTax for years but after this year, I will look for something different.  For one thing, you're nickeled and dimed to death with having to buy the state returns. The only one free is one I didn't need to file in the first place as my home state doesn't collect income tax.<br /><br />On top of that, we have the special circumstances of one of us travels to other states at times for work and that cost us money with TurboTax because while my husband was in other states I was still here but Turbotax refused the dates which cost us money in refunds and extra taxes to federal though why it changed federal taxes I don't know.<br /><br />News flash, Intuit! I still lived here the entire year of 2014. I guess I don't count?"
0,"I was planning to update our home version of MS Office, but was shocked to see that with Office 2013 that I am no longer purchasing the software - I'm renting it by paying an annual license fee. I'm also not happy that I can no longer install the software on my home PC plus the two laptops that my kids use for homework unless I RENT (not purchase) the premium version of MS Office. The premium version allows the software to be installed on five PCs, but comes with features that I know won't be used at our house - like SkyDrive or MS Publisher or especially Access. What was Microsoft thinking with this new pricing strategy? Why not offer a home/student version that can be installed on multiple PCs that doesn't come with SkyDrive, MS Publisher, or Access?<br /><br />I'm a really long time PC user and MS customer. I'm generally a happy camper with Microsoft. I want to keep our computers up to date, but I just cannot get past having to pay an annual license fee or not being able to install the software on all the PCs in our home. And I don't like the option of having to RENT a product I can install right away but having to pay extra for features I don't want.<br /><br />I read in the fine print on Amazon that MS has recently adjusted their policy to allow MS Office to be installed on a different PC after 90 days, and that the most recent PC would count as the license holder. So in a 3 PC house, one of us would have to wait 6 months to upgrade. In a 5 PC house, the last PC would have to wait about a year to upgrade!<br /><br />So I decided I will hold on to my current version of Office and my current operating system as long as can. Am willing to consider alternatives to Microsoft. It was a good run, Microsoft, but it's time for me to move on."
0,"Wow.  I should have listened to the previous reviewers. This software is garbage.      Quickbooks is not intuitive, it purposefully cripples its software to make more money, it not designed with the client in mind (it is designed with shareholders in mind).  If Quickbooks didn't have the brand it does, it would fail miserably.  But since everyone is told that Quickbooks is the way to go, and they do exactly what I did and buy it, Intuit can keep churning out garbage and laughing all the way to the bank.    Alright, time for specifics.  The main thing that I wanted was the ability to import my transactions from my financial institution's online services.  I checked with a sales rep who said that it was easy, I also checked with Quickbooks online list of financial institutions that support Quickbooks.  Mine was there.  So I bought it.  Turns out that I can't automatically download my transactions because Quickbooks requires financial institutions to pay them loads of money to be able to do that. So then I realized that I could download my transactions and then import them into Quickbooks.  Nope. Again, financial institutions have to pay them money to be able to export a text QBO file.  So I can export all of my transactions to OFX, QBX, QIF and CSV formats, but Quickbooks won't accept any of those (even though 2 of the formats are Intuit formats) because they want to force financial institutions to pay them money.  I'm a programmer, building support for these file formats would be easy compared to all the other programming they do.      If you want to buy this software, make sure that you financial institution has coughed up the dough to Intuit so that they may have the pleasure of exporting transactions in a QBO format.  Oh yea, QBO is a TEXT document.  Nothing fancy, you can open it in Notepad and see all of your transactions.    Their customer support is a joke.  I haven't yet been able to get a hold of them to request a refund for this piece of trash.    Do yourself a favor and get something else.  These guys suck."
1,"Good product! Better than paying someone else to do it for you. As long as you have a return that is not complicated or complex, it is great!!!<br /><br />The only down side I have with it is it is impossible to get a human being on the phone to answer a question or something!!!"
1,"This is the 3rd version of Quicken which I have used. Only one word would describe Quicken and this is Excellent.<br />Great product to control monthly spending, budgeting and insuring check book is in balance with financial institution.<br />Also use Turbo Tax in conjunction with Quicken."
0,This product is full of bugs. Very disappointed.
0,"I could not get it to work right for me after 6 weeks , I had to go out and buy quicken rental management to get my records straight"
1,"Office is still the best and most accepted program of its type. I've really gotten to love Outlook the more I use it. Word is also a terrific program once you get past the learning curve. Excel is also very useful and user friendly. I only use these for personal use, and don't even scratch the surface of what the program is capable of, but I love the universality of it - I never recieve a file I can't read!. It is well worth the cost of the upgrade."
1,"The product is expensive compared to other products on the market. Be aware of items that can cost you significantly more money in addition to the money that you pay for this product. State returns, additional returns can cost extra. This software is installed on a computer as a program which is different than the online version that does not require software to be installed on a computer. The installed program and online version do not communicate with each other and if switching from one to the other the data entry is manually typed again.<br /><br />I will try a different product next year to see if other tax options are viable solutions and comparable."
1,"I've been using Kaspersky for about three years now with no problems, easy to install and run."
1,"As soon as I downloaded this program, after removing what 'sneaky' items that popped-up, I had much better results with working with my computer.  I purchased two other programs which I could not get to work.  ( I am a novice at these things! )  My usual repair man is on deployment in Japan, a Marine pilot, who is a genus with computers, and won't return until September.  This is the next best thing!  Thank-you, a million times!  Thanks, also, Amazing Amazon!"

I'd give negative star if I could.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the Turbotax instead."
1,I have had AVAST antivirus since I baught  my laptop and it is excellent. I would recommend it highly.....It's Free
1,The income tax system is too complex. TurboTax gets me through the filing process without having to read volumes of instructions and tax law. I never feel that I understand what I see when I review the final forms. I have trusted TurboTax to get me through the process for many years.  So far it has been as good as I could expect given the ridiculous tax system that we have.
1,"One of the editors and compositors on the market!  Easily competes with after effects and other softwares for a significantly better price!  Plus FXHome, the creators of te software put out frequent tutorials and are more in touch with the community than any other company out there"
1,After seaching far and wide could not find a better price anywhere. This is a great product and a must have application in totays world especially if you're in school. Defacto standard.
0,"Avast Premier - Tech Support is a ripoff.  You call to get help with your product and instead of helping, all they want to do is sell you more products for $179.  I have called several times and instead of helping me solve my problem they show stuff on my computer that might be an error and say your computer is not working correctly versus saying here is how we can help you.  I installed the free version and then upgraded but it continues to show that the free version expires in 30 days versus a year from now - did not help with that.  The Avast screen shows that my real time shields are off and indicates that I need to remove other software that were pre-installed with the computer like Windows Defender versus telling me how to get the shields up."
0,"I am going to write a more detailed review when I get some time but I just had to get this out there before anyone else considers buying this garbage<br /><br />* The software is geared towards ground-up design. Just forget about modeling your existing home. The ability to adjust lengths is there but completely inadequate. Moving endpoints resizes the wall, there is no way to lock in a length and move the wall.<br />* Right-click is useless! This is Windows! You right-click and you expect to see a context-sensitive dialog with useful shortcuts. Nope, not here<br />* I cannot tell you how many times I clicked a wall with the deck design tool and was prompted with 'Click a wall and drag...' dialog. Useless<br />* I cannot find a way to specify joist spacings, posts, board lengths, board direction... all things you might expect from a deck design tool...<br /><br />Honestly I could go on and on but who has the time? This piece-of-$#!* has already taken enough of mine. I wish I knew something else to recommend but I can say pass on this and I feel pretty confident that the other Punch products are just more of the same."
1,What I really wish is that people would write reviews based on the functionality of the product and then inject their personal diatribe regarding price as a postscript. With regard to tax prep price the $200 or so it will cost me to buy software for my tax prep this year is nothing compared to the almost $2K it cost us in CPA fees to file our S Corp Fed+ State & personal taxes last year!! I have used TurboTax software in the past and have had no issues and will be attempting our corporate return(s) for the first time this year using our professionally prepared returns from 2013 as a guide. Intuit money grabbing aside their prices are FAR LESS expensive than having your business + personal taxes prepped professionally. Just my 2 cents.

0,"I would have given them 4 stars but given the data breach that happened and my daughters social security number was used I am very dissasatisfied.  I tried to get ahold of customer service at turbo tax and was put on hold for 2 1/2 hours, transferred to 3 different departments and was disconnected.  So frustrated!  Their customer service sucks!"

1,I'm no expert on computer security but Norton has worked nicely for me over the years.  I like having three licenses for the various computers I own.  The download through Amazon is easy; I can access it long after my original purchase.  All good.
1,"I waited as long as I possibly could to upgrade my Office XP Pro suite. I waited until literally forced to by my job. And I'm kind of sorry I waited now! I thought it would be un-intuitive, an opinion I gleaned from looking over someone else's shoulder who was using it, but it's not. It IS different, and some settings I use frequently are in different places, but I'm learning that they aren't bad or nonsensical places, just different than what I'm used to. I like the more web-like interface, it flows with how much time I spend on the internet these days, and feels much like another web application.<br /><br />I like how customizable it is, seems to have more options that I can shortcut to how I do my documents. I use Word A LOT. Every single day for several hours as I work at home as a transcriptionist. So I really get to know Word. There were no hiccups using my old .doc format templates in Word 2010, and it was easy to convert them.<br /><br />I also use Excel almost every day and I haven't noticed huge changes in it yet, which is good. It has the same web feeling to it now.<br /><br />I haven't had need to use the other programs in the suite yet, but I am impressed so far with Office 2010, and glad I no longer have to worry about plug-ins and converting newer file types to my old suite. If you, too, are holding out, don't!"

1,I love using QuickBooks Online Essentials. I can use it from anywhere!
1,have used this for years
0,"I have purchased this product to file the taxes for my elderly Mother's trust for the past 2 years. Each year it has allowed me to create mistakes in the proper forms to use and to carry those mistakes onto future years.  Major blunders in fact.  Their support staff was quite nice one year but vain, arrogant and too overworked to be of any value the next.  And they never could understand the problem and left it for me to figure it out myself.  They begin with their own mantra and mindset is that Turbotax is never wrong. The step by step instructions are poor and vague and unlike the user friendly Turbotax that you may be use to for your personal income tax.  So expect to find this product is poor and not given much attention since it has far fewer users. Regardless of their claim, they have not allowed E filing of Federal trust returns and only stick you with that fact after you own the product. Buyer beware!  I find this enormously overpriced for the few forms that were necessary to file a trust return."
1,"QB Delux does everything I need it to, almost automatically. I started with 2010 and keep going. Great accounting program."
1,"This has been the only program that keeps me focuses and motivated. The classrooms guide you and keeps you on track. The Rosetta World is interactive and fun. Great games, short stories and chat sessions with other students. Definity worth it for someone who wants to put the time and effort to learn the language."
1,"Basically it's the bast program on the market.  However , they ask a few questions without a good explanation.  Their customer service is excellent."
1,Excellent product. Unfortunately it cannot be supplied outside of the US. European customers like me have to be &#34;creative&#34; to get it. But as they say: if there is a will one can find a way.
0,"I used Quicken 2007 for a year or two and was not very happy with the product... I decided to give Quicken Rental Property Manager 2012 a shot in hopes the product had been improved... I like the idea of having all my financial information in one place, being able to generate reports etc.<br /><br />Since I gave up on Quicken back in 2007-2008, I have been using Excell spreedsheats to keep track of income and expenses, especially for my rental properties. This is a lot of work. Thus I'd like to automate the process as much as possible... and thought a newer version of Quicken would be an improvement (over my Excell Spreeadsheets)... I bought a book on Quicken together with the product... read it... and I also contacted the Intuit support line probably 10-20 times... but have finally decided to give up on Quicken again.<br /><br />The issue is there are a lot of things Quicken doesn't do... you end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to do things... just to realize it is not possible... just be told by the support line you you have to do manual edits... I don't need Quicken to do manual edits... my Excell spreadsheet works just fine in that sense...<br /><br />If your finacial situation is straight forward then Quicken works just fine... but then you don't need Quicken... most banks offer quite a few features online now, e.g. Wells Fargo Billpay...<br /><br />Here are some of the shortcomings I encountered:<br /> * Quicken does not support eBills which means you manually have to enter the amount to be paid unless it is a fixed amount (e.g. WF Billpay does this automatically for you)... the whole idea is to get the software to do some of the work for you... not to make it more troublesome...<br /> * There is no way to link a liability account (e.g. mortgage) to a downloaded payment which means you manually have to split the downloaded payment into interest (tax deductible) and principal (not tax deductible)... and you have to manually decrease your liability account by the principal portion of your payment... now if you use Quicken to schedule your payments then this is not an issue but then you have to deal with the first bullet (unless you want to use your bank's webpage to pay some of your bills and you schedule other bills via Quicken... messy)...<br /> * Let's say you have used one property as collateral for a mortage you used to pay for a couple of other properties... tax-wise this mortgage now has to be split (into at least four portions than vary from month to month)... in this case you have to manually split the payment every month (even if the payent is scheduled by Quicken)...<br /><br />And the list goes on like that... I do realize not everybody on planet earth has a complex situation like this... but why do you need Quicken then? WF online features or mint.com (also owned by Intuit) work just fine then..."

0,"I have been an avid quicken user for over a decade. With each new upgrade, there are always some growing pains and a learning curve. But, with this newest edition and the mobile app, even after owning the product for 2 months I am still having issues with the desktop version. And the mobile app is useless. The main problem I am having with the desktop version is it's failure to download transactions from my bank. I have several accounts at one bank, and the program fails to communicate with this bank to download transactions. One day it will be working just fine, and the next, the program thinks that this account isn't at the bank and suggests I remove it from one-step update. I have deactivated and reactivated one-step update so many times, it is almost comical.<br /><br />Now for the mobile app. Useless. Waste of disk space. The mobile app doesn't do anything I need it to do. First of all it gives only gives you your online balance (which I can get more quickly from my own bank's app) or your ending balance. Not what your balance is today. (For example, I enter all my bills into my register at the beginning of the month, dated to the day they actually get paid, so they are technically, \\""pending\\"" transactions. This way, I can see if I am going to run out of cash before the next pay day.) The mobile app doesn't give you your balance on any given day, and it doesn't give you your daily balance like it does on the desktop version. The other issue, is it's failure to allow you to edit a split transaction if it was entered on the desktop. You can't transfer money between accounts on the mobile version. If you enter a transaction in the mobile app, the desktop version treats it as a downloaded transaction from a bank. Then, when you try to reconcile, you have to unclear the transaction in order for it to balance.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, stay with the older version until they fix this fiasco."
0,Serial Number Validation<br />&#34;Please connect to the internet to validate your serial number&#34;<br /><br />I click &#34;Validate&#34; and I am online but it still doesn't connect so I can't even use the program.<br /><br />Waste of money. Worthless.
1,"Quickbooks Essentials makes it so much easier to manage billing, I wish I had made the leap years ago.  I care about the look of my invoices, and Quickbooks invoices are flexible enough that I have been able to customize them to suit my business.  I can access my books from home, work, or via devices. It's so convenient, I keep up to date as I never did before."
0,"Very disappointed.  There is a problem with the VT Form IN-111 (use tax).  According to your website it was fixed with the 3/30 download.  I have updated my program a couple of times, and it still isn't fixed.  It tells me line 27 should be zero, but it doesn't let me change it to zero.  I usually file my taxes in February, but I still don't have my state taxes filed because of this error, and I'm running out of time.  I have used Turbo Tax for several years, but with the stolen refunds and this problem I will probably switch to something else next year."
0,"I purchased the map code today (5.2.10), and have tried several times to download the map update from Garmin's web site. I have an account on the Garmin site, and I'm able to update the firmware and voices on my Garmin. Each time I try to update the maps (using Safari Mac), I get the following message: \\""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again. If difficulties persist,\\"". I've emailed Garmin support for help. I'll update this review when I get a response, but for now, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you can accept the risk of the update not working. Code still not working at 8AM 05/03/10."
1,"I am a firm believer of Turbo Tax... I have used it for about 15 years. I do wonder, though, how they can continue to advertise that total cost to efile both federal and state is 0, when I have to pay $19.95 to efile my state return. My only complaint is that their help menu sends you to a forum of other users for their answers or opinions, rather than direct to the Turbo Tax experts."
0,Unable to download!
1,I was very pleased with this purchase.  Now I have to wait a lifetime to make sure the deal is as sweet as it seems!
0,"I have been using Quicken for more than 10 years. I was looking for an alternative and there is simply no good money management software out there. I stick with Quicken because I don't want to learn another program.<br />It took forever for Quicken to update itself. I simply just ignored the installation window and started playing PC game. I don't think I have a slow PC or internet connection.<br />This new version seems to be able to connect to my bank. The last one doesn't. However, I found a few duplicate transactions without any reasons. It took me a few minutes to manually reconcile those transactions.<br />Quicken is not perfect. I just like it better than using a spreadsheet."
0,"UPDATE 2013/04/04 (April)  I did finally get it to work.  It seems like it's going to be useful and maybe even fun but I've only had it up and running about a day and a half.  It took many hours over several days...trial and error mostly...to figure out what PowerDirector did not remove in the uninstall so it could actually start out fresh.  As I've had to do with quirky software in the past, I had to search the hard drive for any folders or files that might remain after uninstalling.  Then, I search the Windowws Registry to find things of the same ilk and I try deleting them.  Of course, before starting the process, I have to image my OS partition to be prepared in case I massacre the OS files to the point of no return.  I don't know which \\""delete\\"" made the magic because I did multiple things at once...however...it now will launch and run.<br /><br />Cyberlink did finally respond with human (rather than bot) intervention.  However, they want me to send screenshots, dxdiag logs, and a whole bunch of other stuff so they can analyze.  Well.  I'm up and running on my own so I'm going to politely decline their offer.  If they had asked for that a few days ago I might have done it but I don't know that would have helped any.  I think it would have just been more busy work designed to keep me offline and out of their way.  We now know the fix was deleting stuff.  Tech support will never advise you to delete stuff from the registry.  They know 90% of their customers can't do that.<br /><br />So, the basic install works.  But, in addition, there are some additional \\""content\\"" installers that are part of the Ultra package. One is a separate 1.7 Gig installer called \\""essentials\\"" and then there's a 0.9 Gig installer that is called \\""premium\\"".  I haven't had the nerve yet to try them although I want to because I guess that's where the snazzy transititions and effects are harbored.  I'm just not ready for more installation problems right now.  Maybe some day after I've had a few martinis I'll be ready to do the deed.<br /><br />Oh, and get this.  The update/patch files at Cyberlink carry a payload.  Oh, yes.  It's true.  You have to carefully decline a Google installer when you run an update.  How about that?  You're in trouble so you run to get a patch to fix broken software and they slip a Google thing in there.  Really?  Is that they way to do it?<br /><br />UPDATE 2013/03/30:  It did take 12 hours to download from Amazon. So, consider the \\""download\\"" option to be similar to a \\""next day\\"" delivery.  I still cannot use the program.  It did nothing but crash so I tried the uninstall/reinstall routine but now it won't launch as it complains that it is cannot find MFC90U.dll.  (Of course, that's a part of Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 runtime and CyberLink installs that runtime as part of its install routine.)  When I contact CyberLink support through email, they only regurgitate and reflect my statements back to me or they answer a question that I did not ask.  It's as if they have a bot program autoresponding and I think that is the case.  CyberLink support is of no help whatsoever but I must continue to hammer away at them hoping I'll eventually land upon someone or something that knows something and is willing to share because Amazon does not accept returns of downloaded software.  And, of course, I'm Googling like crazy trying to find a fix.  If I figure something out, I'll come back to post.  I suspect others will experience this problem.  In the meantime, my $58 for the software has only left me with a big obstacle to overcome so I can troubleshoot CyberLink's software for them.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW POST:<br />It will take over 10 hours to download this from Amazon's server.  Something is very, very slow.  Web page for CPD11Ultra says it's 654 MB but when you fire up the Amazon download manager to get it, you discover it is actually over 3 Gigs.  That would be okay because I've got a good fast fiber optic connection but something isdragging the bits through sludgy mud before they get in the stream.  The server is doling out the bits so that over 4 hours have passed and I've only got about 1.2 Gigs of the total 3.21 Gigs. The Amazon download manager says there's another 8 hours to go!  It's going to be 12 hours waiting for this application.  Adding to the anxiety, however, is the expectation that the installer will fail because some bits are whacked and I'll have to restart a 12 hour download again.  I'm pretty sure this will make me shy away from Amazon's other download services (movies, software, games, etc.)  I called Amazon customer service.  They could see what I was trying to download but said they couldn't do anything to speed it up.  So, here I sit.  4 hours down and another 8 hours to go but I'll be in bed by then!<br /><br />2013/03/30 ELABORATION ON TODAY'S UPDATE<br />I still can't use the program.  It did nothing but crash when I tried to encode a short movie time line.  Naturally, the next intervention was to uninstall and reinstall.  Tried that.  Now, I can't launch the program.  It complains that it cannot find mfc90u.dll.  Turns out that's a Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 file.  Cyberlink PowerDirector installs an old version of M$ Visual C++ 2008 during the PowerDirector installation process.  So, why can't PowerDirector find its own files?  I think that's a question that CyberLink should easily be able to answer.<br /><br />I believe my download from Amazon was intact because the Amazon download manager utility ran a MD5 hash check on the files and it reported that all was okay.<br /><br />It's frustrating when I consider that CyberLink has sold thousands of software packages.  You know that my problem cannot be unique.  It must have happened to many.  And, yet, when I contact the people who coded the software, all they tell me is a repeat of the things I say in my email query.  I tell them I have already installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled.  Their answer is to uninstall andreinstall.  Do they think that just because they say it then it will be effective even though I have already done that?<br /><br />Obviously, the CyberLink uninstall/reinstall routine is flawed.  That's why it can't find the Microsoft C++ 2008 runtime that CyberLink put there.  So, what good does it do to tell me to do that over and over?  If it failed, then it will continue to fail.  Only CyberLink coders can determine why that is so.  But, the problem won't get past the CyberLink bots!  The bots just keep saying uninstall/reinstall!!!"
1,"This software is what I needed. It might not be for everyone. My needs for this are not that complicated, so for me this is good. It mught even be more than I needed."
0,"I've used this software for years, back to the \\""TaxCut\\"" days, and have had few problems with it. This year, it's impossible to file a self-employed return that properly accounts for ACA healthcare premiums. Even relatively \\""low-end\\"" TaxAct managed to work in the calculation, but HRB apparently put off the update until late March and then decided they can't fix it after all.  So I ended up re-entering all my info into TaxAct (does alright, but relatively paltry 1099 import, and springs a $20 state fee on you near the end). It looks like some customers of HRB were told they'd get a refund for the program, but I doubt that will apply to Amazon. Very disappointed, and will think twice before buying software like this on Amazon again."

1,"I love Avast.  It updates itself on a regular basis, and tells me when I am secure and when I'm not."
1,"TurboTax is great.. Amazon provided downloads and that is fantastic- it went flawlessly.<br />For those in a rush, it is the best thing to use, rather than waiting in the mail for a CD.<br /><br />If you're hesistant about doing your own taxes and still need help, there is a paid-for tax specialist that Turbo Tax provides in an affordable on-call service- once you're ready to submit.  They are even present off-season and very courteous.  Highly recommended.  You send your questions-- they research your answers prior to the call-- and provide you maximum inputs, trying to  save you as much time as possible.  Very professionally researched answers.<br /><br />In short, Turbotax is a great software with the bonus of additional help service in case you get stuck, which is its hidden fantastic feature."
1,"Like many of you, I have been using both TurboTax and H&R Block at home (formerly TaxCut) for several years. I would say both software are good with no problem. The only factor to me is the price. I chose H&R at home Deluxe+State 2011 at $1X.XX and Deluxe+State at $2X.XX, only because TurboTax could not beat the price. That's it."
0,Microsoft keeps making products that are getting worse every year.
1,"Painless 10-11 minute upgrade from Win7 Home Premium(x64) to Professional.    A few of my XP applications did not play nicely in Win7 environment and the Compatibility Tab in the Properties Window did not cut it either.    So....it was necessary to run WindowsXP as a Guest OS on a virtual machine on the Host Win7. And for this the Professional version is needed.    The WinXP mode(virtual machine) is nicely integrated into the host Win7 and it is possible to run an application from a host Win7 desktop icon without being all that aware it is running in the guest OS. So now I can use most, not all, of my legacy apps in Win7."

1,The pricing on this product was very good and I loved being able to download it immediately.  I would order from this vendor again.
1,This is by far the easiest antivirus software I have ever used. It alerts me to everything. I love this software.
0,I'm not at all impressed with this software....compiling a pdf document from multiple pdf files is a joke. This software adds all kinds of strange marking and characters to existing pdf documents and renders them basically useless. Will probably try to get a refund for this product. Even the user interface is awkward and clunky to use.
1,Best release in the last 5 years.  Works great on Windows 7.  Previous releases gave me trouble and I could   only backup up my data while in SAFE MODE.
1,good deal for its price. works perfectly
1,"It worked, but I had to put the destination drive into my laptop in order for it to boot properly.  I suppose I could have spent a few minutes figuring out how to get it to work, but I simply did not have the time.After I did that, I had no issues with the transfer.  Worked great!"
0,"THANK GOD I read before I purchased. The fragmented operation of 2014 was clue enough to at least make me read before purchasing 2015.

0,ok
0,"Like everyone else after using TT for many years I refused to be gouged.  Even the offer of $25 was not enough to make me come back.  I switched to H&R Block, and had no trouble transferring my 2013 info.  Who was the greedy exec at TT that decided to try to pull off this scam?  Can he still work there?  This had to cost them many times more then the price increase netted them.  As they say &#34;Pigs get Fat, and Hogs get Slaughtered&#34;.  TT had to be a Hog, not satisfied with the good thing they had."
0,"I purchased the MS Office 2011 Family pack because my parents made a (joyous?) move to the mac and I have finally needed to upgrade 2004.  I purchased the digital version and after some tinkering and registration hurdles finally licensed 2011 on two machines...<br /><br />First of, if you have used 2007 or 2010, IMHO the mac version pales in comparison.  It is a weird mutation between 2004/older version of Office for the MAC and the windows 2011.  The UI feels more slapped together than designed for users. Not a fun experience especially now when so many companies to improve your user experience to get to LOVE to use the app (look at snapseed on the iPAD for a good example.)<br /><br />Secondly - and this is the reason for my 1 star rating - the autodownload patches from April 2012 contained some sort of the bug that now precludes office from starting on my machines.  It shows Office as licensed but asks me to license the software and shuts down. Microsoft admitted to some service pack SNAFU but from what I can their latest update still doesnt address the issue.  Basically at this time I cant use the software (I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that didnt help either - there must be some errant file elsewhere that I cant find and frankly dont have time to look for.) Needless to say this really upset me.<br /><br />Since this issue I have downloaded LibreOffice (its a free well supported version of OpenOffice) and havent looked back. I just wish I didnt spend the money on this piece of crap. Shame on Microsoft."

1,Really easy to use
1,"I'm always getting confused between the different languages I know just enough of to get by. Is that the Spanish word for it? The French word? I also knew no Italian, but thought it wouldn't be that hard if I knew French and Spanish. Well, I was wrong. :-) Really glad I purchased this and used it. Signed up immediately for the web-based training, and found the time with the online tutor VERY helpful! Also found the pronunciation guides very helpful. You can click through to see the sound wave comparison between how you're saying it versus how it should be said, so if you want to invest the time, you can set the sensitivity to speak far more like a native.<br /><br />Only thing is you can't rely on this to teach you 'the rules'. So if you learn some of it, you're still pretty dependent upon the program to learn more. They don't teach you how to conjugate the different verb types, which are irregulars, etc. I spent a few dollars on a couple of one-pager type pocket guides to show that, and we are off and running. Just wish I had been able to spend more time really getting through the last few lessons before we left."
1,I love this program alot. you can download a trial for 30 days from the companies website and figure out if standard or pro is right. I picked pro for my business because ocr was alot better but standard is ok for other things.
1,"I am no stranger to photography or design software, but this program teaches me something new EVERYDAY! If you can think of it, PS can do it. Well worth the investment for the professional and the semi pro alike. I don't know that I would recommend this to the average user. Only because it is does SO MUCH more than the average user typically needs or wants to do. However, if you're the courageous, adventurous type, and want to spend some money, go for it. I don't think you'll be unsatisfied. Just be ready for a learning curve. It will take awhile to get use to the program and become proficient."
1,Great product made even better by a deeply discouted price.  Automatically updates its virus protection files.  Seamlessly integrates with operating software.

0,I downloaded this and it caused a lot of issues for my Mac. I ended up removing the files.
0,"I have been using QuickBooks for over 10 years, and this is by far the WORST edition that I have had. This software is riddled with bugs, and I cannot recommend anyone purchase 2015 until it has some serious fixes. Sadly, I have not seen many fixes come out of Intuit, and the Intuit support site is VERY difficult to use.<br />Some of the functionality has changed for the worse. Notes used to be very simple to add, but now you have to take a couple extra steps just to view and enter notes. They tried to make it a quick reference by having a &#34;pin&#34; board for notes, but you cannot edit from there, and it defaults to unpinned.<br />When you are viewing &#34;all customers&#34; and you go to edit new or old, the system loses all inactive customers. It's incredibly annoying! You will find yourself at the bottom of your customer list multiple times a day. BUGGY BUGGY BUGGY. Intuit has to have known these bugs were out there, and they rolled this software out anyway. If they don't fix some of the really big bugs soon, we will begin to explore alternative accounting software options."
1,great way to at a reasonable price
0,I would recommend not purchasing this product.  I was unable to activate it after trying 20 plus times.  I actually unistalled it due to the issues.  There is no easy way to get the activation error corrected.
0,I do not recommend this product. It shut down my backlit keyboard and is overrated for what it provides. It filled my screen with Star8 icons and was a flat disappointment. A waste.
0,very very basic .. should have spent twice the money for a better product
0,"Avast is like a worm inside your computer that's hard to get rid of.  What don't I like?? Constant pop ups on a daily basis, sometimes, several times a day.  Did you buy and pay for 2 computers?

1,"If you're seeing this in the under 30 range, I'll tell you that this is a great value for what comes in the package.  Even moreso than the latest version.  First off the download code for Sony Loop Collections is worth more than the whole package.  The code is value for all loops from Standard to Premium so it's a no brainer to buy this and get a Premium set.<br /><br />As for the software, it's a great concept to be able to paint the areas on the tracks where you want your loops to play.  Added to that, you can compose using MIDI tracks and also use the built in chopper to cut your own loops.<br /><br />It's not the best DAW overall but for laying down beat tracks, it's very tough to beat!"

0,"I have been using TurboTax since it was introduced (formerly Parson's Tax Edge).  It has worked reasonably well until this year.  I started my taxes today and the software has crashed at least 20 times so far.  Any \\""link\\"" that is selected immediately crashes the program.  I had to save my work every page.  I completed a preliminary return and wanted to print it.  Now it crashes when I select Print Center.  So I cannot even see my return to review it.<br /><br />I am running Win 7 64 bit, Intel i7 processor.  Chatted with support after a 35 minute wait.  Then told I was at wrong department.  Waited 35 minutes after the offshore agent transferred me.  Told I was at wrong department.  Transfered again and after 45 minutes, I gave up.  I called and after waiting 35 minutes on hold, I was told that I needed a different department. After hold message said 45 minute wait, I hung up.<br /><br />Now I need to switch software packages.  No more TurboTax.  Intuit's QC has gone to 0.  I upgraded my Quicken this year and have had nothing but errors.  Most split items become duplicated at least once every time they are accessed.<br /><br />I would appreciate any suggestions for alternate software...

She helped me quite a bit and we had a nice conversation about the software.  She sent me a link to download the software (I had originally purchased a box version from Amazon).  I installed it and so far have not had any issues.  If I do have any problems or crashes, I'll update this review.  I am changing my rating to 3 stars for the time being."
0,"I tried, but it didn't meet my needs.  I have 3 albums of songs recorded on a zoom mrs-8 with parallel sequences done with cakewalk express.  It read the midi files all right, but when I tried to add the audio tracks from the zoom, it automatically adjusted the tempo of the audio tracks, which, since it was already at the right tempo, caused it to be off.  After a week of trying every option I could find, I gave up and bought cakewalk sonar x3, which handled the job without a problem.  If I were starting from scratch, ACID would have been a good choice.  It is easy to use and the mixer has a lot of headroom on each track and produces a good sound."
1,I have had other security programs and I would not get them again.  Norton 360 is the best.  They never kick you out of your program when running checks.  The others do kick you out of programs and you have to start over.  Not with Norton.

0,"Intuit has again released a newer version of it's Quicken software that pales in comparison to Mint.com, whom they smartly acquired several years ago.  This \\""latest\\"" release has the same problems, connectivity and usability issues Quicken 2012 had.<br /><br />Buyer Beware: Amazon defers to Intuit for refunds.  I've waited nearly two weeks after starting the process.  Here's my experiences:<br />1. No email from ereturns@intuit.com as to receiving my email (as a result, no tracking information at all).<br />2. No informed help from Intuit's support options.<br /><br />I called the provided number and was told that all communication is now handled through the forums based support website.  After posting my question regarding my refund in the area specified to report these issues, I was told to contact their Chat Service by a Quicken Forum Administrator (who provided a link).  After contacting the Chat \\""Specialist\\"", I was told that as long as I submitted the required paperwork, everything would be fine.  I pressed that there was no tracking information and no reply on the request.  I specifically asked for further information regarding this.  The specialist eventually forwarded the chat log to her supervisor.  In that chat log, I again provided a copy of my receipt from Amazon and the email from Amazon stating who to contact.  A day later, I received contact from another supervisor stating that they needed more time to review the status of my refund.  The following morning, I'm asked to AGAIN provide a copy of my receipt.  The entire situation smelled of a smattering of outsourced and untrained \\""specialists\\"" who were scurrying around for answers.

1,"This was the first time that I had ever prepared my own taxes without enlisting the service of a professional.  I was pretty nervous at first, however, H&R Block's software was very easy to use.  The user interface was minimal and intuitive making it very simple to follow and use.  I used it for both state and federal taxes and couldn't have been happier.  Lastly, this software license allows you to file up to 5 tax returns for no additional charge, which is convenient if you have any family members that are interested in using it as well.  I highly recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />As a side-note, after I eFiled my Federal Tax Return, I received a direct deposit from the IRS in less than 1 week."

I'm using this to create basic screen captures, things like scrolling shots of web pages, etc. Previously I was using CamStudio (free screen capture), but I couldn't get smooth scrolls. With Movavi, I get smooth page scrolls no problem.<br /><br />If you are unsure, I would recommend you do what I did and download a trial version (can be downloaded from their website). This gives you a 7 day free trial. The video's you create during the trial period are watermarked, so this is truly a free trial. If the program works to your liking, you can them return to Amazon to purchase the software. After purchasing, Amazon provides you with the product key to activate the software already installed on your computer, so you don't have to download the program again. This is a great feature, not to mention the pricing is better from Amazon.<br /><br />I haven't used all of the features yet of the program, but will update my review at a later date after exploring more of it's capabilities.  I didn't want a full blown editing suite, like Cam Studio ($299), etc., since I already use the Adobe Suite. I only need a screen capture program without the editor. This seems to be the best solution that I have seen so far that is affordable, a small program, doesn't have more than I need, and can produce smooth video of page scrolls."
1,This is the fifth year I have used TurboTax and I really like it even though I sometimes have to go the long way around to get it to do exactly what I want.  It's great if your business is common and straight forward but it doesn't accommodate the out of the ordinary.  But i like it enough to keep using.
0,"First of all the downloaded version from Amazon did not work with their key unless I called Intuit to get a new key and for them to make additional changes to their server to accept the new key.  Second, when I tried to add my purchases and bills in the appropriate accounting section, I was directed to pay $29/month in addition to what I already paid.  Finally, Intuit had no procedure to give me my money back.  All I could do is mail a letter to their returns department and hope they would respond to this.  It has been 3 weeks and I still haven't been reimbursed.  I will probably have to ask Amazon for my money back because Intuit is incapable of handling this."
1,"Works as expected, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product"
1,Very good  protection at a very reasonable price.
1,"This program does exactly what I was looking for in a writing program without having to pay a high price for it.  It is easy to navigate and work with,  I would recommend it for home use."
1,"excellent program, very useful."
1,Very easy to use
1,"I am pleased with Norton Security (for 5 devices) download. I wanted to try a different virus scanner on my MacBook and on my PC, so I started with Kaspersky last year and after a few days switched back to Norton. This year I started with Webroot on my Mac and PC but was not pleased with it. Although Webroot got great reviews, I did not like the speed of it; It was too fast, it did not scan all the programs and it probably would miss a virus. I could be wrong but that's my belief. I decided to download Norton security for 5 devices from Amazon. The down load was without difficulty. I went to Norton.com and downloaded the trial version of Norton security. I was careful to download the version that I purchased from Amazon. There is Norton Security that replaced Norton 360 and Norton Security with backup. I signed into my Norton account and downloaded Norton Security trial version. I then entered the downloaded code I received from Amazon, in Norton Security trial version. The section to enter the code is on the left side, at the bottom of the program. I did not use the trial version. The program downloaded and I followed the instructions to customize the program, check for updates and scan my computers. The amount of days left is noted at the bottom of the program. When scanning is completed the amount of programs scanned, the amounts of threats and tracking cookies eleminated are noted. The program is running well and I am happy with my purchase."
0,"I was so excited to download the latest version thinking certainly that they would have fixed the problems associated with downloading the transaction files. I was wrong. It worked great the first time I did it. Then, the next day and the day after and the day after that I got tired of having it pretend to download transactions and not update the files--it didn't even give me an error message that the transactions had not been downloaded. I tried importing files and every other option to fix it that I possibly could having researched it and the only \\""fix\\"" is to keep creating new accounts...what a TOTAL WASTE of money and time. Part of the draw of Quicken for me was that it would automatically download my files and it is a total headache trying to manipulate it only to not have it work then invest more time manually entering all the transactions. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers and realized if it could happen to them it could happen to me-for some reason I thought that with my computer savy the difficulties wouldn't happen to me but they did. Don't waste your money."
0,This does not include Schedule D this year. I am returning this and starting H&R Block this year. I have been using TT since 1996.
0,1. No way to translate board feet into quantity of boards. It just gives the total footage and forces you to manually count the boards.<br />2. Has an odd way of snapping to components.<br />3. 3D camera views are very helpful for manually counting boards.
0,"I would give this purchase a 5 if I did not receive so much malware after downloading this product. Had to Install malware protection product after downloading this, ended up saving me no money in the long run. Need better protection for downloads."
1,"It was a totally smooth and uneventful experience: after a few motions I left my two PCs at work with Laplink overnight and by the morning's dawn everything was in order - all my progs and files from the old one were transferred to the new one. Great job, Laplink! Thank you!"
1,"Works great. If you get stuck in the update loop, they have a solution on their website."

0,Unable to download from my bank to balance account.  Keep getting message it will be fixed soon on your end.
1,"THIS COMPANY IS AWESOME HVE BEEN USING THEM FOR THE LAST 13 YRS.., THEY LET U KNOW WHEN U NEED TO UPDATE UR FLASH PLAYER ETC."
1,Turbo tax 2014 was pretty easy to use.  It didn't take me long to do our taxes this year but then we don't have as much to deduct as we used to. Filing was also easy.  But the state of Illinois took over a week to accept our filing.  We got our federal refund pretty quickly.  Still waiting for state but then we expected that this year.  I have used TurboTax for several years and have always been satisfied.  Much cheaper than using a tax service.
0,"This product won't do scorp, I am a scorp as the only employee and assumed home and business would cover me. It appears that Business only means a DBA or sole proprietor. This should be spelled out"
1,"I upgraded from version 12 and the data entry and screen refresh is very slow.  I have been a longtime Quicken user and I'm very frustrated with this version.  Thank goodness I did not have the password problem that has affected other users, but entering data is tedious.  Sometimes a hard reboot will help. I don't know if the software is filling up my cache or what, but that seems to help.  Very Frustrating!"
1,Great value.
1,"I am using the Norton 360 some 4 years, and after all this years, trying the all others, this full suite of protection, proved itself as a solid &#34;Anti-All&#34; Internet Horses and Viruses..<br />Recommended!"
1,Excellent product but there is a new version 9.<br />After liking this version you can upgrade for a fair price.
1,"Yeah, it has a monthly fee.  You're &#34;beholden&#34; to Adobe.  But how many of us have purchased multiple versions of this software for many hundreds of dollars?  For me, the math was pretty simple.  If I upgraded every 3-4 years, it's cheaper for me to just buy this version than to feel a sense of ownership over a piece of software that will never get updated.<br /><br />I paint on a Surface 3, and this version makes that a lot easier with the ability to re-size the UI.  I'm not good by any stretch of the imagination, but I do feel that I have all the tools I need to become better, and the creative cloud community has a ton of free tutorials that have been extremely helpful.<br /><br />Of course, you will need to decide for yourself whether the price is something you want to pay, but if that's your biggest complaint about the software, they're doing alright.  Hardly worth the slew of one star reviews of this fine product.  I'll take a star off because of the price, but the application is solid and the features provided are well worth the money for me."
1,"This is actually the first product that I have found that does everything that I need.  It supports GPU acceleration from Intel, AMD, and NVidia.  It supports every file format that I have tried to throw at it.  It supports exporting to many formats at very high speed without transcoding.  It's been a godsend for me."
1,"User friendly, updated constantly without interfering with work in progress, instructions written clearly.  It gives very early warning of incipient problems.  Have used many other malware programs,  Highly recommend."
1,Works well
0,"I have used quickbooks payroll for over 12 years and I am shocked to learn that in addition to the QuickBooks 2014 subscription price there is also a $2.00/employee monthly charge.  I am extremely disappointed to learn that there is an additional cost to an already exorbitant subscription price... which keeps going up.  Even more maddening, the additional charge is not advertised when you purchase the subscription.<br /><br />In addition to the cost, the instructions to activate the subscription are inaccurate.  It normally takes me 5 minutes to install the payroll update.  Today I spent 2 hours dealing with multiple customer service representatives until someone could help me.  The installation process is a nightmare."
1,I enjoy being able to do my own taxes accurately and to e-file my state and federal returns.
1,It works and Amazon pricing is much more affordable than the renewal price offered by Norton
1,So far so good.
1,"Just bought this to help with taxes this year.  I had used a previous version for Mac years ago and so far this one is working well and has some improvements.  It did not get a five star rating because it seems to lack a key feature on investments that I was hoping would be included such as LIFO, FIFO, or Maximum Gain or Loss when selling stock investments. Other than that, I am happy with it and like the ability to check the iOS app that syncs with it too."
0,"I have used Quicken Deluxe for at least 10 years and this is by far the most frustrating version I have used to date. While the potential is there for a great product in this version, I believe it is far too buggy to pay for. Several times I've had split transactions duplicate, resulting in double counting spending in one category and creating an \\""uncategorized\\""  category that I have to go back and clear out later. Other times transfers between accounts will create two transactions in the account the money is being transferred to and it won't allow to delete one without deleting the original transfer and then trying again, hoping this time it does not create a duplicate entry. I hope Intuit can release some sort of patch for these issues, but wish I hadn't been required to upgrade the software to keep the online transaction download option available."
1,"So, So happy with this product. As a Mac user, when I first bought Cook'n, the company was just adding Mac to their user group. SUPPORT has been EXCELLENT!! They have guided me through all the initial glitches of the Mac profile, and now with the CLOUD, support has been super in getting my extended family - covering 5 states and a mix of PC's and Mac's - all working together to create a family cookbook source.<br /><br />I strongly recommend Cook'n for those of you who are looking for an easy to use and easy to share recipe experience.<br /><br />Can I repeat? Cook'n tech support is excellent!!"
1,"It's good, but they make it complicated to install the free version."
1,"1) Repeat customers save time with the welcome back features that allow you to select, edit or delete pre-populated fields saving you valuable time and frustration.<br />2) Tax guide software is a booming business. Turbo Tax has some healthy, less-expensive competition. This year Amazon offers a cool gift card that effectively fends off turbo tax's growing competition. Consider going for the option."
0,Great freebie
1,I had to replace my hard-drive and thought it was time to upgrade my Quicken 2002.  What a difference!  Thanks for the great deal.  I was able to download and be up and running in no time
0,"Not even 1 State tax form is included. They want $40 per state. Yes it was my fault I didn't read the small print. However, I have bought this for many years and it has always included 1 state.  Done with you Turbo Tax!"

You may find some limitations once you start getting deep into editing, but I think this is all I would need for some time.<br /><br />Photoshop elements: For me, the perfect match for Lightroom, as all I at most do with my photos in photoshop is cloning out some distracting elements."
1,It made life so much easier and faster !!!!!  We were able to save on things we never considers.

1,"Effortless renewal, just copy pasted the key and 366 days were automatically added to my account. No issues or problems encountered. Thanks Amazon!"
1,thankyou
1,Best software I have ever used as far as anti-virus programs!  Continual updates & good communication to keep the user informed at all times.  Easy to use if problems are detected as suggestions are made to solve most problems when  found.  It's been very dependable for over the past 4 years.
0,"I'm SHOCKED that it has come to this.<br />So basically adobe is FORCING you to pay FOREVER. I can understand that they would encourage bootleg users to pay for the software, being the subscription mode the best way to do so, but in two years any version of photoshop would be paid in full. Why should I *still* go on paying for a software that I would have owned when creative cloud wasn't around? Why would adobe won't give me the option to update and fully own the software (especially if I purchased previous versions of it?)<br />It is a slap in the face.<br />More so when you can't open your files after you decide to call it quits with your subscription. It is a rip off. Do not pay for it. I rather pay for painter and download gimp or krita for painting."
0,"Someday Quicken, there will be a disruptive technology that will take away your monopoly, and jolt you out of complacency. Your product has really withered since Microsoft Money was discontinued.<br /><br />I pray for the day you clean up this mess."
1,I didn't have many expectations due to this program being free but was very surprised by how well it ran so I have to say money well spent
0,"As a long time Turbo Tax user, I was not happy with Turbo Tax this year.  Somehow Turbo Tax missed my deduction for State and Local Taxes.  I may have skipped over this section, but Turbo Tax should have caught this.  This is a basic deduction anybody itemizing should get.  This resulted in me paying hundreds of dollars more than necessary to the IRS.  The 1040X (amended tax return) form was painful and ultimately just wrong using Turbo Tax.  On-line instructions how to file the 1040X using Turbo Tax were poor saying in general to do different steps, but not telling how to do that using Turbo Tax.  I eventually figured it out, but the 1040X form Turbo Tax printed out was filled out incorrectly, sections of the form directed not to be filled out for my case were filled out.  I had to manually fill out the forms from IRS.gov.  I specifically buy Turbo Tax so I don't have to do that.  I called the Turbo Tax help line in mid February.  The recording said there was a 45 minute wait.  I waited on hold for well over two hours for a agent.  Now I have to wait 16+ weeks to get my 1040X refund from the IRS."
0,"So intuit decided (and without telling anybody in advance) that they'd be pulling Schedules C, D and E out of their Deluxe offering that's had those schedules for years? And then they thought it'd be good enough to offer those Schedules only to customers who had used their product last year? Finally they bow to pressure and give those schedules to us and &#34;promise&#34; that they'll be included in the future.<br /><br />Thanks but no thanks intuit. After being a loyal user for 10 years I can't and won't trust you any longer. There are plenty of other options out there and those companies didn't try yo pull the fast one you did. They deserve my business. You don't"

1,"I had a bit of hesitation after reading the negative reviews, but my wife persuaded me. TaxCut worked well and doing taxes this year was painless.<br />I ran it on Vista Ultimate 64 with no problems (including e-filing).<br />(This is the premium edition even though the title doesn't say it, look at the box shot)."
0,"I have been using Quicken for over a dozen years and initially I used to recommend it to all my friends and family.  NO MORE!<br />For at least the past 3 years I have been increasingly disappointed with this software and no longer recommend it to anyone.  In fact, my standard line now is:  &#34;If you are not already using Quicken, STAY AWAY!&#34;  The only reason I continue to use it myself is that I have already invested so much time and money in this system and all of my financial records are on it so that It would simply be too much of a burden to transfer to another system.  Not only does the current version of Quicken have entirely too many defects but it appears that the staff and management of this company no longer cares.  There is Zero help for this system, aside from that provided from other frustrated users.  Apparently the management has concluded that they will continue to &#34;milk&#34; this system for what they can get out of it and not bother to upgrade it to fix the obvious flaws.  For several years I bought the annual &#34;upgrades&#34; in the naive hope that it would fix problems from the previous years.  From now on, however, I will invest my time in discouraging others from making the same mistakes I have made."
1,"I just installed the 2013 version and am really impressed with the ease of converting all the transaction. It even has made it easier to download transactions for banks, investments. The upcoming bill page is easier to read and really lets you know what is due when. I keep putting off the upgrade as sometimes it is a pain but this really went smooth."
0,"I mistakenly thought this product was aimed at preventing virus infections from Symantec, like Security Scan.  WRONG, this is a whole software suite of virus-like antivirus and IS NOT AIMED at preventing tagalong virus installs like Security Scan.<br />Terrible.  Just terrible."
1,I love it!  I have used TurboTax for my business for the past 10 years and I just love it. Couldn't be any easier.
1,Used Norton for years. I recommend it to all.
1,"This year's version wasn't as friendly as the past few years.  Specifically, the information interface between the Fed's and the State's returns wasn't at all clear in what was required.  This may have something to do with my State's nuances in terms of inputs...i.e., information that isn't directly carried over from the Federal return to the State return.  BUT, if Intuit is going to continue to put out tax prep software, the programming should be completely flawless and State &#34;nuances&#34; should be fully explained to the user.  Otherwise, all is well."
1,You can't beat Avast.  I especially like the boot up scan. I give it five stars.
1,I recommend this software to anyone who wants to create legal document and save hundreds if not thousands of dollars in legal fees. It's also very easy to use.
1,"excellent antivirus program, lightweight use, don't make your device slowly...."
1,"good program I have always used this one , worth the price."
1,I have used Turbo Tax for 15 years. Each year the program gets better and is easier to use. I think the package is worth the price when it contains both the state version and the e-file capabilities.
1,I recommend this product to anyone who will keep their own data security concerns.

1,"This year's download onto my Mac Book Pro was no problem. I have read of other peoples problems', and it's a mystery to me. Of course you have an immediate huge update that must overwrite most of the original download, but that's not unusual.<br /><br />It's an appliance, like a refrigerator, and it does it's assigned tasks well.<br /><br />Over-riding it takes a bit of work-around, but you can do that as well. I work with the forms and forbid the current year's tax software from talking with the prior year's data or accessing my calendar, to control things better. For example if you actual quarterly estimated tax payments aren't identical, Turbo tax gives you a penalty, whereas you can in fact be unequal and the IRS doesn't mind as many self-employed people have income that fluctuates during the year."
1,"Good tool for managing credit, checking, savings accounts.  Nice mobile app component which is great for receipts.  Loss one star due to some minor but inconvenient bugs in mobile app and intuitiveness of desktop interface."

1,"I used TurboTax many years ago and recall leaving when they implemented an activation process that seemed uneccesary (over 10 years ago....[...]).  I switched to H&-R Block and used that for over the past 10 years.  This year (2012), I discovered that the functionality I needed (statement of IRA recharacterization) was not available in H&R Block software.  It was included in TurboTax.  This year, I am E-Filing with TurboTax.  I have to say, I think I will stick with them from here forward.  The software & tax interview is better.  I want to add that the Amazon store return of the H&R Block software was flawless!  No problems at all.  TurboTax has won me back (after a long absence)."
1,"Have used this progam for years - even back when it was called TaxCut.  One year, my husband questioned whether or not we were getting everything we should and had our taxes redone by an accountant.  The results were identical.  He hasn't doubted it since.  It is a very good program that is easy to understand and follow.  It has plenty of help features in every section should you get stuck along the way.  In the 10+ yrs we've used this program, we have never once been audited."

Q2010 keeps trying to reset the balance on my main account to the wrong amount, then when I remove the transaction it puts in, I have to close and reopen the program to get it to recognize the bad balance adjustment is gone.    I don't know why they put all the crap into the program and don't fix the basic problems.  It's slow and really buggy for a program that's more than 10 years old..."

1,"I have worked with the big ones UG, Catia and more. The solid modeling package was easy to learn. Editing the solids takes some learning but in less than a day I was very comfortable with the modeling side. The blend and fillet are fantastic very few problems with adding them to the model at the end. The biggest part of the learning curve was where the operators were in the menus. The drawing package is a bit different than what I am used to but with some practice it seems to be more than adequate. Most suppliers are more interested in the STL and Step files than the drawing. The drawing is more for the tolerances on the parts than the dimensions. I have not found the GD&T package yet but have not tried to hard. If there is not one I have the symbols and can construct one."

On top of this the cost of the books, etc., is very reasonable. Money well spent!"

Notifications are small but insistent (such as now), downloads of upgrades and patches are quick and easy.  For an old semi-techie such as myself the less complicated, the better. Plus, the download price was right."
1,It has some neat sub-sets that can clean out and protect against online radicals.Yeah if and anything folks should give this a go!

I called the 1-800-745-6061 helpline. Every time I call, the response time keeps getting longer and Norton wants to sell me optimization software. I decline the software, reminding them that I have a removal assurance purchase agreement with them.<br /><br />Today was the third time I experienced issues. I called at 5:43 PM local time, waited on hold until 5:55 PM. “Bernard”came on, confirmed the purchase  agreement, and tried to sell me the same optimization package. Once again, I reminded him of me having virus removal assurance as part of the purchase agreement. He connected me to an &#34;expert technician&#34; and put me on  hold again. Technician “Priya” came on at 6:28, reconfirmed my agreement, again tried to sell me same the optimization package. Yet again I reminded her of the purchase agreement. She gave me a case I.D. number, and a phone number to call back: 1-877-788-4877. She  assured me I would be connected to an expert technician with “priority” of no more than 3-4 minutes. Now it is 7:24 PM and I continue to wait while I am writing this. I will be calling the number with case ID and report what happens.<br /><br />I've also been waiting in a &#34;chat&#34; queue with an estimated 3 minute wait time. Of course it's a three minute wait time. That's why there are 98 people ahead of me. DON'T BUY A NORTON PRODUCT BECAUSE THIS IS THE TYPE OF POOR QUALITY SERVICE THEY PROVIDE."
1,This product has saved me a couple times already.  All the features it gives you is great for less than 30 dollars.
1,"Upgraded from Office 2007 and was somewhat surprised by the lack of colors and overall flatness of the suite and this is especially so in Outlook.  As many, many other reviewers have noted the choice of colors in themes being white, medium grey and dark grey is pretty limiting and I'm not sure I understand the goal that MS was attempting to achieve.    With that being said however I have been exceptionally pleased by the capabilities within the applications and for the first time I am actually able to get Outlook's calendar to sync with my Windows Phone although this did require the merging of Outlook's calendar and outlook.com's calendar.  I also discontinued the use of Google calendar and everything is now contained in Outlook.  There may be (and probably are) other ways to accomplish what I did but my method worked well and was simple to implement.    I guess if I had one overall complaint is that you are limited to only a single installation.  I would think that for the price of the suite that two concurrent installations would be acceptable to MS, e.g., a desktop and a laptop installation for a single user.  With that being said I was aware that 1PC/1User was stipulated prior to purchasing so it wasn't like I was blind sided. All in all very pleased with the upgrade after a seven years of abstaining from upgrades."
0,"Last year I became an active stock trader and this year, doing my taxes in Turbo Tax was a frickin' nightmare.<br /><br />(1) TurboTax can handle amounts only up to $10,000,000.  So, if you traded in and out of stocks, IN TOTAL, greater than that amount, you will be screwed.<br /><br />(2) I had over 2000 trades which I imported from my brokers.  However, this caused the program to GRIND TO A HALT.  Apparently, it just keeps recalculating the return over and over again and starts going EXTREMELY SLOWLY!<br /><br />(3) TurboTax customer service is really spotty.  One representative will tell you one thing, one will tell you another.<br /><br />(4) I needed to enter some business information and TurboTax told me that I needed to upgrade from Premiere to Home & Business which I did.  However, as one competent customer service rep told me, that screwed up my software.  I had to uninstall it completely and re-install a clean version.<br /><br />(5) I tried to delete all the trades that had been entered.  TurboTax would not successfully \\""unimport\\"" the imported trades.  Doing it by hand took minutes a trade to delete.<br /><br />I'll never go near this product again."
1,Very good software. Does what it supposed to do with keeping computer protected.
0,"Just a note for Mac users.  Save yourself some money by reading these reviews carefully as there are some warnings for mac users in particular.  Product will only work on a 64 bit mac and yes state \\""e-file\\"" is an extra fee.  Here is how to figure out if your mac is a 64 bit. [...]  ... Don't just operate on the premise that you have 10.6.8."
1,"A very robust product. My computer crashed, this is one of programs, I reinstall"
0,I am unable to convert my Windows data. I spent 2 1/2 hour on the phone with their support (near 1:15 on hold first)!!!!!!!  I wish there was a way to refund it but what I am supposed to do when I just bought a MC.  And little do they tell you that if you have Home and Business you can't convert business to MAC. Let the buyer beware!
0,"Norton Internet Security 2012 contains Norton Confidential which crashes every time I use Google Chrome.  This causes Google Chrome to crash and takes forever to come back.  Additionally, it slows Google Chrome to a slower response time than IE.  Norton's community bulletin board is filled with complaints about this and Norton has been unwilling/unable to address it effectively.  Do not waste your money on this product.  It will drive you nuts trying to deal with it."
1,"While it works it does have some things that I don't like about it. One thing that always gets me is the way that it imports the ESSP (employee stock purchase) stock information from the broker (Fidelity in my case), you MUST go back and edit the information MANUALLY to make sure that the software correctly fills in the actual gain because is already reported as income on your W2 (if you sell within the 1st year of purchase), it would be better if it asked if there is an ESSP activity in the import and then took you through the steps to adjust it correctly.<br />The other thing that happens with this version is that it ALWAYS keeps updating the state return (in my case MA) every time you start it up, even there is not rally any update - it seemed to be stuck in some kind of loop."
0,"Really should not have been released in this form. Way too many bugs! Not just little stuff, but things like estimated tax payments and business mileage are not being handled properly. I bought it early to do some last minute estimating for year-end moves, and it is utterly useless for those of us with self-employment income. I have been using this for years, but I may actually go back to the paper versions because of the poor testing.<br /><br />Seriously, get some new faces for your tax &#34;experts&#34; too - they are the same ones for about the last 3 years, and they still have the same years of experience! Yes, I opened them up side-by-side, same people at the same spots. But mostly, test your software before releasing it."
0,"Everything is smaller in Quickbooks 2014, which makes no sense since there is so much wasted space.  Ship to window, Bill To window, Memo window, every single window that data can be entered there is less space, so you cannot see much of which is typed in these windows.  Customer window on Invoices, Vendor window on Purchase Orders, etc., all have been moved to the right of the screen, when they were previously on the left of the screen, which makes way more sense since we read left to right.  There is no preview icon like in Quickbooks 2011, you have to go to the Print icon first and then choose preview.  There does not seem to be one thing that was improved with the function of Quickbooks, and there were many things that were changed that make Quickbooks 2014 much more inferior to Quickbooks 2011.  Quickbooks has made their Payroll not function unless a new version is purchased every 3 years, so if you do not use Payroll stick with Quickbooks 2011.  Quickbooks 2014 is a total let down and a big waste of time and screen space!  How come we can't assign a tax code for each customer job?! Our customers have projects in 3 separate tax jurisdictions, as wells as tax exempt projects. Every time we change a tax code for 1 project, it changes the tax code for EVERY project. This is a giant hassle, trying to make sure that we keep every Invoice tax code correct.  We are still waiting for a Create Invoice from Purchase Order feature, without this we have to either create an Estimate first and then create a Purchase Order (we could then create an Invoice from the Estimate), but this is silly, if I do not need an Estimate why can't I just create an Invoice from a PO? I would have been happier if Quickbooks gave me the choice to keep 2011 and just pay a fee to be able to continue to use Payroll with 2011 for 3 more years rather than having an inferior version of Quickbooks forced upon me!"
0,Tubo Tax is still scamming people.  Do not buy this.  Even after taking the questionnaire for the correct version I sill had to upgrade a a higher premium to the version to accomplish what I really needed.
1,"The download was quick and efficient. I read the instructions, but still had two questions. I called about the questions, they were answered quickly and the person said he could talk me through the setup. We got to the point where transfer was occurring then I let him go. Things went smoothly."
1,i spent most of my time in high school teaching myself to learn Sony Vegas platinum 10 and later upgraded to version 12. i have spent about 3 or so years using these programs for various YouTube and hobby related projects. when i upgraded to Vegas pro 12 i was expecting to have trouble adapting to it since i spent so much time using its more limited versions.. im glad to say this is not the case. i adapted easily to Vegas and i really love how its laid out in terms of navigation and hot-keys. i would recommend this to any movie studio platinum user. as well as beginners with some spare change they're looking to spend on a new video related hobby.
0,"I purchased this to do my daughter's taxes, because she was a self-employed contractor for part of the year. She also moved during the year, and lived in two states. Other than that, her tax situation is simple and straightforward.<br /><br />I filled out her federal return easily. The program was easy to use and I appreciated it downloading her W-2. I downloaded the first state, and completed the return with just a few more clicks. When I began to download the second state, suddenly I get presented with a $40 bill to download the second state. Reluctantly, I paid it because I wanted to get this finished this afternoon while my daughter was visiting.<br /><br />I completed the second state return, and then moved on to file the returns. Another nasty surprise: e-filing a state return is $20 each. Since my daughter had already left to return home, I paid the additional $40, despite the sour taste it left. I tried to file the returns, and got an error: Transmission of your returns failed, an update is required. The Check For Updates function did not find any updates. I tried again, and received the same error. Searching their online user forums provided a solution: Quit the program, restart it and try again.<br /><br />I was able to complete the three returns and eventually file them. The program was definitely helpful in doing that, and the forms were generally clear and easy to use. I am annoyed that I did not see the add-on fees in the description, and paid $150 when I thought I was getting in for $72."
1,"As described, loaded right up, helpful tool."
0,"This particular product kept have \\""fatal errors\\"" and would not install properly even though I ve had Norton before and product said it would work w windows 7. Spent way too much time, literally hours with support both thru amazon and Microsoft. Eventually sought refund and went with different spyware that installed easily and has been working perfectly. Just wish now Norton would stop sending messages. Went with highly recommended Bitdefender which was similar price and a chinch to install. Would highly recommend but beware as you must uninstall all components of Norton or I would assume other products first. No complaints w Amazon, your customer service was at a loss how to proceed and suggested refunding Norton product and trying something else, so kudos to your end of the transaction."
1,Awesome protection!!! Cant go wrong with this. I love knowing my computer has full protection. Thanks Avast! My greatest appreciation.
0,Mint.com user and love it.....thought I would move to the pay product for better support and tools. I was so wrong wasted my money.
1,"i have used everything from norton to avg to panda, and this is the best!  I really appreciate that it works quietly in the background and does not bother me with stupid pop-ups all the time."
1,This works great.
0,I could not download the Norton Security.  I contacted Norton customer service that said &#34;I had to much curruption on my PC&#34; and would have<br />to download some kind of program to clear it up. I told the customer service representative  that I had a current Norton Security program on my PC and that it should download. Customer service than said that I would have to go back to Dell to clean up the program (which didn't make sense to me).  Besides that I could hardly understand the personnel at customer service.  Their english was terrible.  I contacted Amazon and had my purchase of Norton Security program nullified and received the monies paid to Norton.  I am now with McAfee.
0,"This does not work. I installed it for my son, used it once, closed it, ate dinner, tried to reopen it - nothing. Screen goes blank, then program crashes. Reboot and reinstall does not fix the problem. It's a buggy mess. I want a refund and will be contacting the software company and my credit card company to stop payment."
1,"It works great and is more than I need but it's there if and when I can use it. It is HARD facing up to your bills but you have to and Quicken HELPS A GREAT DEAL for you to do it and helps you to understand what you need and how you will use it and set up your bill paying so your not surprised at anytime during the month !  Quicken helps you but doesn't make you pay bills and , in time, save something form nothing now !!!"
1,"My only qualm is that for regular people, figuring out what it actually does is a bit obscure. Make it more apparent and accessible so even the grandma can use and understand its benefits and you will see your product improve in prominence."
1,As expedited
1,Bought this over Turbo. My neighbor has turbo I have Block. I entered my taxes on both came out exactly the same to the penny.
1,What can I say....I like Norton over McAfee.

1,"I switched from a PC to a Mac and needed to replace my cookbook.  After reading reviews for several cookbook programs I chose this one and am glad I did.  It is easy to use.  You can create your own cookbooks with chapters for different types of recipes.  I found a recipe on line that I liked.  I simply copied the url address, pasted it in the Cook'n program and it automatically took all the information from the site and formatted the title, ingredients with amounts, and the directions all in the program's recipe card.  I was impressed.  it also captured the picture of the dish as well.  Couldn't be any easier.  Tis program also syncs to the cloud. I also downloaded the app for my android phone and it was able to sync with the cloud and now I can access all my recipes on the phone which makes it easy when visiting and need a particular recipe or if a friend wants it, I can email it him/her.  Sharing is easy.  This is one of the most expensive programs out there but I feel it is worth the price.  There are discount codes out there.  I found one for 20% off.  You are also entitled to a free download from the numerous cookbooks that are available.  When you factor in the coupon and the free cookbook the price becomes comparable to the other programs out there."
1,Found 5 threats as soon as i downloaded it. I had avast and it said everything was fine. Download this and it find threats and eradicates them.  Beat free security software out there
1,I've used Quicken for years and just now upgraded to Quicken 2015.<br />Love all the features.  Great product.
1,I am well-pleased with Norton 360.
1,"This program is amazing! I knew my budget would be a little high this month as I was started my budget on 3/8/14 and some of my transactions didn't fully hit my account until the beginning of March. I added all of my transactions from as far back as 8/2013. SUPER EASY and didn't take any time to do it. I love the fact that my bank has an export button for this program and it puts the icon on my desktop. I double click on it, and it automatically updates my transactions into the program. I have used QuickBooks for a previous employer and I liked it, but I knew that when it came to managing my money, I didn't need all of those functions and wanted something basic and easy to use.<br /><br />This program allows me to view my spending habits in different graph forms. It gave me a template to create a budget for myself and lets me know when I am going over on a category or how much I have left to spend in each category. I set up the bills tab just because and it calculates when money will be hitting my account and when bills will be due. I can manage alerts for my phone or e-mail if I am over spending, when bills are due, and when I get paid.<br /><br />They have an app for my phone and I can view the main/core information that I see on my desktop, but on my phone. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save and keep better track of their money."
1,Have always used it will continue.
0,Tried this out.  Used it to compute estimated 2014 taxes.  But I still prefer Turbotax.
1,nice kit
1,"I have used Norton, AVG and Microsoft Essentials. I find AVAST the fastest scanning, always dependable. Not a resource hog like some others. AVAST is a great antivirus, the best."
1,Very clear software.
1,at first I thought it was one of those to good to be true deals and so far everything is secure and I'm glad I made the purchase! thank you!
1,"[[ASIN:B000HDKVCM Microsoft Office Home And Student 2007- Service Desk Edition]]    Quick download, Fast installation, Fast start-up of program.  No problems thus-far!      Definetly will purchase from Amazon in the future!!"
1,"Trial period is twice as long as what Norton offers online. Great opportunity to try out Norton product. Works well, will purchase at the end of trial."
1,Works as advertised. Only smaller issues with new versions.
1,"Simple and easy to express opinion about my purchase of Microsoft Windows 8 Pro Pack (Win 8 to Win 8 Pro Upgrade).<br />I bought a new notebook to replace my aging Windows 7 notebook, but, unlike me, I overlooked the fact that it came with Windows 8 Standard version. Since my intended use for this notebook was for media processing, it needed to be Windows 8 Pro with Media capability. Thus the purchase of the upgrade. The upgrade was installed, and I have been setting it up for its debut with respect for official retirement of my Windows 7 notebook.<br /><br />Take note that if you want to purchase a Windows 8 computer, make sure that it is the Pro version, which provides you with more capabilities, and not having to invest additional money in all the upgrades."
1,Minus a question here or there that is wrong/off the tool works great. it esespecially helpful to supplementing the material from the books.
0,"Horrible product. I installed it in hopes of keeping my computer clean and running to get me through college. While having it on my computer, some kind of malware has gotten in (how I have no idea, haven't downloaded anything in forever). But anyway, I've scanned it with Norton Security 360 and installed the Norton Power Eraser, both of which have told me my computer is fine. Meanwhile, I'm constantly fighting fake ads and having random pages opened in my browser while i'm trying to do homework and study. I have done everything humanly possible to get this fixed with no success. Do not waste your time with this product, it is horrible."
1,It works great!
0,Didn't even download on my laptop ...a waste of money ..I tried contacting someone about fixing it or a refund but to no avail ....never buying software through amazon again ..second time their programs didn't work ...
1,In all honesty it is simply the best. Avast does not take hours to scan your computer like others do and is very affordable with many quality features and functions.
1,"I've continually used this product over the years, and I still recommend it for those who are single and married or even those with small businesses - although a regular CPA might be needed in that instance. This product never fails, and it gets simpler to use with every release."
0,"Awful, one wrong move and it may destroy your system"
0,I was unable to download after the trial period ..and I had paid amazon. I tried many times with no success.
0,After many tries at downloading the product I spent many HOURS on the phone with Intuit trying to get it loaded and working.  They were very pushy about trying to sell me a much more expensive product and said that I wouldn't be having this problem if I would have bought their more expensive product from them. I just needed a basic quickbooks version for a small business. I think if they have it for sale than it should work without having to call them and listen to a half hour advertisement on why you should buy something more expensive.  It was like they were holding my program hostage until I gave them more money. I did not give in but demanded that they make what was sold to me work.  My first experiences have not been positive ones.
0,"I've been filing my own taxes for over a decade.  The tax code is definitely unwieldy and confusing, but I sat down and familiarized myself with it anyway.  I've used TurboTax, TaxAct and TaxCut, mostly TaxAct since it gives free Federal filing.  It's also less expensive than the others by a wide margin.  I decided to give TurboTax another chance to see if it could handle my tax requirements this year.    My first mistake was buying the Premier version instead of the Deluxe version.  Either I misread the description or it was changed after I bought it, because I could have sworn I saw 1 free State efile.  However the description says nothing of the sort now, and I have no way to verify what actually happened.  That's not a big deal, but what is a big deal is how this program does its error checking.  The issue is that TurboTax does not go over some of the extremely less common deductions - which are valid deductions - so you have to modify the form directly to add it in.  My largest deduction is a third of my annual income; that's not chump change.  Without that deduction I'd have to go to zero exemptions and still owe both governments money every year; screw that.  TaxAct asks the question, even though it's somewhat buried.  Don't know if TaxCut does, but it's probably a good bet that it doesn't.  Points for TaxAct here - until we get smart enough to pass FairTax, I have to suffer this robbery, so I need to make sure I get back what I'm owed, period.    So I mentioned about the State filing; there is an error check step near the end, and for mine it gave me a clean bill.  It also stated that I was low risk for audit, except for my business expenses as I use my car for work purposes...I've got all sorts of documentation for that, so no biggie (although, another negative about this later).  Problem is that it gets to the point of efiling, and it will bill you $20 before it will file the State.  AFTER billing you, it does another \\""more rigorous\\"" check, and that's whenit will reject your efile...if you manually modify the form in any way, even if the program is overlooking critical deductions, it won't allow you to efile.  This is simply silly, because it does calculation verification earlier anyway; what's the point of this?    I sent an email to Intuit demanding my $20 back.  Haven't heard ne'er a word from them.  I imagine that money is Lost in Emotion...que sera, que sera.    The program is also spotty with its math.  I had to print the forms 4 separate times, because each time I'd go through it, I would look on the form and notice a critical oversight.  For example, I told it to import my 2008 data from TaxAct (a cool feature, mind you), but when it did, it imported blatantly wrong, and it didn't ask me to verify each piece of information that was imported.  It never pulled any of the financial data either, only my name, address, and exemption status, all of which were wrong.  It logged me as being subject to someone else claiming me as a dependent even though that was never the case; I was confused when I got to the Making Work Pay credit and having it tell me this even though it just wasn't true.  Then I went through and itemized my deductions; first it claimed that because my itemized deductions were significantly higher than the standard deduction that I should do that, resulting in a hefty refund.  After I printed the forms again, I noticed that I had overlooked two things; first, I had two business cars for the year, one of which was new.  It logged the New Car deduction properly, and it claimed I had over 50% business utilization.  The problem is, when I added the other car, which had just as many business miles as the new car, it treated them as separate for purposes of business use calculation.  Now maybe that's the tax code, I don't know, but together they still added up to over 50%, yet all of a sudden I was not eligible for these deductions and was forced to go back down to standard.  That was quite irritating.The refund is still high, but it dropped by a little over 1k because of that.    So, there you have it.  It's not a bad program if you have complex taxes to file, just know that unlike their claim, you're probably not getting all of the credits and deductions you should be getting.  If you aren't familiar with the tax code specific to your individual situation I suggest you get cracking on reading up about it, because if you don't, you won't know that you're missing out.  I also recommend TaxAct above this program, as while it's not as \\""pretty\\"" as TurboTax, it goes into the nitty-gritty of your tax situation better to where you're maximizing the deductions and credits properly."

0,"I thought I was upgrading THE Quicken software that I use ONLY as a check register that I can reconcile and balance my monthly bank statements with.<br /><br />This new version (I feel) is an invasion of my bank account, since they insist on starting the whole program by opening my existing bank account and downloading the information contained in it.  I find this invasive; it is not what I was looking for, and I will not continue to use this software for the fact it delves into my bank and bank account.<br /><br />Quicken does not give you the option simply to open a checking account and follow your day-to-day transactions and reconciliations as the original Quicken did.  I am not looking for all the convoluted information, etc., that Quicken 2013 assumes.  I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK since I can't open up my account without logging in to my current banking institute - and I DO NOT LIKE THIS!!!<br /><br />NO ONE ASKED QUICKEN TO GO THIS ROUTE.  Let me off the hook!"
1,I have nothing bad to say about it and my computer has never had any problems<br />since I've been using it (probably about 4 years now).
1,Love the electronic download
1,"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.<br /><br />If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.<br /><br />I just finished a preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 10, 2013.<br />Note that I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State, and in this review I am including only the review of the federal forms. The federal forms part of the product are identical, of course, whether one buys the State add-on or not.<br /><br />1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.<br />It would have better if they waited until the financial information is entered and offered the Premium version only to those for whom it might make sense.<br /><br />What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividents, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.<br /><br />Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. This year I had to do both, and I found the guidance to be sufficient to complete the forms.<br /><br />2. As of 11/19/2012 videos for tax law changes were not available yet (the prompt said coming soon).<br /><br />3. Minor pet peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on \\""learn more\\"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which words to use locate the relevant topics.<br /><br />4. Good news: DeductionPro 2012 is now integrated into H&R Block, you no longer need to go to H&R web site.<br /><br />5. H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example from mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.<br /><br />6. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.<br /><br />7. I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the taxreturn file.<br /><br />8. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. Nice!<br /><br />9. H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal state e-files.<br /><br />10. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter \\""price history alert\\"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful. I just looked up that the price last year during the tax preparation season hit the $20 mark on three different dates. You can set up an alert tool to email you when your desired price has been reached.<br /><br />11.

1,"I needed this fast to take care of a problem with my computer, it was here on time.  Works great! Thanks"
1,"I have used this program for years. my old laptop went on the fritz, so I could use the windows program and had to rely on the tablets app's the app was the worst ever. I need my window dvd profiler. I can make changes add front and back cover pictures. just a whole lot more enjoyable."
1,Upgraded from ver. 10 (previously owned ver. 9) and find this version to work just fine. Interface is cleaner. Works for me!
0,"I have been using Quicken since the intitial version and have been happy with it until this version. I had been using v2011, but finally updated and now I am realizing it was a big mistake. The basic functionality works (although slower than in prior versions) but the &#34;One Step Update&#34; has yet to work properly. I have had it for two months now and it still can't update all accounts. I have had to reset accounts multiple times and it still doesn't work. One account hasn't updated properly for 1-1/2 months.<br />If you are using an older version, skip this one."
1,I moved from quickbooks desktop to online. I have a simple one person business and Quickbooks desktop was way to much for me. Quickbooks online is nice simple and easy and it ties directly into my bank account so my books are always balanced.
1,"Software is a must to get your taxes done.  The IRS couldn't find my return for 2011 (guess I should not have donated to a conservative group) so it would have cost me hundreds to have an expert do it, so I got this product and other years too."
0,"Have not been able to download the program.  I let it run all night and it still says &#34;finding download&#34;.  I guess it can't find the app to download.  Glad I didn't have to pay cash for this download.  Need to revise this review.  Once I install the Amazon downloader, it loaded and was installed immediately.  However, I still haven't figured out how to access and use the checkbook, which is the only thing I wanted to use."
0,"Not enough details - like listing investments, bank accounts, etc. This is a VERY general shell of a will kit."
1,excellent as always-why do I nee to say more.  The quick red fox jumped over the sleeping dog. good night
1,"Previously we were using spreadsheets and tax circulars to compute our payroll and other spreadsheets to gather our tax reporting information.  Even with only two employees with relatively stable salaries, it was time consuming and error-prone.  Now I can complete payroll in a matter of minutes and tax forms are electronically transmitted along with payment instructions.  I feel like I have stepped into the 21st century."
1,"After Norton basically lost their minds and decided to charge asinine prices for their Antivirus, I decided to try Trend. So far I've had no problems and only positive experiences.<br /><br />It has a very easy UI. One of the nicest things I've noticed is that it never feels intrusive or &#34;annoying&#34; like past McAfee and Norton's I have had. It does its job and lets me know if there are any problems. There's really not much else to say."
1,Excellant
1,"What I mean is that you can get your taxes done quickly with Turbo Tax. I've used this product for at least 18 years and always has worked well for me. I do think they are milking customers with all the add-on upgrades and charging for state returns, though.<br />They should include everything at one price and be done."
0,"First, it was a bait and switch not to have the complete program as previous years in this Deluxe edition, and secondly, I am not about to send my social security number for a $25.00 rebate to what could possibly be a scam site.  That is just simply not worth the associated risk.  So, Intuit wins again."
1,Great antivirus coverage. Quick response to viruses and malware. Better than the software that you have to purchase. I does everything I need and it is free!
0,"I will give it a 1 star for 2 reasons:<br />1) Is is fairly easy to use.<br />2) I cannot give it a zero!<br /><br />I did my daughters taxes using turbotax. It is a simple tax return with w-2's only. I chose the &#34;cheap&#34; $30 option. I finished answering all of the questions, had all the info in the correct boxes and had the bank account setup to pay turbotax and receive the refund. I see the final screen and it says it is charging me for the upgraded version even though I did not ok it(or atleast I thought). But I was giving it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I did click the wrong turbotax package. But the only way to find out was to ERASE ALL THE INFO I just entered. Everything. So I did it all again, this time with my wife watching me. Got to the end and the same charge appears. Total scam! They know it will do it. They are just banking on the idea that you will go ahead and submit it so you wont have to go thru all the trouble of entering all the info another time. WRONG!!<br /><br />I went to  TAXACT and had NO problems. And it cost $20 instead of $60 for turbocrap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"On the few occasions (for me) that Avast does detect, a very visible warning pops up BEFORE any action is taken to allow user to choose to continue or delete.  Avast has no conflict with any other programs I use."
1,"My company is paperless and I work remotely with my clients. A cloud-based bookkeeping system is imperative for me, as I work in other offices and don't always want to have my laptop at the ready. I have used the product in the past and found it clunky and confusing. They have cleared up all of the glitches I did not like, such as difficulty navigating menus and in adding categories, etc. I simply love the new clean format. It is not 100% but it works great for my business."
1,I have recommended Avast to everyone I know for years now! It is amazing how well a free product can actually work.
0,"This is a clone of &#34;Muvee Reveal X&#34;. It has 12 movie styles.<br />Easy to use, easy to make good movies for beginners.<br />Original Muvee reveal supports Korean, but It doesn't.<br />If it's corrected, it'll be more suitable for me because native language is more familiar than English."
1,"Having used Quicken for almost fifteen years and having my payee, category lists and reminders all set up, not to mention &#34;archived&#34; files, I was reluctant to change to another financial app due to my recent iPad purchase and pending changeover to a Mac computer. I tried an alternative to Quicken for the iPad but was totally unsatisfied and it wasn't capable of syncing with any available app for a Windows PC. My Quicken Deluxe 2011 online services were about to expire with no suitable replacement. Then I searched Amazon and found I could get Quicken Deluxe 2014 for a great price. I was running out of time so I decided to purchase and worry about the Mac changeover later. Then I found the Q14 App for iPad which syncs perfectly with Quicken on my PC and it works so well that if a full Quicken Deluxe version for Mac does not become a reality I will use Parallels on my future Mac to run the Windows Quicken Version. I am completely satisfied with my decision to stick with Quicken and this is my second Quicken purchase from Amazon."
1,"Still learning what it can do, but love what I have learned so far. The video portion is amazing.<br />Thanks"
1,"If your tax return can be filed on a 1040 form this software will let you file.  It contains all the forms required for any individual or married couple and their dependents to file for any income including rental and self employment.  Since it is available from H&R Block which has local offices available year round everywhere, some support is available locally including audit support."
0,I did not get that much usage in the short period allowed.  The Avast Antivirus did perform on a constant basis and provided alerts while I was working on programs online that gave me information to use in my decision to continue to abort.  I have nortion trial install on my computer.  I did not get the production from the Norton antivirus I received from Avast.  I have Kaspersky installed and it done not perform up to expectations.  I am moving forward with a website and other external platforms and do not want to invite an antivirus with my activity.
0,A wate of time effort and money.  Cumbersome to use -  user UNFRIENDLY.  Not using it at all.  Wish I could get a refund.  Especially disliked giving acess to various bank accounts.  Hard to believe a company of this stature would have such a bad product.  I will never buy another Quicken product.
1,I have been using this for the past two years and it has been great for keeping my pc fast and clean as well as updated.
0,have been using it for years and its been consistent. its not as flexible to navigate as i would like
1,People are never satisfied. Quickbooks is one of those products you upgrade every third year or so. But let's face it there are very few accounting software packages out there that don't have normal upgrade cycles. Yes accounting and bookkeeping is pretty boaring and simple and repetative. But that doesn't mean you can buy software and use it for the next twenty years without upgrades.
1,"I have been using Quicken since version 1 or 2 in the late eighties. It has always had some annoying peculiarities I admit, and it has occasionally frustrated me, but hey, so has my wife, and we have stayed happily married a lot longer than I have been using Quicken. I use Quicken, QuickBooks, and TurboTax regularly. I have used Quicken on every MS OS since DOS 3, and on every platform since the 8086 days until my current home-built Core Duo with Win 7 64 bit. Inuit forces me to update much more often than I prefer, and I wish they would just allow me to pay an annual fee and use their automated update system to modify the software under the hood instead of forcing me to upgrade every three years in order to continue the online updates of my financial institutions.     Anyway, seeing several negative reviews of Quicken on Amazon was surprising to me, and I decided to chime in to give a little balance. Having used this product consistently for over 20 years, I can say without hesitation that is the most trouble free, least complicated piece of software I have ever used. It has quirks; downloading data from financial institutions is still a work in progress, but honestly, 99.44% of the time, the software and downloads work really well, and the 2010 version is improved over the 2008 version as far as the interface with the financial institutions. I upgraded because ver. 2010 is designed to work with Win 7 64 bit. I have over 200,000 transactions in my data file, and have never lost so much as a decimal point. Of course, I back up each time I make entries or download data as well. The program also makes regular backups in its program data file. There is NO way to lose Quicken data; there are too many redundant files for that to happen.   I cannot speak for Money users' woes when migrating to Quicken, but I imagine a little searching on Quicken and/or Money user forums or Google searches could provide some assistance for their issues. And, being a regular shopper at Amazon and having dealt with Intuit CS occasionally over the years, I am very suspect about not being able to come to some satisfactory resolution with either of the companies about refunds or credits if the claims are legitimate. Neither company is hard-nosed. (If you want to deal with a company that really doesn't care about their customers, try AT&T, but I digress.)       I see at least one individual has had trouble with his scheduled transactions working and unsuccessful in modifying those transactions. At a certain point, if the medium is unreliable, it would seem they would either change their method of doing business, or go online to the free Quicken forums and discover how others are coping with the same problems, with the same software, and same financial institutions. Or--like Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh--they can just sit on the nettle and complain about it hurting their bottom if that is their idea of fun.     Intuit is an American corporation that has managed to dodge the take-overs, competitors, and new concepts that have made so many other companies disappear. I give them credit for producing reliable, intuitive, straight forward financial software that simplifies home and small business accounting for those of us who need the help. And, no, I do not work for or even own stock in Intuit."
1,"Inexpensive compared to others, but easy to use, accurate and backed by H&R Block if audited which provided peace of mind."
1,"I first bought and downloaded \\""Riddle Me\\"" two years ago and still LOVE and USE it. I have used it to make family chores \\""fun\\"", for birthday parties, family reunions and church activities. It's a quick and easy way to make a treasure hunt without having to think up all the clues and hiding places. Being able to select ages, types of hunts and locations for the hunt, make the possibilties endless."
1,"I've been using the free version of Avast for many years.  In conjunction with my Windows protection, I haven't had a problem at all."
1,"I like to make stuff like birthday greetings and customize them, this downloaded purchase works very well for me, a good improvement compared to their earlier versions where I have to replace different discs for different images, very easy to use, no hassle, love it ;)"
1,"Being prompted to review though it's hard to do as I've not completely learned QB's yet. But, the price was certainly right!"

0,"A recent upgrade to Windows 7 64-bit forced me to give up using MS Money 2000.  I had been using the old version on Money to manually track all my accounts.  My plan is to do the same with Quicken.  While I know it takes time to get used to any new user interface, I found Quicken to be user unfriendly and lacking.  My biggest grip is how to enter data.  Quicken uses ledger format with a record in one row.  I know this is traditional accounting format, but one plus to the old MS Money was that you can view your entry on a graphical layout that looks like a check or a deposit slip and it had tabs for credits, debits and transfers.  I find myself stumbling around the Quicken window trying to find basic functions.  For example Reconcile and Transfer Money are under the Account Actions button.  There's plenty of real estate for making popular functions their button.    Another silly grip is that when you reconcile, it does a window pop-up.  With my old MS Money, I could tile Money and my PDF statement to go through and reconcile the entries.  But since the reconcile page is pop-up you cannot arrange your windows to do a side-by-side or top and bottom.  I did use the function to download account data when initially configuring the program.  It contacted my credit union but failed to retrieve and records.  For my mainstream bank and credit card company it was somewhat more successful. For my credit card it somehow messed up the initial balance and showed a current balance that was way off. It took me a while review, and fix all my accounts from the data it downloaded.  This is why I am manually entering data as mentioned above.  That, plus I prefer to see payments to my credit card as post dated transfers and not have a several day discrepancy between to two accounts until the payment clears online.  On the positive side, I do like how the bills are shown in a graphical manner.  And the program does track your accounts.  Reports are interesting but probably not significantly useful for me.  But for a company who has been in the business of personal finance software for probably over 20 years, I am woefully unimpressed with the user interface.  Not sure how today's quicken compares with that of decade ago (online features aside) but one would think that would be enough input from consumers to evolve and efficient and affective interface."
1,"I tested almost any Mac screen recorder i can find.<br />This  one at first has pretty basic functionality but did what i need  and offer me with one of the best  performance and also was easy to use.<br />It gives you to select fps(up to 60) , draw selection , use present  or full screen mode recording.<br />Captures in h264 so sizes are not way too big and can be used right away. The system sound was recorded without issues for me.<br />If you want it is possible to  convert to popular devices when exporting.<br />I'm using on Mac mini mid2011.<br />Overall does what i need.<br />Wish they can make custom presents that can remember position and size as right now it only has fixed resolutions."
0,"Very disappointed. I always file under extension so I bought Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe in July. I used Deluxe 2013 for last year and none of my circumstances have changed materially. Well, running 2014 Deluxe I discovered that I was solicited to pay $30 in order to upgrade to Premiere, because Deluxe no longer supports entering S corp K-1 schedule info for Schedule E. Yet I read in various posts here that Intuit had acknowledged their &#34;mistake&#34; and provided free upgrades for Deluxe customers in my situation. Well it turns out the free upgrade was only if you filed your return by April 30, 2015. The irony is TT reps have stated here that they will have this &#34;fixed&#34; for 2015 returns, which means that for some reason the only customers &#34;burned&#34; by this are those who bought their TT Deluxe in good faith in order to file their 2014 returns on extension. WHY should WE be penalized?! I paid the $30 begrudgingly, because I had done most of the work and wasn't included to start all over with H&R Block software. As far as I am concerned if a tax software is going to drop a major component of what they cover, it's obligated to make this clear in its marketing both in online descriptions and on the box itself. Nowhere does it indicate that Sch K-1 coverage has been dropped.<br /><br />The software seems to work fine, as it did last year. But this kind of &#34;bait and switch&#34; marketing, just to drain more money out of customers.... this just isn't do right by regular customers."
1,"Easy purchase, download and install.  Have used earlier versions and this is an improvement over  my last purchase."
1,Used it for many years and then tried something different that didn't do the job that I expected it to do.
0,"I tried to use it, but ended up setting it aside.<br /><br />Way to complicated for me (I've been using various consumer software for over 30 years).<br /><br />Maybe when I have more time to mess around, but a big disappointment in regard to ease of use!<br /><br />I expected more for a 2015 product and in the day of point and click.<br /><br />If they were smart they would test the software by seeing how far along people (regular everyday working people, not company people) would get in the program after 30 minutes of use.  If their still playing around, not good enough for release."
1,Great protection.
1,Worked great
0,"Turbo tax really upset me this year. I'll probably go with H&R BLOCK next year. True they got the form thing right but only because they were put under pressure. Then I went and tried to e-file the State return for $24 bucks and it kept rejecting it (with a &#34;error message&#34;) unless I paid an added $34 to have the $24 cost taken out of my refund, This is A CLEAR TURBO TAX SCAM!!!! I bet they would lose in court on this one. So I just mailed it for free. Turbo Tax I hope you feel it next year with customers leaving."
1,"It works, for me it is easier than getting all the docs together to take to a tax preparer. A few years back I was called for an audit and it was clear the IRS auditor fully accepted my TurboTax printouts as clear evidence that everything was in order. No finding against me in the audit."
1,"Great starter, to get you going..."
0,"Very limited storage for music lovers, unless you want to pay an extra 20 or $25 and then the chances of you being able to upload your music is greatly exaggerated.  Plus, unlimited devices means devices that can connect to internet.  MP3 devices cannot use music services."
1,"I was a little behind the times - I went from the Quicken 2001 version to the Quicken 2013 version, and the softwares improvements are great! I used to have to enter each receipt into the computer, which would take forever, but now my transactions can be automatically downloaded, and has saved me a lot of time.<br /><br />  I'm still learning the software, but I like the graphs and the fact that you can enter your budget. I would definately recommend this to anyone."
0,"Like many other reviewers, I had multiple issues with this product:<br />The cloud sync took forever and did not work<br />Duplicate transactions, some of them quite old, which completely threw off the balances.<br />Net worth report did not work.  Showed zeros for everything, even though I had all accounts selected.  Also could not see the net worth graph.  I would select \\""see full graph\\"", but nothing would happen.<br />Could not see transactions on loans.  I could see a nice graph of when the loan would be paid off, but when When I selected \\""transactions\\"", nothing would happen.  I was stuck with only the graph.<br />The mobile app was not great. All I could see were bank and credit accounts, no investment accounts.  Not very useful to me.<br />One positive note is that Intuit refunded my money, no questions asked.  I then uninstalled 2013, which was an adventure in itself.  The regular Windows uninstaller would not work, so I had to download a couple of files from Intuit.  But once 2013 was gone, I could reinstall 2011 and start over from my latest backup.  So now I am back in action and can forget my brief 24-hour Quicken 2013 nightmare!"
0,I like turbo tax better
1,Very easy to use for people like me who aren't tax pros.
0,It's protect our system from virus. But while scanning it take high CPU utilization.
1,"I upgraded to the Windows 8 Pro Pack on an Dell Inspiron already running Windows 8, the cheapest laptop Best Buy offered at around $300. It took about 45 minutes total. Not one issue."
1,Great product for not too much money. Downloaded quickly & easily! and it works great! couldnt be happier and Im going to buy another one!
1,"Easy to use, worked well for me."
1,I use avast on every device I have. There is no need for any other software. Avast is perfect and has it all.
1,"Easy install - after removing previous security product.  Used CCleaner to get bits left behind, and to freshen the Registry from  previous security product, then a standard reboot.  Nicely, unobtrusive.  I would have given 5 stars, but for a few things I have heard from friends and comments on the Internet.  Norton Internet Security beats the rest, most of the time according to PC World, PC Computing, and the like."
1,"I would highly recommend this product because<br />1. It does what it promises, convert files, without any crashes or freezes in the process, works perfectly, in my experience that's rare for software in general<br />2. the quality of files that are made smaller is very good, you take 100's of MB of and still the quality is very good<br />3. it's easy to use, don't have to read instructions to use the basics<br />In general, these people know what they're doing and really deliver something good."
1,"I love Turbo Tax, it help take a lot of guess work out."
1,"I've been using this software for few years now, many good features provided by it. The boot scan, everyday database update and customization are a few that I like the most. Thank you."
1,"Highly recommend it , and my purchase was quick and easy"
1,"Avast has caught things so fast on my laptop, it's been amazing!  They have a good filters .Thank You Avast!!"
0,"Has flaws, does not allow you to change items or numbers when you realize you have made a mistake. My city tax is all wrong, when I go to edit as the faq says it will not accept or allow me to change anything on it."
1,good
1,I had issues with PC download.  I run 64 bit Windows 7 and Amazon downloader would not work on any browser no matter what I did.  Tech support tried to help but their suggestions did not work.  I was able to download and install it but running Windows compatibility program which changed the compatibility settings for Amazon downloader to Windows XP.  That did the trick.  I am not sure if anyone else had similar issues.  I did not expect the simple download to take up most of the morning though.
0,Bad down load don't waste your money this is the worst online download I have purchased in the last ten years
1,I use this program all the time. I recommend it for every small business.  I am very happy with the program.
1,I do not know how to rate Avast; it was put on my computer when I took it to a repair shop remove a virus that I acquired.  I previously had Avira antivirus and did not have any problems with it either until the computer stopped working.  I have heard several people mention the importance of having antivirus software.
1,"After using the desktop version for more than 10 years, I found the online version to be far easier to keep up to date.  I do wish though that the credit card processing offered a tip option to clients when they sign."
1,Best AntiVirus out there.  I use this for work and gaming and I have to say my laptop has never performed so well before.  Will Purchase Again!
1,"Hey... I don't have a lot of twists and turns in my taxes.  I could do it by hand myself, I just like the way Turbo Tax walks me through it so I don't forget something.  That, and I have all the worksheets worked out for my records. The $50 bucks I spent on it is less expense than taking my papers to someone to do"
1,I've been using Norton for many years. I trust that program to get the job done and protect our pc.
0,"This product will not download to my computer. I have contacted Amazon and Corel receiving nothing but the same troubleshooting tips over and over, none of which work. It shows an error when i try to install it. I even tried to download it to my PC instead of the new laptop that I wanted to use it on just to see if it works and it does not. This was a total wast of my money and I still cannot write on my laptop I am disappointed in the product and the lack of support from Amazon and Corel both!  I finally got a reason from Microsoft explaining why this product doesn't work. Although it plainly says it is compatible with Windows 8, it is only compatible with Windows 7."
0,"Support was poor and trying to locate some information was illogical. I had to call support up a few times. The first time was to find out where to enter some dta that i had missed entering. First I contacted them on their online chat. Had to wait 20 minutes just to be told to call a phone number. The first time i did, when I finally reached an agent, the call was cut off. The second time, the agent said she had to transfer me to someone else. After being put on hold for 45 minutes, a fax machine picked up and the call was cut off. The 3rd time, an agent finally directed me to where to input the info. I subsequently had 2 other questions that I had to call on. On the 2nd problem, the agent spent over 1 1/2 hours on the phone to fix the problem because the system did not have a clearcut way of doing it (splitting a State tax refund between applying part of a refund to next year's estimated taxes and refunding the remainder. The program also cost much more than other programs like H&R Block at home."
0,Horrible
1,The best image processing software!
0,It charged me for filing and never gave me my first filing free - The process to get your money back is to exhausting on purpose
1,Does the trick!!
1,Have been using Turbo tax for several years now and everything always is clear and easy.  Plan on continuing to use in the future.
1,Really like my Mac Office software.  Would have given it 5 stars but there are still some minor transition issues going from fro Mac to PC.
1,I wasn't sure how I was going to like Quicken Deluxe after using Microsoft Money for so many years but it has actually been fairly easy to work with and learn the Quicken software.  I have even introduced my two teenage children to it so that they learn how to keep track of their own finances with the program.
1,Worked well so far. I also have an old xp home OS running on my laptop and seems to protect me so far.
1,Completely happy with this purchase.
0,This product stinks.  When I stop recording the program hangs and never responds again.  I wish I could return it for my money back.
1,"I have always preferred Norton products over other options.  There have been times where I had to leave NIS when they weren't doing a very good job managing their performance.  However, I like the current product and have been using it again for the past few years.<br /><br />However, with my recent purchase, when I entered my new Activation key I noticed that it said that I have &#34;352 days of coverage&#34;.  I really thought I purchased a full year of coverage with this license...."
1,Excellent
1,very good even though i haven't try the more advance features. Easy to use and user AND opcion frendly too.
1,Great!!
1,I have been using Turbotax for over a decade and could not imagine doing my taxes without it. My only complaint is that Intuit charges $19.95 plus tax to eFile your State return which is why I only gave 4 stars.
0,"I loaded it and ran it the first time and it found all sorts of drivers that needed updating.  Unfortunately, after I concluded &#34;updating&#34; the drivers, my system crashed and my mouse would not work!<br /><br />Fortunately, I had my system restore disks and one of the first drivers it loaded was the mouse driver.  I have uninstalled this, as well as LargeSoftware's PC Tune up 2012!  There was NO refund allowed, because I used the download, so try the trial option FIRST and hopefully your system won't crash."
1,"As an amateur photographer I started off with Adobe Photoshop and although it was great for photo editing and manipulating, editing a batch of photos simply took too much time and would take me forever.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Lightroom is an alternative to Photoshop because it really isn't. They both do different things and they're both great at what they do. For myself Lightroom (accompanied with Nik) is simply unbeatable and especially at the price!<br /><br />Getting accustomed to Lightroom and making your workflow efficient definitely takes a little while to get used to but once learned, becomes a great tool.<br /><br />I use LR5 pretty much in 99% of my workflow."
1,easily worth twice the price
0,NOT SURE YET
0,"I've used Quicken since the early 1990's and I purchased Quicken 2013 for the mobile app feature. In all those years and versions this is the most dissapointing version of Quicken ever. The mobile app has many problems (check out the Quicken user forums) and lacks the features that I would expect for entering transactions on a mobile device.<br /><br />Although I was able to install, sync and access the data on my mobile device (unlike a large number of other users) I'm very disappointed in the mobile app in that:<br />1- Selecting to view the current or ending balance of accounts still shows the register ending balance or, for credit accounts is seems, some very high random balance, as if it's including future payments in the balance.<br />2- There is no running balance in the account register views so you can't really follow why the balances are incorrect without consulting Quicken desktop.<br />3- When entering transactions on the mobile appp you have to keep re-selecting the account that you want to use and there doesn't seem to be a way to set a default account.<br />4- It doesn't seem to allow entry of split transaction from the mobile app.<br />5- When entering transactions you can't use the mobile camera to add a picture of the receipt along with the entry which means you still have to carry around your paper receipts and scan them in when you get back to the desktop.<br /><br />If you want to look at graphs the mobile app is very nice but I'm not looking for pretty graphics and I'm not giving presentations on my personal finances, I want usability for recording and tracking my money and this upgrade doesn't deliver.<br /><br />As far as Quicken 2013 desktop; without the mobile feattures the desktop product has almost nothing new over 2012 that would even come close to making it worth the cost of the upgrading.<br /><br />I'm planning to request my money back but first I need to figure out how to delete my Quicken data from the Quicken Cloud account that youmust setup to use the mobile app."
1,"This is a great value if you plan on keeping your GPS.  You're provided a code and you connect your GPS and download the updates.  Amazon keeps this on file as part of your digital content.  I've had my GPS and lifetime updates for over a year - my GPS recently said my maps were over a year old.  I connected it to my computer, went to the Garmin site and simply downloaded a new map.  You can download the Garmin updater software to your computer, it will also check for updates.  Well worth the money."
0,"Intuit has a monopoly in this market. Its ok, just like all of their products. They are middle grade mediocre company that somehow is the only real off the shelf solutions. Whatever."
1,"Avast is a great little program, it does not take up much space and blocks things that other programs miss."
0,"Not good. I received some K1s from investments. Upon entering them the software said I had to REMEMBER to check the 1256 straddle check box when it appeared, and enter straddle amounts manually, because it could not do this for me. There was no help filling out form 6781 at all. So I purchased TurboxTax, which I didn't want to do. I was angry TurboTax tried to gouge people this year.TurboTax did this all for me, AND TurboTax computed my tax to be over $500 less."
1,Easy to and use. Hunts down vulnerable add ons and out of date code.  Very aggressive. Have more confidence in it than other s/w we have used.
0,"I have been using HR Block since 2007. There used to be a work sheet that calculated average cost of shares if you had multiple transactions for the same stock. HR Block removed it this year. Most likely to get you to buy the premium version. Also removed is a feature at the end that showed the average tax, deduction amounts for other taxpayers in your income range. Kinda helped you see if you are way off the average. Removed."
1,"i rated this highest because it found the Taquito virus months before Nortons would even tell you it was there, i'm still paranoid and check my machine with an ad ware blocker but Avast is the best i have ever used. I use the free version but i recommend the pay one, people i know cliam it cleans your machine of EVERYTHING nasty."
0,"The program looks great, but it will not load.  It says we need a disc to load the program, but this was for a download, so there is no disc.  I've tried downloading it again, and running it multiple times, to no avail.  I emailed Amazon.com, who said to email the company that makes the program.  I emailed them several times and have had no response about how to fix the problem.  Too bad, because there are some other programs in the same line that also look good, but why spend more money to have a program we can't use.  My 8-year-old was really looking forward to using this program, and has been so disappointed it won't work."
0,"It is frustrating that it doesn't work from the download correctly. It will install and then offer to upgrade. You choices is to either upgrade or quit. When you restart to install the upgrade, it dies. So you are stuck.<br /><br />It seems to be a bum perl script. You can manually launch the upgrade by entering the following into you terminal:<br />/usr/bin/open /Volumes/Rosetta\ Stone\ TOTALe\ 4.5.5\ Update\ 2/Rosetta\ Stone\ TOTALe.pkg"
1,"I Purchased this Product and right after Activation; and after the first Live Update from the Norton Site it Downloaded the Latest Version of the Product Free!<br /><br />  I installed the Latest Version from the Download and ran the Live Update a few more times and now it is up and running on my PC, Notebook, and Netbook!<br /><br />  Just the low price alone was worth every penny I spent not to mention getting the latest version from Update Downloaded for no more money!<br /><br />  The finished product works well and continues to function as advertised.  This is a Great Amazon Sale!"
1,"everything I purchase from Amazon is just what the ad describes, and I have had no problems with returns on anything. Cannot complain at all."
0,"I have used TurboTax Basic for well over 20 years, and it has been great.  My wife owns a 0.00000xxx percent of an oil well that last year<br />produced $0.52 of royalties income.  Now I find that Basic no longer includes schedule D and I have to pay $54.00 for  Premier to report this income.  Guess I'll try H&R block Basic this year and skip TurboTax.<br /><br />P.S. They tried to sweeten the pot by including State filing, but since I live in TX that is of no value either."
0,"Used online backup. Laptop died and was looking to restore files. Spent HOURS. Tried online chat - 90 minute wait for a rep. She did not read my problem summary, was handling multiple clients at once, and then proceeded to tell me  how to perform a backup not RESTORE a backup. GIVES YOU FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. Will never use this product again"
1,Easy to install from Amazon.  Lots of changes from my old Office Program.  You will need some time to play with this program.
1,"Having some problems with word, but for the most part this has worked as advertised."
0,Never did e-mail the federal or State returns.  Stopped at last  point and never corrected an oversight
1,I have been using Norton products for many years and have never had a problem with infection.
0,"* see update below  -  one of the other reviewers said it best - The Service reps are hard to understand, so one has to wonder if they really even understand what you are saying to them? - I asked a rep about a feature we were looking for, and having QuickBooks Pro 2011, she assured me that the feature was available in QB Pro 2012 - and that I could upgrade for the special price she could authorize for me (it wasn't any special price - and when I told her I found a cheaper upgrade price on the QB website, she said I could have it for that price) - that should have been my first red flag - but did I pay attention? - NO - I upgraded - could not get the server to run, had to call QB support, and within 45 minutes, Support figured out the problem -  BUT - that's just the start -  since March 14, I have spent a total of 6 hours on the phone with support, was told I would get call backs, and, thankfully my life is not depending on this, because I am still waiting for the call backs!!! -  the last call back was supposed to happen Friday, April 23 between 1 - 3 PM, today is Monday April 23, 4:30PM, and I'M STILL WAITING!!!<br />UPDATE APRIL 24th 1:15 PM -  after sending out this review, and sending an email to intuit at an email address that was referenced in another reviewer's email, I actually got a response from QuickBooks, and while they still were not able to help me with the feature that I had initially asked about, they actually did ease the frustration a bit, which I found helpful - at last!"
1,Great
1,"received this product by download and am happy with it.  Works as described and no problems with set up or use.  Still not able to network, but that is my problem, not the program - I think.  Really good at reminders and prints many sizes, etc."
1,"Works as advertised, installation was easy."
0,I am new to the product so i realize i would have some challenges...that said...it its not as simple to use i had expected...did a 30 day trial with QuickBooks and WOW there was a huge difference...do not like quicken.
0,"I bought this package to make a short video presentation: pics + videos + voice over it.<br />It kinda works, but<br /><br />when my project grew over just two short video clips, the program started crashing every hour or so.<br />a lot of the screen space is wasted on the library of the project media, but the timeline is small and difficult to navigate.<br />it does not let you move the clips on the timeline with any precision, instead it snaps them onto seemingly arbitrary points - REALLY ANNOYING<br />fades in between the clips are buggy - video can start jerking.<br />it does not store the media in the project: if you added a clip to the project and then renamed the file, the project will loose it.<br />it can not open flash files directly<br />it can not open TIFF pictures<br /><br />All in all, the software is just not tested well enough, too many bugs."
1,I almost didn't buy this based on several of the negative reviews but I'm glad i did. I have just converted all my childhood 8mm movies to digital and being over 50 years old they needed a lot of help. The levels function combined with the color correction do a great job of making the clips usable. This may not be software for the professional but I'm impressed with it's capability for people like myself.
1,"I've used Turbotax for a long time...off and on over maybe 15 or more years. It was fine until Intuit took over. It's been buggy and complex ever since. I also felt they ignored Mac users. This year was the final straw with their hidden fees. This is my first time using H&R Block and I have to say I was impressed. Very simple, no bugs. It worked the first time and I didn't have to constantly download new versions. I filed both my State and Federal returns electronically."
1,"very powerful product , and easy to configure"
1,Does not slow my computer and ignores my Microsoft Docs when I open them. (Or at least scans very fast.)  This is a first.
1,"As my business continued to grow, I needed a better solution for keeping my books.  I had researched a few different options but ultimately chose QuickBooks to use.  Keeping my books up to date has been easy and efficient.  Connecting the program to my bank account allows me to quickly categorize all expenses.  I really love that I can access it from any device too!"
0,"I have upgraded various Office products since before they were called &#34;Office&#34;, for example back when Lotus was superior to Excel when the latter first came on the market.  I have likely spent thousands on the initial product and its upgrades.  Now it looks like I will spend $100 a year into eternity for this, which is not all that much improved, based on my usage patterns.  365 has new features that I will never use.  Not fond of storing client docs in the SkyDrive cloud, which may even be malpractice in my profession (legal)."
1,PLAN TO PURCHASE SOON/. BOB
1,This is the only way to purchase and use Norton.  The cost per unit is  less than $10 per.  Even if you don't have 10 computers I bet your neighbors would love you for including them.  Meet a neighbor!
1,comodo is the best
0,Won't work. I think I've tried all of the recommended fixes and it still won't load. Wasted money.
1,"An excellent and free anti-virus program. For pure anti-virus purposes, nothing beats avast. I have used AVG, Norton/Symantec, and MSE but avast is my a/v of choice. It installs cleanly, you can leave behind anything you don't need or want, and once installed, it does the work it's supposed to do, simply and efficiently.    Avast has multiple \\""shields,\\"" its term for things like file protection, web surfing, email (incoming and outgoing), and browser site phishing management. Any of these can be turned off if you don't want or need them. Avast will also scan your system for any add-ons you may use (e.g. Flashplayer, Shockwave, VLC media player) and alert you when newer releases are available. It will help you download those newer versions if you elect to do so. This can be turned off if you prefer updating on your own schedule.    Since Microsoft has ended support of WinXP, it's comforting to know avast continues to run on XP, and reportedly will continue to do so for some time. There are plenty of WinXP systems in use, so that's a real benefit.    All those are \\""pro\\"" statements, so here are the \\""cons.\\"" I do wish there were a way to set avast to update its signatures at certain times, rather than after certain periods (i.e., nightly at midnight rather than every 30 minutes or 240 minutes or whatever you may set it to). Perhaps there is such a way, but I haven't discovered it. Also, related to this, if you don't leave your computer on all the time (as I do) then each time you start up, avast downloads its newest signatures. This makes the system sluggish while doing so, although it's fine afterwards.    Additionally, avast pops up occasional messages to the effect, \\""Wouldn't you like to upgrade to a paid version with additional features?\\"" That's understandable -- there would be no free version if they never sold anything -- but you can also turn this messaging off, so perhaps it's unfair to label this a \\""con\\"" feature.    All the messages have a 20-second default display, but you can reduce this to zero if you like.    Despite the small negatives, avast is an excellent watchdog for your system. I use it on all three of my home systems, and thanks to avast's policy of providing it free to schools, we use it where I work as well (thanks, avast, for having the corporate social thoughtfulness for doing that; it keeps us legal AND functionally protected).    Avast also has extensions to the basic a/v software which provide additional internet and network security, if you are looking for something like that. I don't use those additional applications, so I can't speak to their utility but if you're seeking pure a/v software, this is the one to have."
0,"I've been using Photoshop for over 17 years. Now that I can't OWN it (or at least have a &#34;perpetual license&#34;), you'd better believe I'm looking elsewhere for other programs to meet my needs. I've watched Adobe adjust their pricing model. Now you can get PS for 9.99 a month but what happens if you can't pay for it one month? You are screwed. Oops, sorry, you can't work on your project until you shell out some more cash. 9.99 doesn't sound like a lot, but if you need more than one Adobe product for your project(s), as I often do (HEY ADOBE do you just hate Illustrator users or Dreamweaver or InDesign users??? Where is the 9.99 subscription model for those as independent programs??) - it adds up. If you can't pay, you can't open your files. At least with CS6, if I'm having a lean month (or year), I can still work on my projects. I'm not a corporate customer. I'm just a homeschooling mom who uses Adobe products to make a few extra bucks for my family.<br /><br />I've read the comments by Mr. Tranberry, the Adobe employee, who is trying to put a little bit of a positive spin on all of these negative reviews and is mentioning how you can have PS for 9.99 a month for 6 to 8.5 years as compared to the original price. The point that isn't being brought up though is the fact that you LOSE access to your work if you can't pay. That is the huge difference, at least for me, that makes this a no-go. Now I do not have control over my files. Adobe does. I can work 5 months on something, have an emergency during the 6th month where every penny counts (and hence not be able to pay the subscription fee) or WHATEVER the reason and that's just too bad for me. I have to stop my work and wait until I can pay again. If something happens and I can't pay for Adobe in the future, as it is, I can still open up my files and even work on them because I have CS6. However, if I moved to the subscription model, if my subscription dies, I can't do anything with my files.<br /><br />I've also read about subscribers having problems with the Internet based license checking and disasters when edits were needed to be made away from an Internet connection. I've read about others who've had problems with the billing system and if you've ever had to get help from Adobe customer support - you can imagine what kind of nightmare that must have been (I've had that nightmare before -don't ever want to go through it again). I don't want any HASSLE using Photoshop and other Adobe programs. I also don't want to deal with security issues either, etc. Oh, and did you know that everyone was locked out of their Adobe IDs in May of this year (2014)? You can Google that. People got kicked off the Adobe Cloud system and then couldn't log in at all. While waiting for customer support in chat it was suggested to one of them that he go and check the online support forums. But guess what? He couldn't log in because you need your Adobe ID to post to the forums, LOL OH WOW NO THANKS (btw brilliant and helpful advice there!). Google the article by Alistair Dabbs (The article: &#34;Cloud computing is FAIL and here's why&#34;). Now what are you supposed to do when you NEED to make a change for a client right then and there? Too bad for you. You have to wait for Adobe to iron out their technical issues. Hmmmm, I never had that problem using my out-of-the box Adobe programs - or even the latest version of CS6 that I downloaded that didn't even come out of a box. I installed my programs and they worked and if Adobe was having technical problems or security issues, it certainly didn't affect me or my work.<br /><br />Mr. Tranberry also mentions how they are moving to this model to make sure that customers can keep up with the fast changing technology landscape. How about allowing your customers to CHOOSE to keep up. Not all of us get to buy a new OS every 12 months. I've been sitting here with the same computer for over 5 years. I also haven't seen any earth shattering upgrades to the program...some are nice (like getting to see the changing typography as you mouse over fonts), but not worth having the scary thought that I could lose access to my work if something happens. Also, some of us know how to delay gratification and don't need the latest and greatest every 2 seconds. It's nice, but it's not necessary. Upgrading is also not always a good thing. Sometimes upgrades bring about compatibility issues or other problems. I read that some Adobe users experienced a huge slow-down in some Creative Cloud apps when they upgraded to OSX Mavericks.<br /><br />I'm hanging on to CS6 as long as I possibly can and waiting for other companies to come up with something that will allow me to ditch Photoshop all together. I hate being FORCED to go to this subscription model. Adobe should still at least allow BOTH options. I don't know whose brilliant idea it is to ignore the huge amount of people asking just for a CHOICE - one they could EASILY provide.  From an article online: &#34; ...it doesn't appear as though Adobe is worried, not about their competitors actions or their own initial loss of customers. This, even as their net income for the 2013 fiscal year fell to $290 million (on revenue of 4.1 billion) from $833 million (on revenue of 4.4 billion) in the previous year.&#34; Adobe is just playing the waiting game and waiting for this to all blow over and for us to get used to (or have to) start sucking from their subscription bottle. I hope they keep losing net income until someone in management gets their head out of their...aspirin...I need an aspirin for the headache I'm getting over this. ;-)<br /><br />At least I'm not completely out of options...and am hoping more appear before too long.<br />One product I've found that is actually superior, at least for the type of illustration I do, is Manga Studio. It's more responsive, the inking brushes are beautiful (especially if you obtain the brushes made by Frenden), there is NO lag and it can do many of the same things Photoshop can do. Oh, and it only costs 29.99 and then you can keep using it....forever! I'm not joking about the price. Try the free trial and see how amazing it is! Hopefully they keep developing it and taking on more PS type tasks.<br />I do admit that it still can't do everything I need PS for (which is still, unfortunately the best for what it does) but it's only a matter of time until some other software appears that will offer some serious competition - hopefully without this subscription nonsense or at least OPTIONS for their customers.<br /><br />It's so upsetting is that Adobe simply does NOT CARE about the uproar they've received from long-time customers who want at least the option to purchase the software outright and not be tied to the cloud and have to &#34;check in&#34; with the mother ship. They know that they are the best right now for what they do and they are just waiting for us all to come around and give in.<br /><br />Don't bow down to the Adobe subscription model. Grab CS6 if you absolutely have to have PS like I do at this point (get it before you can't - it's already scarce from what I can tell) and wait it out with the rest of us who've been kicked to the curb. I love Photoshop. I use it almost every day (CS6 version).

1,"Every year, the annual payroll subscription in QuickBooks has to be renewed with a purchase.  You can buy this on Amazon for much less than Intuit would charge you (usually an automatic charge and renewal unless you stop it).  On Amazon, buy the current year’s “QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll” and you will get a Product Number and a License Number.  To use these, you first have to remove your current (expired or about to expire) payroll service, using these steps:  1) go to the Home page in QuickBooks, 2) Hit CTRL-K on keyboard, 3) On the subsequent “service keys” window, select the service and click the “remove” button to remove the old payroll service key.  After doing this, your QuickBooks looks like it has no payroll service, and you can follow the instructions provided with your new “QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll” purchase.  In short, the instructions are to go to the top-level &#34;Employees&#34; menu, then the &#34;Payroll&#34; submenu, and select the &#34;Install Payroll from Box&#34; option.  The menus don't look like that if you already have a payroll subscription, which is one reason why you have to remove your current subscription first.<br /><br />Note that you will need your Intuit account (usually an email address) and password to finish the installation, but there is a button to help with people who forgot their password.  I’d advise trying to log into Intuit beforehand to ensure you have the right password.<br /><br />As of 2014, Intuit makes you keep a valid credit card on file by means of requiring a monthly automatic charge of $2 per employee, for all employees after the first one.  The purchased “QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll” only covers one employee, so if you have more, there is a monthly charge, which means you have to give them a credit card to use.  This will make it more difficult to avoid getting the large annual renewal from Intuit, so you’ll have to set up a reminder to such to go through the manual process of removing the about-to-expire subscription and buying a new one from Amazon at a much lower cost, using the above instructions.<br /><br />You shouldn't need to call Intuit for help, using the instructions above.  However, if you do need help:<br /><br />Amazon had this as the Intuit help desk phone number:  1-888-729-1996<br />My QuickBooks had this:  1-888-446-8848"
1,Turbo Tax is a great software package that lets even novices do their own taxes.  The package includes a state tax program so that you can do both the Federal and State tax returns.  The premier edition includes software to help prepare returns that include rental property income.  It's deductible is also helpful for putting a value on clothing and household items for non-cash contributions.
1,"In the past I have always gotten a free state return with the purchase of TurboTax. This was, however, the first time I downloaded the software. Apparently I assumed too much and/or didn't read carefully, but I was extremely disappointed to have to purchase the state return. Will look for ways around this in the future.<br /><br />As far as the software itself, I have used it for years without problem and happy with it."
0,They goof this thing up every time they have a new release.  They make you buy it every 3 years under the guise that they can't support the old download format.  This is complete poppycock.  I work for a bank.  We haven't changed our Direct Connect in 10 years.<br /><br />No new useful features.  Just more bloat and cost.  Unfortunately I'm stuck with them due to the enormous history in my database.

1,Purchased Xara Web Designer 10 Premium download a year ago. Have been offered the upgrade to Ver. 11 at the upgrade price. Trying to purchase the product at the upgrade price proved impossible! Xara sales would not upgrade after I furnished proof of purchase and my download log to their on-line customer service Rep. The Rep made me feel like I was trying to take advantage of Xara!! Would not by from this company again.
1,"So i bought this software with the hopes of being more organized with my personal finances and business finances (I started a digital/print media company and a single member day trading company). When I downloaded it, I almost was going to request a refund because I couldn't get it installed, I had doubled checked my computer before I bought it to make sure that I had the requirements (I'm a Comp Sci major mind you) and still couldn't get it to install. But if I would have paid attention to the steps to install it on a Windows 7 computer, it would have been hours instead of days to get this to working. Now its up and running, all of my business and personal accounts are loaded, sync and I have the app on my iPhone to keep my updated on the go. I just wish my personal bank would accept the direct web connect but that's their problem not Intuit."
0,"I bought H&R's product this year because Intuit was playing games with their version this  year.  But the software is just o.k. for me.  It works but there are a few things that could make it better.  1) TurboTax has a thing that for any field you can double click and pull up a &#34;notes&#34; or documentation list.  I found that to be really handy in putting my notes in for a particular item (especially since I have to look the stuff up, by having that I can note where I got the number or what backup/check #/credit card etc I used).  2) I have a large number of investment trades and I couldn't find any easy way to print a summary of these to review off line.  In TurboTax I can print out the D1 form (as it would be filed/printed) which summarizes each transaction on a single line.  In the H&R product it seems to only be able to print 3 or 4 per page and almost an endless &#34;COPY 1 COPY2 COPY 3&#34; drop down menu.  3) The H&R product as a &#34;Shoebox&#34; button but I found this to be just a glorified &#34;goto&#34;/menu list for a variety of topics.  It'd be nice if it could be a virtual shoebox for my receipts/statements that I could add to &#34;my shoebox&#34;.  4) Also in TurboTax, there is a &#34;bookmark&#34; type feature that allowed you to mark any page that you'd want to come back to later (as a reminder - it could even add it to your calendar).  I didn't find anything like that in the H&R product.  I've used TurboTax for decades and so was familiar with various features.  Finally, TurboTax has It's Deductible for donation items you have.  It's a separate web site that imports into TurboTax.  The H&R Tax Software has Deduction Pro built into the software.  It's also ok, not great.  I like the It's Deductible web site better because it's a web site and you don't have to fire up your tax software to enter items you donate (plus also you can enter the stuff you donate now for the next tax period; whereas you just have to save all those items when you buy H&R's product next year).  I switched from TurboTax because of the games Intuit was playing with their crippled &#34;Deluxe&#34; software.  They've sent various apologies and supposedly have &#34;corrected&#34; their misdeeds.  We'll see how things go next year.  I might switch back."
1,I have been using TurboTax fosr the last 8 years and it certainly beats doing taxes by hand.  It usually takes me about 20 minutes to finish my taxes and then I wait until the middle of April to send in my payment.  The program actually cost less this year than last year.  Takes the pain away form doing this annual chore.
1,"Quicken 2013 worked OK for me, but I waited until version 11 before updating from Quicken 2012.<br /><br />As an improvement, I would like to be able to export to Excel, so I can sort and filter the numbers a little bit more."
0,"Next year I am going to definitely switch to H&R Block's software program. Like most people, I was suckered into buying the Deluxe version only to find out that I needed the Premium version. After I upgraded for $35, Intuit offered to refund me $25 for having to upgrade. Only problem was I had to call a number and that number kept getting disconnected...hmmm. Wonder if it is just another trick by Intuit? Never have received my $25. Anyway, I am finished with Intuit and their dishonest tactics. Please join me in switching to H&R Block next year and show Intuit they cannot continue to screw people over.  Update 3-9-15 As of today, still have not heard from TurboTax about my rebate even though I have an Incident ID#"
0,"Had I known there was no noticeable difference between 2013 and 2014 editions, I would not have bought the 2014 version.  Keep 2013 and save the money."
1,"I have been using Avast for the past 4 years, very pleased with the product.  Can't beat it for free!"
0,I think its one of the worst out there! Messed up my laptop big time!
1,"Absolutely awesome and really fun to use. I was surprised just how easy it was to learn the editor and create some loops and music. I used it to create background music for a video game but I'd imagine it'd be easy to write entire symphonies on this as well as 10 second background loops. For the price, if you are into creating music electronically, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Also, if you are wondering if you can just make funky techno or stuff like that, it is definitely not limited to that at all. There are a slew of traditional instruments as well as modern. You could even write modern rock music or acoustic music. Pretty much anything you can think of if you acquire the correct sounds/instruments to work with. The defaults are quite extensive as is too, so you can jump right in making music."
1,"Quicken has been a big help for our family.  My only complaint is that it is sometimes a little flakey with the automatic download from one of my banks.  Maybe it is a problem on the banks side, but I regularily have to do the download manually - not that big of a deal though.  really a great product."
1,Good product! Good price!
1,"Excellent , easy to follow, accomplished my task sucessfully."
1,Good light and Easy to install. Also cheap
1,I love the avg ultimate and the pc tuner
1,This product does not slow down my PC performance and always stays up to date. It always blocks website with may have a threat to my PC. It is user friendly and price is great.
0,I am unable to download the software after several attempts.
1,"I write long, technical reports for a living.  Microsoft dominated the word processing market with &#34;Word&#34; years ago but I have remained a devoted WP fan.  There really is little comparison in terms of user friendliness and intuitive operation.  I just needed to add WP to a laptop and could not locate my older version so I bought this.  I don't see a lot of difference between this and the older (4) version I had been using.  WordPerfect is a very good and easy to use word processing program."
1,"I have had Avast for several years now and it was always the home edition.  When I found the 2014 edition I jumped on it.  I now have it installed on my desktop, and 2 laptops because for some reason the laptops seem more accessible to hackers and since I am in school and I am using my daughters laptop I want the best protection I can get.  Not only for peace of mind but also in the knowledge that I am doing the best that  I can for other systems in my home.  I am really pleased with Avast.  This program in the past saved my desktop system on more than one occasion."
0,I have been unimpressed with the last 2 upgrades of Quicken since 2013.  The app is nice for logging receipts into my desktop software but I'm still having the same problems with my balances not coming out right or loosing my data while I'm updating my accounts.  Once Quicken has found an answer to these problems I can once again trust the software.  I would like to say though that I really appreciate the price I received on the<br />Amazon.com website.  The savings makes the purchase for an upgrade like this a no-brainer.
0,This was not compatible with my OS. Did not work well with explorer
1,It has met my expectations it is good and still works that's what's up I would purchase it again if needed
1,"I've had alot of free Antivirus software, all of which don't offer complete coverage on certain levels, however anything you could ask of an Antivirus is provided with avast!"
1,I needed a cost effective but reliable product that could give the protection I needed for the multiple devices I had at home. I am glad we found this product. It was very easy to download and configure across multiple devices and is working well. The product we had earlier was a decent one but wasn't a multi PC option and hence costed a lot more to cover 3 devices.
1,We have used Norton 360 for years and have great results keeping our computer clean.<br />I like how we can purchase 1 copy for the home computers
1,"Either one is easy to use but chose H&R Block because it is less costly.  However, do not like their required password format for communicating with them.  Opted not to communicate.  Tax computes OK just the same."
0,"What ROB CHENG of PC-Matic / PC PitStop LLC isn't telling you and is using false and misleading advertizing about is that the results of the Virus Bulleting RAP TEST August 2014 says that his product found 345+ False Positives, meaning that the product thinks 345+ items in the test were thought to contain a VIRUS and were MIS-Identified as having a virus. Below is a screen capture of the RESULTS of that TEST.<br /><br />I have attached a copy of their current website page saying they blew away the competition, when in fact, they are FALSELY claiming this as I have also attached a copy of the actual Virus Bulletin RAP TEST results. They aren't even on it. They FAILED again !"
1,Have PC Matic installed on 4 machines.  Totally trustworthy. The software is so complete - you just sit back and let it work!  You will be extremely pleased with the results.  Faster machines with no bugs at all!
1,"Fast, easy download. Easy to use software. Many options for video file types. If you need to convert video files into different formats, I'd recommend it."
1,"This software is &#34;almost&#34; intuitive.  It took a while, but I finally have it organized the way I need it to be in order to move from stacks of papers and receipts to a paperless home environment."
0,"I'm a longtime Quicken user with a huge data base built up over many years.  The program is critical to me.  Recently I was forced to upgrade from the 2007 program, which had worked very beautifully. For additional revenue reasons, Intuit has now decided to obsolete it's previous programs. It's so disturbing to discover that the &#34;upgrade&#34; 2015 edition is an unmitigated disaster.  My faith in Intuit has been badly shaken.  So many bugs and unanticipated inconveniences in the new program, it's difficult to know where to begin.  Soon after downloading, I found myself trying to find help from Intuit and ran into another sad reality.  Either Intuit has hired only a handful of support people; or, the volume of dissatisfied Quicken 2015 customers is so enormous they are unable to respond in an acceptable way.  I suspect the latter. The wait time is typically over an hour.  Wish I had a good suggestion for current Quicken customers.  If you are treated like me, you will be forced to buy their new product, like it or not, or be unable to use critical features of older versions -- like on-line communication with your bank accounts.  For potential new customers who are looking to start their experience with Quicken 2015, my advice is to stay away!"
1,"I upgrade from Quicken Deluxe 2014, not for the new features (let's face it... there really aren't any), but for the bug fixes and improvements. While the bug fixes here should have been applied to Quicken 2014 they weren't so I waited for a sale to upgrade. I never would pay Intuit full price to fix what should have been fixed for free, but for $30 the cost was more manageable and, from what I've seen so far, I won't need to upgrade again for a couple years.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Quicken 2014 was how sluggish it was, shortcuts weren't standard, and if you wanted to approve a matched or new transaction the program would sometimes get stuck. Quicken 2014 was very problematic and it's nice to see these things fixed in 2015."
0,This product would not download and kept saying &#34;error code&#34;.  I tried 10 times to download it.  I would like a full refund for this order.  I ordered it previously and it downloaded fine.  There was something wrong with this download and I want my money back!
0,I don't remember the details of this but it's just like the other tax software they charge for them to complete the state taxes.
1,I have used turbo tax for several years and have been satisifed with the product.  Plan on using it again in the future.
0,"Wow, Mr. Meighan, do you really see your customers as mindless, one-cell organisms? If you have a public relations and/or marketing department, you should have consulted them.  If you did consult them, they should be fired!  Raise the price of your product if you must, I'm used to it.  But do not insult me, too. Your gobbledy gook explanation was insulting and demeaning to all of us who use TT (and, by the way, sounds like complete B.S). You might want to consider adding a writing coach to your staff. Probably the worst rollout of a new or &#34;improved&#34; product ever."
1,Everything including the download went smoothly and the key worked flawlessly.  The price is fair for what is expected of a Microsoft product.
1,"I liked the ease of downloading the H&R Block tax program.  This is a great product that I've been using for several years.....easy to use with great \\""help\\"" when needed."
1,"I have been a user of QB for over 20 years and just recently upgraded to 2013 MAC version. Having been a PC user since inception, I waited almost a year before I upgraded QB because I needed to get to know MAC :)  I am so happy with the upgrade and ease of use (wishing I had not waited so long).  I am a finance manager for a number of different types of businesses with each one having its own uniqueness so I can truthfully say I understand QB in every aspect.  I use MAC at home for several small business accounts I manage while I used 2013 PRO for Windows for HVAC company and last I use 2012 Enterprise for a small non-profit. business. OF ALL THE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS, I LOVE THE MAC version the best!  Thanks for helping me manage the art of multiple accounting with ease all these years!! Looking forward to many more."
0,I just needed to print a return that I already paid to do on this software. Its complicated for no reason and dosent inform you that it wont open files with state returns on them unless you buy the state ad on......another $40......just to print something I already paid for. Useless garbage from a useless company with a poor description......DO NOT USE THIS
0,Just be sure to read the Product Information before you Purchase!!! STATE IS A EXTRA $20 to file !!! At least in Idaho.
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for years and find it to be the best and easiest to use. I have tried one or two others but still ended up filing with Turbo Tax. I find the wording to be stright forward and in laymans terms that we can understand. Not looking for tax time, but will be looking for the 2013 version when time comes."
1,"Love all the features, especially the mobile sync...allows you to track and enter your information on the go...couldn't ask for better program."
0,Good  product but installing was a pain! Never had an issue with the cd but the digital version was a real pain. Hours of wasted time. Not sure why it was different. We always buy a new cd each year since it's cheaper than renewing. This year we bought a digital download.  No step popped up to add product code. And then it kept telling us we had one day left (obviously from the old subscription) but even after the old was deleted.

1,"Excellent.  User friendly.  If you are computer literate and have all of your taxable receipts organized, you will really appreciate this program. You must be willing to read and follow instructions.  Seek answers to questions that you do not understand.  It helps you to get the best refund."
0,"This review applies only to the business part of this product. I did not use the individual component.<br /><br />I installed the software on a 32-bit system with no problems. According to other reviewers, installation can be a problem on 64-bit systems.<br /><br />A lot of people seemed to have display issues, but the graphics worked just fine on my machine. I found the interface to be cumbersome, though.<br /><br />PDF generation was problematic. Numerous pages of the return were incomprehensible. What good is the software if it can't produce a paper return and can't file electronically?<br /><br />Software and form updates were easy, but the program is slow.<br /><br />Overall, I found the program frustrating to use. I gave up on it and did the returns by hand. A lot of the steps in the interview involve filling out a form by yourself, anyway."
1,"I choose this rating because Avast has blocked several attempts from Trojans and other malware from infecting my computer. Also, it was the highest rated free anti virus software."
1,"My anti software expired and I found this download for $16.22.  To buy it in the box was $69.99 (McAfee's sale price).  The download was a no brainier.  As for McAfee, it has protected 3 of my pc's for several years now.  I would buy again next time my subscription expires."

0,"Huge waste of money for me.  HUGE!  Claims you do not need any accounting experience and all of that....well, that is a total load of BS!  Definitely not for people who are clueless about accounting...big waste of money!  I was hoping that my computer skills would be enough to guide me thru prompts....however, nothing prompts you in the right direction....you need experience."
0,It didn't work as well as they last one. It turned of internet explore and add more damage to other programs do not buy it.
1,"I must say to all of you who left the ranks of TurboTax customers this year, Thanks!  I too left for a competitor this year due to pricing tactics of Intuit, but came back after getting very confused and frustrated with the other package.  Yes, I purchased two software packages.  Time became money to me.  Or rather, I spent a whole frustrating day of vacation trying to get the other package to work.  That was a valuable experience however and now I have no qualms about paying the extra dollars for TurboTax.  A very helpful and knowledgeable support employee (Maria) helped me through a tough problem and convinced me that Intuit was taking the loss of customers to heart and will be a better company because of it.  I won't say who the competitor is, but will say that they are in the top 3.  Briefly, TurboTax (Premier Edition) shines brighter due to shorter support waits, more informed staff, ease of use, ample sized password field for importing data and more.  Examples of ease of use include 1)  right click to show where an item on a form comes from, 2) Help links right on the entry form to the most common questions, 3) getting to and from the tax forms."
0,"After I installed this SW, my PC crashed. I have to recover my system and install every SW again. I deserve a compensation on buying it."
1,I love Turbo Tax. It works beautifully. I have been an avid customers for several years now. I also use the small business software as well.
0,"First - 2-Stars due to the hassle of just getting it working.    Right out of the gate I ran into a Windows XP problem where it would not import TurboTax .tax2013 data.    1. Phone Support, after an hour listening to music and propaganda I spoke with a very polite person.  But it took her :20 minutes to \\""realize\\"" that it is \\""a known issue with no known work around and no estimated time-to-fix\\"".    2. Online \\""chat\\"" started me in a queue at position 192. After 4 hours and 49 minutes it was my turn (I actually waited just to see how long it would take!)    The solution? I received a free MAC download, transferred my .tax2013 file from the PC to my MAC, successfully imported on the MAC then transferred the H&RB file back to the PC.    How does it compare to TurboTax. I believe that TurboTax would have successfully imported it's 2013 tax data."
0,"I strongly suggest you think twice about installing this on your computer. It just caused the first crash I've ever experienced on my laptop. And now that I am uninstalling it, I am discovering that it is an extremely slow process.<br /><br />I now know to never trust anything released by Avast."
1,I have been using Turbo tax business for over 10 yrs now. easy and by pass CPA and their fees.
1,"We have been running both Quicken and Quickbooks on a PC. So, when I bought my Mac,  I bought Parallels to allow me to  run Windows software in a virtual window. This works okay but I have found that Quicken runs A LOT  faster in a native environment. Transferring my Windows data to the Mac OS10 environment was seamless. I would encourage Mac users who are using Quicken in a Windows environment to check out the Mac version of Quicken. YMMY"
1,"I am upset at Quickens marketing.  There website says the state is additional... I bought this version today and when I got to the state it said that one state is included for free.  Just like always.  The program downloaded ok (after I installed the Amazon downloader) It worked Ok... and was about the same as other years.  I don't think there marketing is doing them any good!  But,  I was happy with the way things turned out.  If people have been tricked into paying for the state... that is just wrong."
1,I was in a bind as I needed a copy of this software ASAP. The download process with Amazon was so easy the entire process took less than an hour. I was able to process my client's bookkeeping and enjoy using this version of QuickBooks. The program allows user the option of entering limited information as well as much more if needed.
1,Worked like it should and got the job done. Did not expect much more especially considering the awesome price (half of the physical copy) that amazon had on this. Bonus points for the green factor of being able to download this product.
0,We had the old crayola art that our grandchildren.  It got lost changing computers. This new version is not near as simple or interactive as the old version.  In fact it is downright hard to use.  I am sorry that I paid to download it.
0,"I could not even get this program to load properly, and there was no help available.  It was a total waste of time and money.  Stay clear."
0,This program does not work on Mac OS 10.7 and it is audacious that I can't return it. I have never been so disappointed with Amazon!
1,"This is the second year that I have purchased the Downloadable Turbo Tax and it has worked great both times.  I was able to download the program easily, and I am VERY technologically challenged.  I was able to pull last year's information through with no problems.  The program did kick me out very quickly at first when I clicked off the software and tried to go to my bank's site to pull some tax information, but once I went back to Turbo Tax and saved the return I was working on I did not have that problem again.  It worked great and I will definitely be purchasing this again next year."
0,Quicken itself is fine but if you have a question or need a service its really difficult to deal with them. I found their chat system has really improved things and this tool makes dealing with Quicken much much better.
1,Down load was tough. I had to uninstall older version and turn off antivirus.
1,Really made tax prep easy for 2014. I am a happy camper and will be buying every year.
1,We are consultants and developers that may be on the road for long periods of time. QB Online allows us to share information and keep records up to date far more easily than we have in the past.
1,"The product is working great, gets rid of unwanted files so that I don't have to worry about.<br /><br />Will purchase the latest version when this one expires"
1,"I have never used a better security software, Its simple and functional and it catches tons of things all the time. I feel very safe and secure with this software. I highly recommend it."
1,"I struggled with this program at first because I had used the ancient version for so long.  Once I learned where the new button was and how to add a check (yes, I still write perhaps one check a month for my church tithing), and I learned how to bring in transactions from my credit union it is a breeze to use.<br /><br />Thanks, Quicken!  I was drug kicking and screaming into the new age, but it has worked very well."
0,"I thought I'd try this since it was on sale for 25$....a waste of money in my opinion and I can't take it back.  It's not intuitive to me and is not worth the effort of figuring it out. If you already have windows movie maker just \\""make do\\"" and save your money for something better.  I just wanted to edit, that is cut out portions of video....after fooling around for over an hour still couldn't find a way to do it.  Should've bought Adobe."
1,"Every time I want to work on piano I just hook my keyboard up to my laptop and pick up from where I left off. I do not have to waste time trying to figure out what to work on.<br /><br />If you want to learn a few songs so that you can impress some people then this software is not for you, but if you want to actually learn the piano then this software is for you. The interactive feedback is great. It's like having your own personal teacher."
0,changing it so you can't do mutual funds or stocks was a very bad move--before that I thought it was great
0,"This seems easy enough to use for my relatively simple taxes. It prompted a few times to upgrade to another edition when I entered some investments and a rental property, but after the prompts, took the information and apparently worked fine. (My investments are simple, and my single rental property doesn't have any complexities this year.)<br /><br />I was disappointed to find that there is an additional $19.99 charge to e-file state taxes. The &#34;State&#34; in the product title only means that it will do the state calculations for you. This is described somewhere on the product page, but I didn't read that far and mistakenly assumed the title meant something else. Not a product issue, but rather a recommendation to read the whole page :)"
0,"I have been a Turbo Tax user almost since its first release, but after reading the negative reviews for this year's Turbo Tax Deluxe edition, I decided to try out H&R Block. I used it to prepare my elderly father-in-law's very simple return using all manual inputs and it worked fine. In fact I liked some of the layout and quality of explanations better than Turbo Tax. I then tried it for my somewhat more complicated return and immediately ran into problems trying to automatically import financial information from my bank and investment companies (e.g., 1099-INT, dividends, etc). The software would not make any connection regardless of the institution that I tried. I contacted H&R Block tech support for help via chatline. After about a 15 minute wait, a tech support person came on line and said she was researching the issue based on the information I had submitted. Several minutes passed, and I asked if she was still there. She said yes, that she was still researching the issue. Another 10 minutes went by with no feedback so I typed another prompt. The tech support person then asked me what version of the software I was using (which was part of the information I had supplied to initiate the chat in the first place). I responded. Then after several more minutes, the recommended response was to disable my firewalls and virus protection to run the software. Against my better judgment I did that and received the same error. I then reinstated my firewalls and virus protection, went back to Amazon, and purchased Turbo Tax, which had remedied (at least for this year) the issues that caused the earlier negative reviews. It worked like a champ, including importing the information from my financial institutions. So I will likely be using Turbo Tax next year as well."
0,"With high hopes based on hearsay, Oops!  I wasted my money.  I thought I'd be able to capture video and make DVD's with ease.  Wrong!  This is a buggy program with lots of good features that work but too many that don't.  I've wasted hours of time and ten or so DVD's.  What's wrong?  The video and voice are out of sync.  A complaint to support got an acknowledgement of this being a known problem and a download fix.  Next DVD after fix applied, same problem.  Also, the option to burn an.iso file in order to make additional DVD copies in the future often fails, with an error message.  And more.  As I said, there are editing features that work well, and I think this could be a good program.  But right now (Jan. 2015) it is not.  I expected performance like from ProShow Gold editing (a fine program for making slide presentations) but where ProShow is something you can count on for good results, Movari Screen Capture and Video Editor is very lacking for my needs.  I you want to copy recipes like one reviewer is doing I think you'd be satisfied.  If you want to capture and edit videos, my suggestion is that you get a trial copy before you commit your money.  Maybe you'll like what you get but you won't be stuck like I am."
0,it promts you to claim deductions that may be a red flag. also software rounds up numbers messing up calculations. I ended up paying CPA to prep my taxes
1,I have used the other antivirus software's that you have to pay for and I always got a virus that they did not detect and ending up causing a whole bunch of problems. With avast I have never had a virus or a problem. Easy to use and install!
0,"The biggest annoyance is that when I alt-tab to another application and then alt-tab back to Quicken, I have to click the mouse to get the cursor back in order to enter data.  The Quicken UI generally seems a little flakey and appears to have not been tested very well."
1,"I have worked as a tax preparer, both as a volunteer and a season for H&R Block. Block-At-Home software worked well, interviewing me in detail to uncover all relevant details of my tax situation. Like other DIY tax packages it will carry forward the prior year's return data, then prompt you to confirm.  You don't need to know tax law to use it. But the tax-law help provides enough detail for most situations.<br /><br />Amazon's digital download went fast and easy over wireless. Because it's Amazon Digital I can have some confidence that the software I received is genuine. The software files electronically and then generates a nice pdf copy of the return to save.<br /><br />Recommended."
1,I love it
0,"The changes to the products made this year did not effect me. So, I went ahead and stuck with Turbo Tax since it has always been easy to use and consistent (for me) from year to year. It worked. I got a good return and I am not worried about getting audited. All in all, I got what I expected. I will however have to re-evaluate my options in the future when my tax situation changes. I gave it 3 stars because I think the way they bill for states is exorbitant. I live in one state and work in another so this means I have to file in both states (not all states are this way but mine is). I paid more to add an additional state than I did for the whole tax suite in the first place. For me, it makes this product go from &#34;5 stars, great deal&#34; to &#34;slightly more convenient than hiring a CPA&#34;."
1,"I have used turbo tax since they started. this product beat the manual filing, which I had done before computer."
1,This was a good purchase. There are other competitive programs such as Lighthouse. Nikon has an editing software program. Adobe is the best known and most used.
0,"It was free. so I can't really complain, But tt slows down my computer and never got rid of the virus in my computer."
1,"We have been using this exclusively for years in our business. It's free, reliable, and stable. In addition to supporting the proprietary Microsoft Office formats (which require several hundred dollar software to use otherwise), it supports the Open Document Format so you don't get tied down to any particular office suite.<br /><br />This does everything Microsoft Office does but better and for absolutely free. Unless you need some Microsoft-specific function, this is the program to get."
1,works as expected
0,Too expensive to add multiple states as well as e-filing multiple states.
1,does what its supposed to
1,Excellent antivirus software.
0,I installed it and it told me that I now have 121 days of coverage.  WHAT?!?!  I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />I don't go through that hassle and expense to do it again every 4 months.<br />(Downloading it from amazon is not a big hassle but it was still a waste of my time)<br /><br />As far as Norton 360 in general.. I have been pretty happy with it for years (when i paid $30 something/a full year)
1,"Very convenient with the microsoft sotware. It has everything you need. However, when going back into the software to get the tutorial,  you can't find it. You just have to play around with it."
1,Updating accounts is seamless. I like being able to update all my accounts with one click from the menu. I do however miss the button that allowed you to click and update.  I prefer that than having to choose from a drop down menu.
1,Simplifies payroll to just a few clicks once it is initially set up.
0,"I've been using Quicken since sometime in the 1990's.  Quicken requires mandatory upgrades about every three years (in order to download from one's bank account) With each upgrade, the product gets worse. And I'm getting older (68) and tired of hassling with each upgrade. I wish there were a more reliable product on the market, but there isn't.  Perhaps I'll just start to use Excel.  Quicken could do us all a favor and simply charge for continuing to use an old product. I'd revert to Quicken 2008 - no maybe Quicken 2002.  With the latest upgrade, I can't get my Morgan Stanley account to download.  It did fine in with Quicken 2011.  After deactivating it and reactivating it, I finally got from nothing at all happening to an error message with a phone number to call."
1,works well as what is expected so far.  I hope it getting better in the next tax filing time. Thanks.
0,i spent hours trying to download this new version of Nortons Internet Securities..it kept saying it was expired..? how can Amazon sell expired software downloads?
0,"I've used TT Basic for years and it was fine.  This year I read reviews complaining that Basic it no longer supported schedule D, but since I don't need schedule D I decided to use it.  After going through the whole process, including entering all of my itemized deductions, it tells me it does not support schedule A and I have to upgrade to itemize.  Despite my annoyance at this crass bait and switch, I bit the bullet and went for the upgrade as I had spent an afternoon getting to that point.  To add insult to injury, they charged $5.00 more than their list price for the upgrade.  Since I had been shanghaied into this purchase I thought I'd use the State software, which is included in the &#34;Deluxe&#34; version.  It did not pick up all of my withholdings in it's calculation and thus was going to give me an extra $300 tax liability.  I couldn't find any way to correct the info, so had to abort the State filing.  TurboTax has completely gone to the dogs. Fortunately, I don't use any other Intuit products.  Look elsewhere!"
1,"It's great to see how this product has improved over the years - I'm a loyal customer.  It's as easy to run a $100,000 or $10,000,000 business with the product.  Yea Intuit!"
0,"I'm not even sure what all the upgrades were between 2010 (my old software) and 2013, but in my experience it's a downgrade on performance and an upgrade on visuals and visual effects<br /><br />CONS<br />Smaller buttons which require more precise clicking<br />Occasionally takes too long to load password-protected, or remotely-stored, documents<br />Hangs more than 2010<br />By default, it brings you to this stupid, unnavigable menu whenever you want to open or save... just give us the old menus. Major performance downgrade<br /><br />PROS<br />Scrolling looks cool<br />Cursor is more fluid when it blinks and moves<br />Interesting artistic &#34;themes&#34;<br />SkyDrive"
0,Great so far as a preventative AV but slows down my computer a bit.<br />(Win Vista on Intel 1.7ghz lap top)
1,Did everything I needed it to...been using TurboTax for years. It just works. It lets me do up to 5 returns (Fed and State) which is perfect for my family.
0,"IT DOES NOT WORK.  IT GETS HUNG UP AND DOES NOT ADVANCE AT ANY LEVEL I TRIED.  WHEN I CALLED UP THE SUPPORT STAFF, THEY BECAME IMPATIENT, SEEMED A BIT CONDESCENDING, PASSED ME ONTO VARIOUS 'SUPERVISORS,' THEN, AFTER BEING PUT ON HOLD I EVENTUALLY HEARD A DIAL TONE.  END OF A LONG NON-CONVERSATION.  I HAVE ASKED TO BE CREDITED BACK MY MONEY BUT WAS TOLD THAT IT IS UP TO ROSETTA STONE.<br /><br />I SUGGEST THAT YOU BUY IT THROUGH A STORE AND DOWNLOAD IT YOURSELF.  MY ITALIAN PACKAGE WORKS JUST FINE.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  $150.00 IS A LOT TO THROW AWAY TO A PROFITABLE COMPANY. I WOULD STILL LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREDIT MY MONEY TO OTHER GOOD PRODUCTS THEY SELL.......LIKE MY KINDLE, PERHAPS??"
1,I guess I'm just a loyal customer who usually stays with products or services that meet my needs and do a good job of it. It's only now that I've started searching elsewhere since there is no Windows Phone 8.1 Version for Quicken. Hope Intuit addresses this gap so I can continue my annual ritual of staying current with the latest version as I also do with TuboTax as well.<br /><br />No issues with the latest version and would highly recommend it to others...just wish Intuit also catered to loyal Windows Phone users in addition to IOS and Android for mobile capabilities.
1,Purchased this item from Amazon with Key Code and luckily had great help from McAfee to finish the installation.  You need to remove the old one and install the new one.  I have been happy with McAfee so I will stay with them.  This price is great for this product
1,Was able to use as a first time user.  Turbo Tax Community helped me when I encountered problems. I will use TurboTax again.
0,Upgraded from 2008 and saw few improvements. Prefer the more solid feel of 2008 so reverted to that version.
1,"Turbo Tax is the software I use because having started off using it in the beginning I can now easily import details from a previous tax year to the current one rather than having to type in all of that all over again.  For this reason any incentive to try out a different tax software has, unfortunately, become minimal. The dread of typing in all kinds of details that are importable in Turbo Tax is what's keeping me stuck with the Turbo. The Deluxe version is more appropriate to me than either the Basic or the Premier. To determine which version to select for one's particular needs visit the Turbo Tax home page at [...]"
0,"I bought DeLorme Street Atlas at a local store hoping it would be a viable alternative.  I took it back. It's needlessly complicated and time consuming. S&T was fairly intuitive. I rarely had to consult the Help file. If I didn't use Street Atlas for a month, I needed to be retrained.<br /><br />I'm kicking myself for not buying the latest Microsoft S&T. I have S&T 2009, and can't find a copy of 2011. It wouldn't be up to date, but I bet it is MORE up to date than Street Atlas 2015."
1,Good advice
1,I have been using the Block Home and Business Tax software for over 3 years now and the step by step menu entries allow easy input. The PDF report saving is a godsend. Excellent software!
1,"This is a good program if you have a sole proprietor business, easy to follow ,there has been a problem down loading the selected state. Turbo Tax customer service has been very helpful in solving this problem"
1,"Does what you need it to do and easily. Walks you through all the data entry and e-files with state and federal. If you have something else you need to do, like quarterly estimated taxes, it has the forms for those as well."
1,"2014 new download of product, great price and great product. Don't be afraid to buy this,its set and forget it."
1,"I have been using TurboTax for 15 years.  It's a great product, as long as you READ THE INFORMATION it provides to you.  If you're not sure about something, click the link in the program to view more information about that particular subject.  It explains things in plain English and gives you simple rules to find out if you qualify for certain deductions.<br /><br />Don't leave negative reviews for this product because it doesn't include State tax filing.  Amazon clearly states that it doesn't include state.  If you want state, there is another version on Amazon for an extra 10 dollars that includes state.<br /><br />TurboTax is a great product.  No complaints in 15 years."
0,I teach yearbook and I purchased Publisher 2013 to work on my school's yearbook while at home. Little did I know that it is so slow and laggy with pictures that it is completely unusable. At my school we have publisher 2007 which works perfectly fine with the exact same files and my computer is significantly better than the bargain basement machines that we use at school. Now I still have to work on the yearbook at school and I'm out nearly $100. Thanks for nothing Microsoft.
0,"Still trying to get it to install on my Windows 8.1 machine. Seems to be plenty of others out there having the same problem, but very little help coming from Intuit."
1,Download went quickly and efficiently on 2 computers I use. I get automatic updates regularly. RJO
1,I lost some of my on-line stuff in the update.  Still haven't been able to find how to replace it.  Download was great!
0,"I can put my dogs head on my body, and my head on my dogs body. I love my dog and Adobe Photoshop."
1,I was so glad to be able to find Quickbooks at such a reasonable price.  I use is everyday for work and would not use anything else.
1,"My computer works way better now, it immediately cleaned up viruses on my computer.  I did have to turn off the firewall but it cleans up the computer well."
1,Installed easily - imported info from Quicken 2009 properly - got direct from Intuit
1,just started using this program and think it will be a wonderful tool!
1,I´ve been using McAfee for several yeasr without any problem. I recommend it as a good value for the price I paid.
0,This software is clunky but functional.  Screens display information on each screen.  The last few questions are often not visible and require scrolling down to view which is confusing.  A well designed program would display all on a single screen.  Apparently this software was created by developers using HD resolution displays.  On my 1440 x 900 notebook it is annoying.
1,"Great product...I paid about $200 to do my taxes at my local H&R Block office last year, and found myself looking for cheaper alternatives this tax season. I bought this product because my partner needed tax software that came with support and help for investments and stocks. Turbo Tax was not only more expensive, it didn't have this key feature she really needed. For a fraction of the price of what I paid last year, I got peace of mind this year. It took me about an hour to get through the software, but it was easy to use throughout and I never really felt lost.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to using H&R Block at home in the the future. This was my first experience doing my own taxes at home, and it really couldn't have been easier. Highly recommend. No issues at all on my 2007 MacBook Pro."
0,This is the worst security software product I have ever tried. A lot of issues with installing.  I know now what not to purchase in the future.
1,"Protection for all my devices.  Windows 8.1 and Android, good value."
1,"IT MAKES THE JOB OF FILING A TAX RETURN EASY.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, THERE IS A GREAT SUPPORT STAFF."
0,I have used this software for many years.  This year I discovered a problem.  Contacted support chat line - spent a couple of hours getting bounced around between different people.  Finally - they admitted there was a glitch in the program (it was about a refund on tuition and how to report it) - wanted me to send them my return - after deleting personal info. I chose not to - did not like the process.  Went online - saw other complaints about the same issue.  Ended up purchasing Turbo Tax.  Had to reenter everything - but finally done now - and am very happy with it - will be using Turbo Tax in the future!
1,I love the fact that I can print my own quality business cards with this stock!
1,"I can customize this antivirus program to not give me false positives. It is well maintained, it updates the virus database regularly: I have not seen anything quirky about it.<br /><br />Formerly I used Kaspersky and Microsoft essentials.<br />Works just as well on Android phones.<br />Great work guys."
1,Does what it promises.
0,"Very disappointed so far. Importing my W-2 didn't work (i.e., causes the program to crash). Seemed to have less guidance when it comes to rental property expenses. The difference in the return amount (when compared to TT online) is enough for me to purchase TurboTax as well. If I had to do it again, I would have just purchased TurboTax."
1,"Aside from a small learning curve this product is outstanding. It is feature rich and functional, although I don't use all the options it can monitor most of your financial information. Since this is from the same company that makes Turbo Tax and most professional tax software it integrates well with your tax needs."
0,"Hi, did anyone else run in to the problem that it is charging for filing state taxes? when it clearly states it includes one download for state?"
0,Works well
1,I have been using Avast since 2004 and it has fulfilled my expectations in every regard. I would recommend this software to anybody.
1,"TurboTax must be the bane of the CPA world.  Seriously - we have really confusing taxes and this always talks us down off the ledge, holds us tenderly by the hand, and gets us through tax season.  Love TurboTax!"
1,"I got this so I could make animations. It is pretty good except that I wish that when I make a person with a few rectanges, an oval, etc. the bone wouldnt bend the shape."
1,Its truly good software for anyone wanting to animate with ease! Comes with many features to speed up an otherwise tedious process!
0,"This is a very sophisticated program with many flaws. The learning curve is quite steep. To convert a pdf of a book with just text works fairly well and produces a useable Kindle book, But if there are images, boxed texts, etc. the Kindle text is completely distorted. Items like the table of contents are so distorted that they are unusable."
0,"I have had the Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software for years and it works fantastic on Windows XP and Windows 7 with ISO files.  Then I bought a brand new Sony Flip 15A Ultrabook which has Windows 8.1 on it, but the Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software doesn't work properly - yet it is the best (fastest and most powerful) computer I now own.  The PowerDVD 9 software installed with no issues on Win 8.1 and it played my home movie DVDs with no issue, BUT it won't play the home movie Blu-Rays.  Cyberlink software tells me my drivers are outdated, but they aren't, they are all current and updated.  I installed the Cyberlink BD Advisor as it recommended and I passed all tests perfectly.  The issue isn't with my new Ultrabook or Blu-ray playback, it is with the interaction of PowerDVD 9 and Windows 8.1.  So I read on a couple forums it was Cyberlink's way to get you to buy the new software because earlier versions don't work with Win 8.1....nice.....or not!!  And of course, they won't give us a patch to make it work.<br /><br />So out of curiosity, I downloaded the Cyberlink PowerDVD 13 Ultra 30 day trial off the Cyberlink website to see if all the reports are right....sure enough, it played the Blu-ray home movies on Win 8.1, but honestly, not as well as PowerDVD 9 does.  When the Blu-Ray ISO first loads on Win 8.1 with PowerDVD 13 Ultra, there is no sound.  The only way to get the sound to work is to switch from \\""Classic Mode\\"" (which is best for laptops) to \\""Cinema Mode\\"" (which is designed for a remote, which I don't have with a laptop).  Then the audio will play once you switch modes.  So to make the software work as it should with a laptop, you have to then switch back again to \\""Classic Mode\\""....so it is about a three or four minute process just to get audio to work right.  Then all is good, if you call it that.  Again, PowerDVD 9 NEVER did this.<br /><br />And as far as buying the PowerDVD 13 Ultra on Amazon's website:  Right now it is charging $70.61 for a digital download.  Last week, swear to you, the digital download was $44 from the same Amazon Digital Download vendor.  So you are telling me, for a digital download, which has no physical copies to run out of stock on, suddenly goes up that much in a single week?  What's going on with that?<br /><br />I am frustrated because Cyberlink's PowerDVD 13 Ultra isn't as good as my Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software, yet they are sort of forcing you to purchase the new software if you want the Blu-ray ISO files to work.  Which is ironic, because I read on another customer review on this Amazon site where Cyberlink actually responded to the post, that Cyberlink doesn't force you to buy the newest version to make the older software work, and that they support all of their versions - yet this isn't true.  Unless they could please respond to this and help me get my PowerDVD 9 to work on Win 8.1.<br /><br />I'm just afraid it'll be just a short amount of time until Cyberlink doesn't support this 13 version either and makes you then buy their newest one instead.  Ugh!t week, swear to you, the digital download was $44 from the same Amazon Digital Download vendor.

0,The program just simply SUCKS......I am a long time MAC user and have loved the way this simply software worked in the past.....thought that after this many years of snubbing all us faithful users.....we finally had a great new version to work with.......WRONG.......It is the time for me to generate end of year reports.....I am doing my best to use the customer report feature.....using tags and categories  I want this to separate all my data.......I get NO good separation on all my splits......they all show up at the end of the report......and NOT in each tags area of the report..... WHAT the hell......it is a computer program.....it is suppose to be awesome at lists and separation of data......Anyone out there who can help......Otherwise I have to compile my reports by hand...WONDERFUL.........
1,"I've been using avast for over 5 years and I have never had any problems with viruses. It was recommended to me by a friend and I've been recommending it to my friends. Compared to my friends who have used Norton or McAfee, they have caught viruses using those products and I've been virus free on all my computers for 5+ years."
0,I have used this program.  There really are no good Resume programs as using a resume is a dated way to find a job.  There Job Finder part of the program is a joke.  Expect it to pull up openings over a year old.
1,I've used TurboTax for 3 years in a row and love it.  Being able to submit electronically and the Amazon gift card bonus was a pleasant surprise.  I plan to use it next year as well.
1,"I had been using Microsoft Money but it wouldn't work with Windows 10, so I got Quicken 2015 and started using it and it is so much easier and better than Microsoft Money."
0,"Download ran for over four hours, said complete.  Install went for about 20 min then got message about some exe file missing please download again.  I do not want to use MB to do, I ordered CD version.  Dont think I will download any software I can buy in store again."
1,Good Product and Good services!!
1,I ordered this because I had a trial program on my new computer.  Since I had no issues with the trial I decided to keep the same program.  I also liked that I could put it on multiple computers so my daughter's will have protection too.
0,the product works as advertised seems to be working just fine I can't we tell. Its a virus checker I have it on my tablet smart phone and computer. I do think that the price even on sale is high which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.
1,Handles most things well.<br />Doesn't handle foreign pensions<br />other than that is is easy to use<br />I have used it for years
0,"i have for the past 10 year use TT deluxe version,  went online to buy the deluxe but have to upgrade ... not a very happy customer"
1,Item as expected. Performs as expected.
1,"This year I decided to just get the basic federal edition, instead of one with a state, and just do the state myself on the state page (which has it's own online system, and ultimately took less time than the federal one). But if you need a state be sure to buy one that includes the state software, as it is much more expensive to purchase it separately.<br />So, for my purposes it worked great and I didn't have any problems with installing it, or entering my information and filing."
1,Works Great.  Avast has kept me free of issues from viruses with minimal performance overhead.  Excellent product.
1,Avast rivals that of high end paid for security software. The Pop up notifications are easily disabled or minimized. .
1,"This is great software, that I was using for long time. You can place all your financial info in one place, review your transactions and remain up to date with your money and expenses. It save me a plenty of time while surfing different bank web sites ( especially if you have many cards and accounts), by visiting one place. There are other free tools that you can use instead but this one worth every penny you pay for. Highly recommended."
0,"Although I was able to install Kaspersky, it failed to update data and files repeatedly. I have Windows 8.1 Pro."
1,"Honestly this is an essential piece of software. It works and runs great. It IS updated for Retina. If you do any form of business or actual work on your macbook this is a must.<br /><br />The layout takes a little getting used to compared to the MS version but if your comfortable with the suite, you will pick it up quickly."
1,This has cleaned?protected my computer better than any other anti-malware that I have tried! Highly recommend!
1,"Birthday present for my grandaughter.  Great price, easy download and install, and just what she needed for college.  It is just what she needed and the immediate delivery was a real plus."
0,"Won't download my investments that 2010 version had no problem with.  Called for tech service.  Won't talk to you without a credit card number.  At $60/hour, they have lost me as a customer that has used Quicken since 2001.  Anyone out there want to start up a competitor?"
1,Works &#34;Perfect&#34;.  Great Program!
0,Software works great. The refund promised for those that used the software last year does not. I met the criteria as being forced to upgrade but Turbo Tax says they do not have a record and I woud not qualify for the promised refund. I bought online the last two years via download and the software remains on my Mac.
0,"I'm not angry enough to write a one star review cause it did my taxes properly in under 30 minutes by copying all kinds of information from my last tax return without me having to dig through tons of drawers.<br /><br />But, why the bait and switch? Why tell me the product comes with federal and state efile, then CHARGE me $40 more to use the feature? I mean, I would have paid $80 to know my very simple taxes could be done in minutes. I kinda felt ripped off. Even tho I would have paid that money for the convenience. I mean, at the very least, the title of this is very misleading. It should just say Tax Software ONLY. Additional fees will apply to efile."
0,"I've used Tax Cut in the past with no problem, but this year it's a disaster.  You can update, but it doesn't actually work, and without the update you can't file electronically or get to the state forms.  You also can't get to a human being, and the assistance - which is just a computer response - says to disable your firewall.  Seriously?  This is the last time I'm buying this product."
0,"I downloaded the software from Amazon thinking all I had to was install the software and go.  WRONG! The software does not take you to the registration page, instead it tries to open a web page but gets an error when opening.  You need to go to to the iTV site, and register the software with your order number (from Amazon or other seller).  Then need to wait about 24 - 48 hours for purchase confirmation.<br /><br />You can also buy and download the software directly from iTV at their web page for $10 less than you pay at Amazon.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars because of the lack of information given when you purchase the software.  I am also very disappointed with Amazon for selling this item at an inflated price."
1,"If you want to create burn dvd movies on Mountain Lion and use H.264 1080p video you need this software.  You can even burn HD content on a dvd disk.  Instead of downloading from Amazon, buy it download the demo from Adobe.  Then install the license keys.  You will not have the problems discussed by other reviews."
1,"I am designer running a small business on a tight budget creating educational materials for children 18 and under. This was an excellent buy for me and here's why; the fonts are extremely legible and fun/inviting (not wild and useless). I have spent too much time trying to find quality fonts for a good price and for commercial use. I don't have $200+ to spend on one font. The \\""cheap\\"" companies that sell fonts online usually sell unreadable garbage. If you are designing materials that are to be more sophisticated, you probably won't find what you need in this set. Stick with Adobe or something else.    If you find only one font to use, it has paid for itself. And yes, it does count every form (bold, italic etc.) of a font as an individual type which is fair in my opinion as every form of a font creates a different look though related. So you are getting 1000+ fonts with many different forms or you are getting 4000 fonts. No matter how you look at it, you are getting a good deal."
1,"I adore Word Perfect, been using it since the Monmons came out with the first version.<br /><br />This is faster, cleaner, lots more settings, and the high point as always is its &#34;Reveal Code&#34; button so when one wishes you can see exactly what is controlling your text format.<br /><br />Claudia Strasbaugh"
1,I love these! I can't study without them anymore; they're great at keeping you focused in an easy to use flash card format.  I wish I knew about these earlier!
0,"Unlike previous year's &#34;Deluxe&#34; versions, this year's &#34;Deluxe&#34; does not include Schedule D (results of sales of stocks, etc.) support. Schedule D support requires a $30 &#34;upgrade&#34;."
1,Found the program I needed here on Amazon. Download was fast and program works as expected from Microsoft.  Good buy.
1,Great backup for recording onn the road with my Surface Pro 3.
1,The TurboTax deluxe met my expectations fully.  The download and installation went smoothly.  The con was the price which was inflated $10 above what I could get at Sam's wholesale Warehouse.
1,good deal for what I paid

For three hours on Sunday, I got zero support from Norton and was actually hacked by companies with Norton in their name.<br />Very dissatisfied with buying Norton 360 online from Amazon. Very , very dissatisfied that my computer was hacked. THERE SHOULD BE AN AUTOMATIC WAY TO GIVE YOU AN ACTIVATION CODE FOR AN ONLINE PURCHASE WITHOUT DEALING WITH THUGS.

0,"The Amazon purchase, download, and install process using my daughter's university verification worked with no problems. Installation start-finish was within 20 minutes.<br /><br />However, I HATE the money-gouging subscription model for office software, which MicroSoft continues to &#34;update&#34; and release, screwing up the increasingly bloated interface, without meaningful improvements, forcing users to re-buy, to remain compatible with everyone else.<br /><br />Quark XPress did this, until everybody in the Graphics industry flocked to Adobe Indesign.<br /><br />I cannot wait until the next generation bails on MicroSoft Office for Google Docs."
1,I have been using this software for many years and find it very helpful. Even expatriate reporting which is potentially complicated has been made simple and accurate. Only once(in over 10 yrs) has the IRS  raised a question which was successfully resolved in a phone call. There are marked imporovements over the years.

I say \\""attempts to do something\\"" because after three attempts at converting a 15 minute video where I left the computer alone for over 3 hours, nothing happened and the program locked up. I had to close it from Task Manager. I would not recommend this program."

1,"I've used Tax Cut for the past 6 years.  Never had a problem and I like it better than TurboTax.  Anyway, I waited until the last minute to do my taxes...again and I had to load Tax Cut (H & R Block at home). I had 2 copies that they mailed to me, no discounts and with my state would have cost me well over $50.  Found this download version on Amazon.  I read the good and the bad reviews and decided to take a stab at it.  In less tan 10 minutes I was importing last years information and adding this years.  Great way to do it for me, and the price was really cheap.  Bad thing was, my State (the wonderful state of Georgia), still wanted to charge me an additional $15 to e-file, so I spent the cost of a stamp instead.  That's not H & R Block's proble.  All in all, really easy to do and I did notice some people couldn't find their activation code but it was right on the download page on Amazon.  Since I read alot of the reviews I wrote it down as soon as I saw it to avoid confusion."
0,"I was absolutely satisfied with the version I was using but forced to up grade to this crap. I hate this new version, cannot get it to work without tech support, (the whole support thing lasted over 29 hours to import my saved accounts from the version I had).  Too many useless options, cannot transfer saved or backed up data from previous version to this one without jumping through hoops and offering up your firstborn and I'm still trying to get banking information on automatic downloads which worked perfectly in the previous version.  So bad that I have now resorted to managing my accounts by hand now. A total waste."

0,Do not use this if you wish to sync your iPod to iTunes.  I wasted 2 days working on this issue including re-installing windows 7.  The only resolution was to uninstall Norton otherwise my iPods would only be seen by windows but never long enough by iTunes to sync.
1,I like this pretty well but i still prefer an actual disk.  I am able to keep up with a disk better.  Just my personal preference.
0,"Intuit has a reputation for shipping sloppy, poorly-designed code, but they've outdone themselves with this product.  I have been trying to use this product for two months and I STILL can't even figure out how to print Invoices out (I have to use my ancient QuickBooks product), and how that I have customers entered, I still can't see my invoices (a customer lost his, and I can't print him a new one.<br /><br />I with some enterprising computer geek with a modicum of accounting experience could start over with a new product, and help out Intuit where they belong:  With Osborne, Palm, and Microsoft BoB:  A sad, distant memory.<br /><br />I hate this company's products with a passion, and I waste entirely too many hours running my small business just cleaning up after their crashes (I'm at Release 5), and trying to figure out how to do simple things.  Help, too, is pathetic."
0,"I'm amazed that a so-called training course this poor even exists. The course consists of a little over 50 short videos, but there is no structure, logic or organization to the way they are presented. You download an application titled Learning Poser 14. You launch it, click the button to start the videos, and you'll see a collection of files with cryptic names -- names that give little indication of what each video is about. What's worse, the order in which the information is presented appears nearly random. The first video you'll encounter, at the top of your screen, is named, \\""01-G2-tee-ontoRoxie.\\"" Launch it, and you'll that see that this video is actually titled, \\""Fitting Room - Long Sleeve T-Shirt 1.\\"" Why that should be the first video in a course on learning Poser is a mystery. But it gets weirder. Play the video, and the first words you hear are, \\""OK, so lets practice our new skills in the fitting room...\\"" Our new skills? That would suggest this was not intended to be the first video in this course. But you're on your own trying figure out where the course might actually start. There are at least four files whose names begin with \\""01\\"" and another five whose names begin with \\""1.\\"" I suspect there is some useful information to be found among these files, somewhere, but good luck finding it. It's like trying to read Moby Dick, if it didn't start with \\""Call me Ishmael\\"" but the chapters were shuffled like a deck of cards and presented in random order. A complete mess, and a total waste of ten bucks."
1,Anti-Virus software (and more) that works perfectly and... it's FREE!!  It is totally non-invasive and doesn't slow your computer (unlike Norton).  I especially like the protection from websites that could cause harm.  I am totally impressed and have been for years now.
0,"I just downloaded this software, which I generally don't like to do. Immediately after downloading it, I proceeded to convert a power point presentation to a DVD. After it was supposed to be finished I proceeded to play it in my blue ray player, it wouldn't play, so I went to another room and attempted to play it in a regular dvd player and it still would not play. In conclusion I have determined that the downloaded software doesn't work."
0,Your TurboTax Deluxe 2014 needs to be GREATLY simplified for the general public.  Will probably not use it next year!!!
1,"I was using CS3 so this was a big advance for me. There are many options that I haven't used yet, but most things are still in the same place and easily found from past versions. i am still discovering new things each time I use it, but that kinda makes it like a treasure hunt. Only frustrating when I need to do something fast and I can't find it. I am happy with my purchase."
1,As usual I was quite pleased with Turbo Tax deluxe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that a couple questions in the income section were not as clear as they had been in previous years. But overall a great product
1,"Great software and with a nearly level learning curve. After watching a few of the online videos I was able to jump right into the program. Within about two hours, I was layouting some moderately complex traditional animations. I've been dabbling with the rotoscoping features and its surprisingly straight forward. The documentation is decent, but the videos are definitely better. They helped with the rigging in particular.<br /><br />So far I've been very impressed, especially for the price. I could do more with this program after two hours than I could with Flash after three days. The download took a while, but once downloaded it loaded right up without a hitch. I've got an imac with 12 gigs of RAM and a quadcore I5 and it runs fine. I'd definitely recommend it, especially for someone who is new to animation on a computer."

0,"This version of Office is a complete rip-off.  You can't just buy the software now; you have to buy a yearly subscription.  If you go on-line to buy Office 2010; Microsoft won't let you download it.  You have to download 2013.  I'm going to see if I can find office 2010 on disk.  If I can't, then I'll use Open Office, which Oracle provides for free."
1,"It's nice to be able to edit and make my own PDFs at home. I've had Acrobat Pro at work for several years. It's so useful there, I decided to bite the bullet and have it at home. Great product."
1,"Using it now, up to standards of other Quick Books.  Been using them for several years."
1,very informative and easy to use
1,Great.
1,Has some good well written resume templates to help you out on your job search. I do however think they should include dropbox support.
1,"This is an excellent, free program. I don't particularly understand how computers work, but I know that this is one of the best programs available. It's also free, so... how can you lose?"
1,You get what you pay for. The exercises were a great prep for a college Japanese I class.

1,Great place to store your photos. Easy to use and  very fast response time for up and down loading.
1,"I have been using Avast since a computer guy told me about it years ago. No question it does the job and for free you certainly can't beat the price.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Apparently senior management recently (last 6 months or so) decided to up the pressure on the consumer with LOTS more pop-up notes saying &#34;this is wrong with your computer,&#34; or &#34;that software needs to be fixed...&#34;<br /><br />Look, I understand companies need money to exist and don't blame them for trying to get the customer to upgrade. But, these constant pop-ups are sometimes annoying, especially when the &#34;danger&#34; they are warning about is really not a problem. I don't like it and betting other Avast users don't either. I will continue using Free Avast until I've had it with the ads. Then I'll need to make a decision to either upgrade or try another free antivirus."
1,I love Norton Security!  Have only downloaded on 1 computer because I don't know how to do it from the internet so I have to get my daughter to do it.
0,"This program allows me to use a Word document on my computer as a tool for writing recipes, letters, ideas, graphs etc. For the price you get more applications than I use. Overall it is a good program."
1,"Love PM Matic,  it is so easy to install. It has how-to-videos to help you every step of the way. PC Matic let's you set up a schedule for your automatic scans and then the scan report goes to your inbox. It really gives you peace of mind to know the scan will automatically be done and that the report is available for you to view at your leisure. Having PC Matic, means you have one less thing to worry about. It really couldn't be easier."
1,"We purchased this from Best Buy during Christmas for my college daughters new PC. She let her BF download it and he threw away the Product code for 3 PC's!!! She still needed it---so, I don't shop for stuff like that anywhere else by Amazon first!!! Great purchase and gave the code to her over the phone and she was good to go!! All these years, I haven't ever had a bad buy or shipment from Amazon but then I read and READ before I agree to buy from that vendor and if Amazon is shipping themselves for a few more bucks--then I would rather have it shipped from them. I get it faster! You can't order from Hong Kong and expect to get it in 2 days. Keep up the awesome growth, service and innovative thinking!"
1,"An excellent first line of defense, no bloat like other &#34;commercial&#34; big brand name AV apps.  I've also used their &#34;paid&#34; Internet Security package and it to is excellent."
1,I've used most of the other products but none protects likes Avast and runs silently in the background! Great job Avast team!
1,I just renewed my contract.  Very pleased with PCMatic.  I have had PCMatic for 4 years.
1,Download was quick and painless.  Program booted up nicely and was able to use in about 5 minutes from purchase.
1,"Great Product, easy to use."
0,"Well, I've used Quicken for many years and this Deluxe 2014 version is the worst by far.  I was using the 2011 version and it worked pretty well, but when I was forced to migrate to the 2014 version what a decline in performance I'm experiencing.<br /><br />For some unknown reason Quicken has designed this 2014 version to have to communicate on-line with the Intuit's Cloud on each transaction and therefore the performance is very, very, very slow.  After each entry or transaction you wait for the entire page to be refreshed, with other delays of course, and finally you can execute your next step.  VERY slow and completely unnecessary as I don't use any functions provided by the Quicken Cloud anyway.<br /><br />The only not-unfavorable thing I can say about it is that it's pretty cheap...and that's it!"
1,I love the 2010 office format. It. Is easy to use and the improvements in the tool bar make it faster and simple to find what you need. I would recommend this product to everyone.
1,Avast has saved my computer more than once.  There are two levels of scanning. I would recommend the free version to anyone.
0,"Same as the online website.  Even with the Amazon Prime Deal I didn't find where it provided me with anything different than through the website.  I was hoping that it was bundled with E-File state to make it worth it, but came out paying the same price as online (at the time of review).  Easy to use just like their website though."
1,"I've used Tax Cut for 3 Tax seasons now & It is truly easier to use and a cut above the other Tax programs. I purchased the premium version & I imported last year's return in about 2 clicks. I plan on e-filing again & this copy allows users to file up to 5 e-file returns. I own my own business and the schedule C interview makes depreciation schedules and legit deductions a breeze. Also, there is a built in audit/review feature that will help you \\""tweek\\"" your tax return and Q.C. before sending it to the IRS. I downloaded this 2009 version on the web using road-runner a 5 minute download which results in FREE SHIPPING.  A Highly recommended purchase - used to pay my CPA over $[...] bucks for this same service. Hope this review helps & builds confidence if you're considering this product !  [...]"
1,As Advertised
1,"I used WP for years, and then got reluctantly sucked into the ubiquitous Word culture.  Which I could cope with - unhappily - till the new Word came out, and I had to deal with translating docX's.  When my husband got the new Office I installed it, took one look at that ribbon and said I AM NOT LEARNING THIS.  And when upon exploration I discovered that WP Home and Student could be purchased for a very modest sum and would read docx's, i said why not?  (I had thought I needed the pro version, but I don't, actually. I use the program almost exclusively for word processing.)<br /><br />The program is much as I remember it (unlike Office, it doesn't change for the sake of change).  Reveal codes is still there so I can figure out why the document is doing what it's doing.  The menus are easy to understand and rearrange to suit me. It does everything I want it to do, and every time I see the WP splash screen as it loads, I smile.<br /><br />My only gripe is that in a Word-centered world, they could make it easier to automatically save your documents as Word files.  When you set it to do that, it saves a new doc as a word file, but when you open that file, edit it and change it, you get a window asking what form you want to save it in and the default is WP.  If I could I would, but I can't, and I wish they'd recognize that and let me set the program so the default on every save is Word.  (I even have to save my personal docs as word if I want to edit them on my tablet, as WP hasn't got an Android app - only a reader).<br /><br />Sorry, WP - you would probably sell more copies, not fewer, if you made it easier for users to exist seamlessly in a world where 98% of people use Word.  Fools that they are."
0,"Was surprised and very unhappy that ClickChart's install routine did not extend to me the option of establishing an installation directory other than that specified as default.  I will not tolerate this behavior, and will not use a program that behaves this way, even if its publisher releases it as freeware or open-source software."
1,"Switched 2 years ago from Turbo Tax because it was a lot cheaper.  Surprised that I like it much better.  With Turbo I had to do my taxes, print them out, then go back in to tinker withe some of the entries to get everything in.  Block seems easier to use and gets everything right the first time.  I highly recommend it but suggest you buy it fairly late as the price goes down as you approach tax time.  Wait at least until the end of January to get a deal."
1,Wish Quicken could be half as decent as Microsoft.  Everything went smooth.  I like that they keep record of download in case you need to download it again.
0,"Got taken on a &#34;sale&#34; for this terrible software, inflexible, poor import options, amateurish interface. I could go on. Terrible, avoid at all costs."
1,It is a great program that is very easy to use.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for an easy editing tool!
0,"Registration is a disaster, you will be sent to an offshore call center and then waste hours of your time while they claim the registration code was emailed to your student email address.  Not worth the time or effort, poorly marketed"
0,"after downloading it , it came up as a 10 day trial program. Had to go direct to Norton and buy a real program.<br />deceiving ad. wasted my money!!!! I t should be fully refunded!!"
1,No complaints. It works well on mulitple PCs. Norton is safe and reliable. It is worth the minimal cost. AVG is not as complete.
0,"I have used turbotax for over a decade. After paying for the deluxe version, including paying upfront for the state, I ended up having to pay more than $60.00 in hidden charges. Without even getting a refund. I don't mind paying to have my taxes done but I'd like to know the charges upfront. I will need to find another way to do my taxes next year."
1,We found it a sensible way to complete our taxes instead of going to a tax attorney.
1,Can do tax was efficent got it done happy received already in time for tax day good tax program.  Thanks.
0,"To get a normal competent tax program from TurboTax, you have to get the highest priced Home and Business version.  The other versions cannot do normal forms such as Schedule C for business or Schedule D for stocks.  I don't like being forced into an upsell.<br /><br />If Intuit's software developers are as dumb as their marketing execs, there are probably a lot of errors in the programs as well."
1,Great software...made my somewhat complex tax situation a breeze for sure.  I'd buy it and use it year after year.
1,"When I was having problems with a virus on my computer, my son who is an IT professional recommended that I download AVAST and use it instead of the antivirus program that I had been using.  I downloaded AVAST and did a boot scan.  AVAST found several problems that it quarantined.  Since then, I have had no problems."
0,"1 star down because, this is a bit weaker than my expectation.  TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  These days, you can download software for free and try it out before buying it during the demo period.  I'm not sure if this was a smart choice; but on a Lightning Sale, it was worth it to me.  If you want something more powerful, there are other options.  If you are serious about Video Editing, you'll want something that incorporates better sound editing, and other things related to production, such as Sony's, etc, offering here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'm taking 1 more star down because Amazon's download system was extremely poor and slow.  I consider this to be part of the product, because installation and download took almost half a day.  Because the download took so long, I couldn't install my new harddrive or my USB 3.0 pci-e card I bought, because I was afraid I might have to start over the download.  It used up all my time!!  Very slow downloading, Amazon!  Snails pace and torture. I have extremely fast internet, and that was a terrible experience.  Any company that sells software on Amazon should have the customer download it from their own site -- not from Amazon's servers.  Amazon should just provide the link & the activation code.  Corel -- please figure out why it was so slow and give us a work around.  I would have just downloaded it elsewhere, except I was afraid that only the Amazon download would work for activation.  Amazon needs to be clearer about this and give us a choice of downloading from faster servers.<br /><br />Until Amazon improves its download speeds, I'm buying boxed software only."
0,"Coming from an experience developer and graphic artist I was astonished to hear from a Corel technician who inspected my new, high-powered computer and my computer's processes that I should quote: &#34;go a little slower&#34; if I don't want Paint Shop Pro X6 to crash&#34;.  Wow.  If adding a few images can make this software crash I don't want to hear from a Corel tech (after paying $25) that I need to go a little slower.<br />I have never provided a review on Amazon and generally don't like reviews, but I felt compelled to report this for future potential purchasers of this product.  Otherwise, I like the improvements from old Paint Shop, but I can't have software crashing in this day and age.  Careful......"
0,"The computer I bought had it on it already, but when I upgraded to a newer version, it didn't even recognize that I already had it on my computer and was just trying to upgrade to the newer version. Strange.  Plus their customer support is LOUSY.  If you have problems with the software, you end up talking to people in India who don't seem to understand English well enough and don't resolve your problem AT ALL, which is very frustrating."
0,"I recently purchased this download to obtain a new Product Key to renew my existing Norton 360 installations which were about to expire. After clicking the 'Renew' tab and 'Enter Product Key', Norton 360 advises you that any remaining days on your subscription will be added to the new renewal. DON'T BELIEVE IT!!<br /><br />This a scam that Norton has been pulling for years. If you purchase a new Product Key here for $34 (instead of paying THEM $79), Norton 360 treats it as a new install ... meaning that they DO NOT automatically add any remaining days to your renewal. It took me 30+ minutes in an online chat for Norton to manually add those days back to my account.<br /><br />Good product, but be sure to watch Norton like a hawk!!!"
0,"After five years of using TurboTAx....I give up. The software has changed. It's very confusing. They've changed the way it works. I can't explain exactly what they did, but comparing it to the past years I've used it it does not calculate or pull the same reports as it did before. After spending $70 bucks and 5 hours time I scrapped it and called a CPA to do my taxes. Totally frustrated. They lost a customer."
1,Software is a good value since it covers 3 computers for a year. It is easy to install and requires very little set-up.
1,So far so good. Installation was simple. And run quietly.
1,It's great to have such a super product free of charge.  Thank you!!!
0,"As an IT person and consultant on ERP software, I have a pretty clear image of what a small financial management software should do. This one is doing much more however it does require from you to devote much time to do things right. It does support banks where no other software supports, but in some cases you'll need to communicate extensively with Quicken in order to find out what is wrong and you are not able to download transactions (usually an issue with the Bank and not with the software itself). For my home needs I have returned to my previous software that does less things faster."
1,Great way to keep your finances in check. It is also a breeze to balance your checkbook. I do like the fact that you can make a summary of your tax information at the end of the year and present it to your CPA. This only requires just a little time in setting up your payee/category information.
1,"Here are the reasons AVG is a superior antivirus to the competition.<br /><br />1) It dynamically adjusts its own resource usage depending on how you are using your computer. Too many of the competitors slow down your computer so much that the cure is worse than the disease. This is not the case with AVG as it just gets out of the way.<br /><br />2) Plenty of features that prevent you from getting infected in the first place and make browsing the web safer from drive by malware. Some of the competitors have this but again, they are too intrusive where AVG is not.<br /><br />3) Easy to use interface in the new version keeps things simple<br /><br />While AVG is in my opinion the best antivirus out there (pay version or free), there are some things you should know. You should buy it at the same time you buy a new computer. Install it first before you get infected.<br /><br />While AVG is good, it is also popular enough to be targeted by rootkits that can try to prevent it from being installed on a compromised computer. If you already have an infection, look up a good free &#34;Second opinion scanner&#34;, clean the infection, and then install AVG.<br /><br />Additionally note that when you buy this, the software is available in Amazon's vault. However, you don't have to download it from there. If you experience problems that Amazon cannot resolve, you can download the trial from AVG directly and just enter your key.<br /><br />About the key: It is a 30 day key which allows you time to register and get the full 2-year key. Done and done. Now I'm activated for 2 years."
1,"Works as well as past editions. As everyone is aware of now there are some schedules, i.e. C and D that are no longer included in this version. However, for more simple filings it fills the requirement. This version included 1 state tax filing and once you have completed the federal filing it seamlessly fills out the state return. My only negative comment is; some questions are asked in a manner in which I don't find the answer is obvious."
0,"It is too basic and not what I was seeking. Since I downloaded it I couldn't return it or I would have. However, it is exactly what it says it is...just a checkbook that you enter on your computer and no more."
1,"This is the best thing for myself and my business I can't be leave the time I save.<br />I run a small printing and office supply company, I do all the book work,management,sales,production and I have one part time employee. This gets me home in time for supper...thanks Quick Books"
1,"TurboTax is a great product I've been using the last 4 years. For a numbers-phobic person, they make it very easy and keeps me tracking with what I need to do to take care of my tax return. Thank you!"
1,I my opinion this is the best photo editing program around. There are so many tweaks and fine tuning available! Some of these are still to be discovered. Worth every penny ($) that I paid for it.
0,Just purchased a couple of hours ago and haven't not been able to download the software.  I keep getting an error.  I window shows up for me to email for support... I have not heard back yet.  Will update if I make any progress.
0,The download software will not load past data from online Block software. You are not able to use the key code for online software either. So do not buy if you are trying to save some money on the online version.
1,"I have been using TurboTax for a while now.  It always does a good job and is reasonably priced, though not always particularly cheap.  Four stars for the pricing issue on filing and program cost, but worth it if you want a guided tour.  If you have a simple return, you could try the free 'simple file' type of programs, but I prefer to try to get back every penny stolen from me, so I work the program hard and find every penny I can.  For that, this is a good program."
1,"I trade using Scottrade and used to have H+R Block do it for $330. Got sick of paying $330 for a little old lady to do my taxes and decided to give TurboTax a try. WOW... I did my taxes faster with TurboTax, including stocks, than my visit to Holy Ripoff would take and it was $90 total. Not a bad way to save $240. Now...if we could only get the politicians to pass a Fair or Flat Tax and eliminate all deductions and lower tax rates an equivalent amount..."
1,I love avast!  Avast is one of the best antivirus programs ever.  I have used it for several years and have not had any problems with it.
1,"I don't go a lot of places on the internet that I don't recognize as my first line of defense.  However, my address book has been hacked, and I get messages that appear to be from people I know.  Avast has kept me from opening several malicious files that arrived this way."
0,"I just deleted this program from my computer.  Prior to purchasing, searched mult. evals stating easy to use.  BUNK!!!!<br />Very complicated, NOT beginner friendly. Mainly purchased so I could play with different landscaping options.  Took many, many hours to just lay out the property boundary, it's 3 acres and irregularly shaped. Tried to work on deck layout today. clicked on &#34;add new stair&#34; and the program put in 8 separate stairways to the deck, including 4 that came through the walls into the house.

1,"Well, since a few years Norton is the primary security application in many computers that I have and some computers that I fix, when I recommend to my customers buy Norton are very satisfied using it.."
0,I would not recommend this product to anyone.
0,This is a HORRIBLE program and it would get 0 stars if that was available but since there is no &#34;0&#34; rating I will say 1--I hate it.
1,"I purchased because I HAD to get a document to work while I was off sick and my Dell computer did not comp equipped with this software.  SInce I have purchased, I haven't had problems with it and I am glad to finally have this feature."
0,"difficult to use, the start up default map is somewhere in Maine, and it did not auto pick up on my GPS device. Not user friendly in any quick way. Don't misspell anything. It wouldn't be so bad if the default map was the U.S.A, so you could just zoom in on a location. too complicated for car nav."
1,"I Highly Recommend Cook'n .  I am currently using Cook'n 10 and looking forward to upgrading to Cook'n 11.<br /><br />Have been using the software about a year now and have created a HUGE data base of recipes and purchased cookbooks.  I am adding or editing recipes almost daily.  There are multiple ways to easily add or import different recipes from email and the web and it is a lot of fun.  Once added, the recipes look great all the various themes available.  There are wonderful extra features such as the ability to create a pdf cookbook from your recipes.<br /><br />I especially like the ease of use to import and edit recipes.  I also love the category tags used to cross reference and display recipes.<br /><br />Customer and Technical support has been wonderful... and the software is always being improved upon.<br /><br />I am also a member of the Cook'n Club and participate in forums and get monthly free cookbooks and weekly newsletters.  It is a whole lot of fun for someone like me who enjoys collecting recipes.<br /><br />Last but not least, Cook'n automatically creates backup files and also backs up all your recipes to the \\""cloud\\"" so I feel safe collecting as many recipes as I like.<br /><br />I love using Cook'n and cannot recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />P.S.  I often import recipes into Cook'n and then copy and paste to send off to various recipe email lists I participate in.  Very often I get positive comments on how nice the recipes are formatted and asking what I use!"
1,"If you're associated with a college or university, this is a great deal - 4 years, 2 copies, for $79, how can you beat that?  Microsoft will come out with another version in 3 years, so it'll be time to upgrade anyhow."
0,Purchased at Amazon.  Would not download.  Of course no refund on software downloads.  Total rip off.
1,"I love Turbo Tax! For the most part, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. It makes completing my tax return myself, a snap."
1,"Very satisfied with the functions, both personal and Business.<br />2014 bugs were corrected very quicklly.<br />Interfaces with financial organizations are error-free.<br /><br />I have, however, been waiting for the ability to print envelopes from the address book.<br />This feature is in the software but does not work - only the return address prints on the envelope.<br />Correction was promised in the 2013 release and now it still does not work in the 2014 version."
1,"I read all the reviews, good and bad. It seems that most of the problems are with download using Vista.  I use XP, dowloaded without a problem and was able to download the state file as well. Input all data without a problem, printed forms and e-filed the Federal. It is a good product at a reasonable price. As good as, if not better than TurboTax at half the price. I recommend it for all XP users."
1,"Works exactly as it should, and anyone who has used Malwarebytes knows it works perfectly. Add a lifetime prescription for this price and you have all the protection you need."
1,Very good virus protection.  Definitely would buy again.
1,Avast has worked well for me for many years now - never had a problem in all this time - thank you Avast!
0,It is a difficult program to navigate in. I was using quicken with an hp laptop and never had any issues. Not sue if it's the Mac version or because I was using a version from 2013
1,Just what I needed! Nice product.
0,It's okay.
0,"I had previously owned this product on a G4 Dual Core and decided to buy the product for my Powerbook.  First, although the company is aware of problems with installation due to permissions, they don't offer this information until they're contacted after the install failed. After installation, MANY of my previously working bookmarks erred off saying the Operation wasn't permitted. There was no workaround and I couldn't afford to lose so man working links so I deactivated, then deleted the package. I STILL had problems until I found an Uninstall program. What an absolute disaster. This product bears no comparison to their older program which performed flawlessly. Save yourself hours of trouble and having to uninstall anyway, not to mention the monetary loss."
1,Norton products have always been my choice over the years and I have no issues with it slowing down my system.
0,Cannot use the runtime download with it and the current instructions do not work.  The runtime for Access 2007 does not work on Windows 8.1.  Microsoft is awarded an F on its software.
0,"Quicken sucks just like all the other Intuit products!<br />Is slow, poorly designed, not intuitive and expensive!<br />Come on Intuit you cannot even fix the scroll menu to move the right direction? It has been scrolling the wrong way for at least 5 years..."
1,I originally order this software for the first time for 2008 and like it so much I ordered the 2009 version. Each year I prepare a limited number of personal and business income tax returns and have found that this software helps make tax preparation easier. I especially like the five free electronic filings. It is just the right number for me.
0,"Purchased Turbotax Deluxe & Business 2014 for S Corporations.  After spending over $150 on this combination of software, I learned that an upgrade to the Premier version was required at additional cost.  While my frustration was fresh, I purchased the H&R Block package including Premier & Business for $44.  Download was smooth and I had no difficulty using the software.  I've used Turbotax for over 20 years but will no longer pay them a premium.  Goodbye Turbotax"
0,"Forced to change over to this from Norton 360 which was much more stable and feature-rich. Typically for scum-sucking Norton, they fail to mention that Norton Security has stripped out all the Norton Utilities-type features that were found in 360 and one must now buy those separately. Am finding that many of the bells and whistles are not keeping up with Firefox, etc."
1,I love it
1,"I bought this to replace the Cyberlink software that came with my LG Drive, which would not work with the drive (go figure). On a whim I tried WinDVD and found I really preferred this software, it has a better design than the competition and at lower price."
0,Is a pretty good program.  It does have major issue with my HSA.  It will not sysnc with my HSA at all and if download my statements from the HSA it doesn't keep track of the investment portion of the account.  After reading up on this in the forums this problem is very dependent on your HSA provider.  The other issue is with some of the banking institutions.  I can access and pay bills on all of my accounts from the web no problem but to get them to sync with quicken you need to pay a fee.  In my case am able to sync to quicken but not use the bill pay feature without paying a monthly fee.  I am not sure if this is a quicken problem or if it is just a way for the banks to make more money.  Ultimately Quicken doesn't work quite as advertised without some additional hidden costs.
1,"Avast! saved my butt many times, both flagging nasty emails and intercepting viruses on contaminated web sites.  A regular HDD scan often finds more suspicious gems which may come from new software installs.  I've been using it for many years and love it!"
1,Worked well. No problems. Certainly better than using the paper government forms!
1,Slightly expensive way to save tax info
1,"It's a very good antivirus to use. Have used it for past 4 years. But recently downloaded a malware (malwarebytes) program, which found a couple of bugs on different occasions... that Avast did not find. But Avast always catches any viruses... and that's just the FREE version. Just hope they get better with catching malware and such."
0,"Turbotax is usually seamless, but not so this time.  It has trouble reading online bank accounts and investments, resulting in some rather large numerical errors.  Maybe the upgrades before tax time will resolve the issues; one can only hope.<br /><br />Addition to this review on 02/19/2013:  I think that the problems encountered above were due to my banks' websites.  I would upgrade Turbotax to a 5*."
1,"What can i say im pretty careless when on the internet, ignoring warnings and proceeding when i shouldnt. This program has already stoped atleast 5 threats and i have only had for 3 weeks plus my computer runs faste"
1,"I have been using QuickBooks Pro for years and I've always have been very happy with the capabilities that it has with all the various reports that can be used.  It's a user friendly software for those that might be first time users.  The updates to the software have made my job easier and improved with the additional alerts and reminders.  The new Icon bar is a great new addition also, along with the improvement to the user interface.  I will always continue to use QuickBooks especially because of the cost of this software is affordable.  Thanks Debby"
0,Does not even deserve a star! The download does not work!
1,Very easy to use!  Wonderful price and comes with 5 free e-files.  Perfect!
0,I paid for a 1 year of Norton ingternet protection.  What was downloaded was a TRIAL for 30 days ... then I would have to purchase again.  This is robbery.
1,"As a long time user of Norton 360 I've been hearing it is going to be replaced with Norton Security, so I decided to give it a test run and download this 60 day trial. Norton Security has everything 360 has with a modern UI except 'Registry Cleanup' which I really liked but can work around without it.<br />It runs without slowing your computer down. It will warn you about malicious attacks and stop them from ever getting to your files. Norton Security comes with 'Power Eraser' to remove sneaky embedded types of malware like the homepage re-direct<br /><br />Norton Security also has Identity Safe - which remembers all your passwords and auto fills all websites that require a password. When my subscription expires on N360 I plan on replacing it with Norton Security"
0,"Wouldn't load on my Macbook.  Tried their customer support, but they make up to 48hr + to respond.  Unreal.  Will never buy another product from this manufacturer again"
1,"I had been running ENOD32 for a long time.  I switched to Norton Antivirus and it found 12 items that were missed by the \\""other\\"" brand.  All I can say is.... I am sold, and will convert my end users to Norton Antivirus ASAP."
1,"This is my first time to own a business and QuickBooks has been amazing.  Very intuitive, and the payroll feature particularly has been a lifesaver!  Overall QuickBooks makes my record keeping so easy. I highly recommend it!"
0,"This is the first I have done my own taxes in 10 years, so don't have much experience w/ this software or competing brands. Price went up $3-4 on Amazon since I looked at it the first time, then went up  another $2 when I wrote this review, so buy early? Extra state e-file $19.95 charge brings actual total up to about $65 for turbo tax deluxe.  3 updates downloaded, 2 at first and 3rd a week after I was mostly done, but coming back to review it. The first 2 updates went fine. After the 3rd I went back through Federal. Something w/ child care credits or child care expenses, caused it to take $500 off fed refund. Then it crashed, and I lost that version without saving. I went through it again but never saw the refund reduction or issues in child care segment. I lost trust w/ the software after this. I am thinking I don't want to file too soon in case there are more software updates? I filed on Feb 12. Also,  It shows Form 1116 for foreign taxes, but I shouldn't need to file it, it was confusing whether TT was going to attach it or not. In the end it didnt attach it which was fine.  It printed 35 pages at review stage prior to e-file, including gray/purple colored graphics hash on some pages, so the cost was higher due to printer cartridge. It double printed the federal forms and attachments. Needs to have options for which forms you want to print. Definitely, don't need W-2s and other forms i receive in the mail printed again. The state form wasn't as refined/didn't provide as much detail to help, like easy guide on Federal. I may try tax act next year, or pay a $75 live body preparer, since the cost w/ e-file and printing materials is about the same. Or I will investigate the premium version cost that includes state e-file."
1,This product works well on my HP laptop with Intel i5 processor.  Processing speed seems to not be slowed down too much by the security software.  Price from Amazon was lower than from Norton at the time of purchase
1,"I've used the H&R Block program for my small S-corporation during the past 3 years. After reading the negative reviews for the 2013 Business program, I was hesitant to purchase this version even though it is substantially less expensive than the better reviewed Turbo Tax program. I decided to take a chance on it and I'm glad that I did. Installation of the downloaded version for both programs (Personal & Business) was painless. I updated the business program (took a little while) and began my return. I had very little issue with completing my return. From download to transmitting the return was a couple of hours.<br /><br />My corporate return is fairly simple so I cannot comment about how the program would do with a more complicated situation. My experience was positive. Glad I decided to save the $$ over the other option.<br /><br />My only negative has nothing to do with the software. It is the complete insane complexity of the tax code.<br /><br />Now if the personal program works as well, this will have been a good choice."
0,Will not connect to any banks to download ha ve tgo use b ank website to download  In to program should ha ve left itg alone.  Junk program will not do as intended use  Peachtree or microsoft money much better programs
1,"I chose this eFile program with H&R Block because it keeps me from having to figure out all the information from the Tax Booklet every year.  I've been using it for several years before this one and wouldn't dream of using another one.  Easy, easy, easy."
0,you have to copy and past and copy and paste to download more then one video ....flv you can download the whole playlist
1,"I was hesitant to buy Dragon Dictate after checking out the reviews, but now that I've been working with it for a week I'm very glad I took the risk. Yes, the program was very frustrating for the first few days while I &#34;trained&#34; it to recognize my voice, but the accuracy improved every day and now I would guess that it's about 90-95% accurate, which is perfectly acceptable for what I use it for. I have found that my Mac's built in mic doesn't do so well with the dictation portion of the program so I would recommend checking into a mic upgrade if this is what you'll be using Dragon for. I dictate into a handheld recorder (Olympus brand) and then use the transcription function to get my words on the screen, and this is proving to be a huge time save for me now that I've struggled through the initial training process. My advice, don't get frustrated. Give yourself a week or two of working with the program before you decide to kick it to the curb. I don't think Dragon is for everyone, but for those people who have the patience to stick with it, the program can be a really valuable tool."
1,I Use it every year work's great
1,"I like Quicken, always have.  I jumped on this Q2015 bandwagon because of the hype about being able to go to your mobile device.  I have Blackberry, Q. doesn't support it.  I have, however,  found a way to run Android apps on my Blackberry.  ...and this is not about that.  I can use the mobile app, and have no problems with it.<br />My problem lies within Quicken itself.  or should I say, 2015.  with today's mobile world, I need to have Q. available at home, and when I travel.  When I travel overnight, no problem,  I just update when I get home.  When I travel for a week or more,  I take my laptop.  There in lies the problem.<br />I have Q2015 on my desktop at home, and on my laptop.  ( the license agreement says nothing about more than one computer.)  However, I can only have one Mobile, or Cloud, if you will, account, so I can connect to my mobile device,  ie. the Blackberry.  It would be better, if the two installs, home, and laptop, would work more together.  That is why the 9.  Over all I like Quicken and will continue to use it, despite this shortcoming."
1,Very nice software i like it.  Not using a lot of computer source. Good and helpful to protect my computer
0,"I was asked by our company accountant to buy QB Pro and Enhanced Payroll.<br />THIS VERSION DOES NOT ALLOW UNLIMITED CHECKS LIKE THE ENHANCED PAYROLL 2014 THAT YOU CAN BUY ALONE.<br />This &#34;Value&#34; pack does not offer value to everyone.<br /><br />Now, I'm having to buy the full version of Enhance Payroll even though I already paid more for this &#34;value&#34; pack, initially.<br />Intuit, you could use some help with your naming systems.  You should call this something like Payroll Lite or Not-so-useful Payroll.<br /><br />I was asked to return this but I know it might be impossible."
1,Great product. Great price and easy installation.
1,Been using this product for the last 4 years. Guides you through everything. Saves me hundreds of dollars a year.
0,I cannot believe they have not applied ability to place transactions for automatic payment from list of payees.
1,"I just want to say that I had no problem downloading, installing or activating this download of Quickbooks Pro 2010. I am running Windows XP and upgraded from Quickbooks Pro 2007. I was a little leary after reading the other reviews, but am glad that I didn't listen to them. It took 23 min to download, 6 min to install, 5 min to call and get the validation code. The operator verified information that he already had and didn't ask me for any additional information. He did speak broken English, but I had no problem understanding him, he was very pleasant. I haven't researched what the upgrades are in 2010 yet and I agree that I don't like them telling me that I have to upgrade if I want to continue to use payroll which I have to pay extra for the subscription, but to be honest, I had intended to upgrade anyway so it wasn't a big deal. I started out with the 1999 version of Quickbooks and have tried other software over the years, there is no comparison so all in all I am very happy with Quickbooks and will continue to use their software. I was just waiting for a decent price and Amazon came through."
0,"I have 2 computers. 1 is windows 7 , 1 is windows 8 , won't download on either computer!!"
1,This program finds a lot of  malware and what not that antivirus programs never seem to pick up. I had two different programs that told me everything was fine. Yeah right.. Buy the lifetime subscription because  they don't even do this anymore on the website.
1,"I could say it was easy but it wasn't completely. I had questions that felt like I could answer in more ways than one, but H&R had alot of good information on their website and with some research I got it all done and have a better appreciation about doing your own taxes.<br /><br />With all that said, I was very happy with the Software I really liked the fact I could log-in to my Scottrade account (I'm not rich I just dabble :p) and have all my information uploaded in a few seconds with no effort (my original tax lady complained about how hard it was to do the stocks section of my taxes and charged me more because of it... in your face tax lady person!)<br /><br />Back to the review. I would defiantly recommend this to family and friends that want to take control of their financial life. It's not the easiest thing in the world but it's simple and makes things less intimidating than what someone new might originally think.<br /><br />Best of all... E-File and direct deposit!! I got about the same money back than my old tax lady got me and I didn't have to pay half a grand to do it... yes half a grand. Never going back to that again!!"
1,"Helpfull program for my computer. I really liked it. I will order another program in the future again. Thank you,"
1,"I'm a longtime, loyal Quicken user, from the early 90's.  I've recommended the product to more people than I can remember over the years.  I never write reviews, but I have to this time to explain the issue I'm having with this version.  I'm using H & B 2011 on another laptop.  For my new laptop, I don't want to install an old version, so I downloaded the 2014 H & B on the new computer.  As far as I can see, there is no way for 2014 H & B to convert the 2011 data file.  .  It tries to restore from a backup.  Okay, I made a backup from the old computer but 2014 converts the file, then goes right back to the convert form backup screen. It won't read the converted data file.  From reading Quicken support FAQ's the problem is the new computer still needs to read the data from the 2011 backup version.  Okay, I tried to install the 2014 version on the old computer then make a backup.  Doesn't work, I already downloaded the file from Amazon once and can't download it again.  Okay, I try to install the 2011 version on the new computer then open the file.  Doesn't work either, the 2011 installer has to uninstall the 2014 version and this creates an error message.  So I'm left with no way to use the program or open my file.  Time and $ wasted. How many people buy new computers and then want to upgrade their software?  I suspect very many.  Why doesn't Quicken accommodate this scenario?  I can't recommend this product anymore.<br /><br />Update: reinstalled the program and followed the steps more carefully to convert the file.  I can't explain what I did differently this time, but it worked and the program is now working fine.<br />I'll stick with Quicken as I have many years of data and successful use."
1,"I have been purchasing this product every year for at least a decade.  Will continue to do so, it handles all of the details and lets me choose from legal options to pay what I owe.  The e-file works great, PDF copies for my records with all detailed forms and worksheets completed automatically, and this year, Intuit and amazon had a sweet deal where I got 10% bonus on my fed refund through amazon points.  Win, win, and win."
1,I have been using Quicken Delux for many years and think it is the Greatest!!!!
0,"Couldn't enter 1099-B as instructions/interview do/does not refer to boxes on form. Couldn't import some documents, and for those that if did import, could not see account numbers in order to discern which account was which. Help Chat did not respond for over an hour, then I received an email indicating I had accessed help. Tried help by phone, but rep. had no idea how to help. This was not a tax question, but a question of how to get software to accept entries, and where.<br /><br />I had tried it, as I saw bad reviews for this year's TurboTax. Finally, was unable to proceed at all. Purchased Turbo Tax and am requesting refund from H&R Block. I've been told I have 6o days after purchase to request refund, but we'll see what happens."
0,"This product does not support IRS Form 1099-S, \\""Proceeds From Real Estate Transactions.\\"" What made this purchase especially frustrating was the fact that I specifically inquired about this with TurboTax Customer Service/Help before my Amazon purchase. Once the Amazon TurboTax software was purchased and loaded, a listing of supported IRS forms was made available; too late in this case."
1,This program seems to do a good job of watching for potential viruses. I feel more confident since we installed it.
0,Too many bugs with the online version.  Never did get it to work right. Called helpline and had them work on it with me but no success.  Went to Taxact online instead
0,"I just wanted to warn everyone that as of 9:41 a.m. CST on January 31, 2012 nothing has been fixed on the 1099 forms including the insipid \\""Houston we have a problem...\\"" error message despite the assurances of the VP at Intuit on some of the other comments.  As a side comment you may experience more problems using Firefox as your browser going through the 1099 filing that you might using IE or Chrome.  At one point it even recommended that I use Chrome for in-browser PDF support although that part worked fine with Firefox.  As I was having trouble entering new 1099's I got the impression that the software was having browser issues.  I switched to IE and was able to complete my work without any further trouble.  I still will not change my ratings though.  This whole thing was poorly thought out by Intuit.  The website is extremely slow and the in-browser Java scripts that run on the page have a hard time carrying out their tasks for instance deciding if you have an EIN or SS# and whether you have a company or an individual that you are sending a 1099 for."
1,"I have used Turbo Tax the past three or four years, and I am glad it's available every year.  The first year you need to add all your personal info, but year 2 it transfers or imports your info from the previous year, so it's quite faster in year two.  I even help my family members out by doing their taxes.  You get five free federal filings (free e-filings) and one free state e-file return.  I don't image switching products any time soon.  Great product and really easy to use."
0,"I did some research on design software for the PC, and found some favorable reviews for this product. I then made the mistake of just going ahead and dropping $70 to download it without first doing a free trial.    This product is, quite simply, maddening. I can only guess that ChiefArchitect's real focus is their high-end stuff and this is just a loss leader, but I've taught myself a lot of software over the years, and this product is flat-out user spiteful.    I've struggled with it for three weeks now, and keep dumbing down my house design so that I can at least get the roof to resemble what I've designed, and it's still not working. It's buggy, gives me error messages that are incorrect, and is a real hair puller.     Maybe it will work for your project, but try it first if you can."
0,If you use a Discover card and use Quicken Premier to reconcile your account - BEWARE!  This new Quicken 2012 Premier never marks off what has been previously downloaded!  Results - the same entries over and over again.  A huge hassle and absolutely no resolution in site.

1,I have been using this product for 8 years and wouldn't consider using anything else. It is quick and yet gives me confidence that my return is correct.
0,"This product has been horrible this far. I have been a long time user , through multiple versions , and multiple areas in the application hang on me.  I am in IT by trade , and haven't been able to get though the issues.  Support has been horrible I and am very unhappy with the product ."
1,"Great Internet Security service! i highly recommend AVAST to as many of my friends as possible!<br />in the year that my friend has recomended AVAST,i've seen outstanding improvement on my computer<br />and its Firewall security-Thank You AVAST for your expert product!!"
1,"Year after year (with the exception of the year they included hidden tracking software), TurboTax delivers what is promised."
0,"Have used Quicken in the past and have been most satisfied.  The 2013 version is disappointing at best.  Will be requesting a refund.  Admittedly, I am not a computer geek but not a computer illiterate.  Your programmers need to think simple!!  This product has me lost."
0,"I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.    I had to email \\""customer support,\\"" since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.      I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!"
1,"I thought it would be a pain in the neck to upgrade to 2015 on a Mac, but it was almost instantaneous!  The new Quickbooks had all my info in no time."
1,Great service and product.
1,"Great software, easy to use"
1,Download was quick & easy. Have used it on my Mac for excel and so far so good! It's as good as it was on my PC
0,"I started using Quicken for Windows back in the early '90s. In 2007 I switched from a PC to a Mac. Of course we all know that Intuit basically abandoned Quicken Mac users. I refuse to run Windows on my Mac, either via an emulator such as Parallels or a Bootcamp partition. If I wanted to run PC software, I'd own a PC. Quicken for Mac 2007 was somewhat of a joke and while Quicken Essentials for Mac is obviously written for the Mac and has a pretty interface, it's &#34;lame&#34; at best. Next came Quicken for Mac 2015. Boy, was I excited about this software, as a longtime Quicken user. I downloaded it earlier this week and although my data transferred over seamlessly from Quicken Essentials for Mac, what a giant NIGHTMARE/DISAPPOINTMENT this long awaited software has been. I was very pumped about being able to sync my data between my iPad/iPhone and my iMac/MacBook Pro. WRONG! I had to choose between my iMac and my MacBook Pro to sync with my iPad/iPhone. Of course the ability to sync to more than one Mac &#34;is coming in a future update.&#34; You must be kidding me! As others have said, this software was released LONG before it was ready for prime time. The first deal killer for me though was how SLOOOOOOOOOW the program loaded (I'm using a new 13-inch MacBook Pro w/Retina Display 2.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 16GB 1600MHz RAM). When you open the program in the dock, it often times takes in excess of 20 seconds for the program to open! Syncing your Mac to Quicken's cloud is also glacier slow and BUGGY often times getting messages saying that it could not sync because of an error with one of your Quicken categories. Try it later in the day and it might work. Go figure. Tech support is NON-EXISTENT! Intuit has this EXTREMELY LAME online chat site that is TOTALLY WORTHLESS. Quicken Essentials for Mac is rather childish, but at least it loads quickly and can handle many of the simple tasks I ask it to do. The reviews on this software can best be summed up in five words, DON'T BUY IT NOW, WAIT. I've stayed away from other Mac financial software thinking sooner or later Intuit would produce a worthy product. THIS ISN'T IT! I guess it's time to look at iBank 5 or possibly one of the other ones. Intuit/Quicken just lost a longtime, loyal customer. I finally found the link to request a refund (not easy) on one of Intuit's chat sites. My credit card has been credited and Quicken for Mac 2015 has been completely removed from my hard drive on both my iMac and my 13-inch MacBook Pro w/Retina Display. I also deleted the Quicken Apps on my iPhone/iPad. My Quicken for Mac 2015 nightmare (read lots of wasted time) is now over! I'm one happy guy!"
1,IT HAS SAVED MY COMPUTER SO MANY TIMES.
1,Worked as expected
1,"My family has used the free Avast in the past, but we chose to pay this time because of the volume of work we do and since we use so many public wi-fi hotspots. Avast has not failed us. In fact, we now use it on our phone for free and we plan to upgrade further in the future."
0,"I've used this tax program since it was Macintax, and this year it didn't include my operating system. On top of the expense of upgrading the operating system, for the first time had to buy the state tax separately. Turbotax outdid themselves with all their different attempts to make more money -- but they lost a lot of respect from former customers who expected better."
1,"I had a serious problem with Quicken 2014.  I went back to Quicken 2012, which did not have the problem.  This<br />2015 version fixes that bug.  Before you could not delete a transaction between two IRA accounts (such as a brokerage account and sweep account).  I agree with the reviewer who said he didn't want new features just fix the bugs. (although the x-ray feature is very nice.)  I now recommend the program.  For me the conversion process was smooth and fast.  It probably depends on your amount of history.  Having painfully moved back to an earlier version, my history was short."
1,"The seller was quick and on time. Great purchase, would definitely do business with seller again. Thanks"
1,I have been using Avast for 4 years now and I haven't come by a better software to track and hunt down malicious ware better than Avast.
0,"This is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />1) They have stripped out features that used to exist, at all levels, in order to force you into buying a higher level<br />2) The software makes frequent and gross errors in dealing with MLPs<br />3) There are bugs in the software, resulting in incorrect calculations<br />4) It crashes<br />5) There is no support.<br />6) Just to repeat - THERE IS NO SUPPORT - other than groupies who may / may not know what they are talking about"
0,"Avast is a Virus! Their whole communication system is overwrought and intentionally complicated, its a very SHADY company, after spending 60 worthless minutes on the phone with these &#34;people' i was advised that I would have to pay $77 for getting my comp in order, I told that &#34;lady&#34; where to stuff it i am pretty savvy and have good &#34;scam antenna&#34; but i feel sorry for the ones who fall for this thievery. They actually asked me questions like &#34;do you do your banking on this computer&#34;? Do you have financial records? Imagine this. Creeps!"
1,Been amazing product to help me. Just starting photography and this really helps me add to my portfolio. I enjoy the quick edit and the guided is there as I'm not as familiar with editing a lot of pictures.
1,"This is a great WYSIWYG web design app. It is very easy for beginners and has plenty of power for professionals as well. It is supported by a ton of Actions for everything from rollovers and target layers to PayPal and Blogger support and right down to favicons. For example, to create a rollover button, align your rollover images, group them, and apply the rollover action. To create a link to a page or anchor, just hit command-k and select the target page from a list. This is also a fairly intelligent app. If you change the name or URL of a page or an anchor, all the links pointing at it are automatically updated.    This is an easy enough app that I created a recipe site for my wife (an extreme hater of technological stuff), showed her how easy it is to create a new category page and recipe page from the masters and how to add links, and then I set her at it. She is tooling right along and having a blast.    Cascading style sheets are easy to set up by simply adding attributes from pop-up lists and punching in the settings. This is enhanced by adding extended attributes, such as adding responsive background photos, etc. You can also insert code such as keywords, page descriptions, Google Analytics, webfonts, etc. You can easily drop in such things as videos, HTML5 animations, iFrames, javascripts and more.    It should be noted that this is not a HTML app in the traditional sense, in that you can't easily input an HTML page from elsewhere. Rather, it generates clean HTML code (both verbose and concise) during the build / upload process. While you normally work in Page mode (WYSIWYG), you can click on a preview tab for a preview with working rollovers, (although the links do not function). For a fully-functioning preview you can select your browser and then click on the browser preview button generate the site on the fly.    Freeway also comes with Showcase - an extremely easy to use dedicated photo gallery app. Drop in your photos, set the attributes, add the Showcase action to your page and off you go. CSS menu creation is also very easy. Just create a list in an HTML box, set the attributes in the CSS menu action window, then select the menu items and attach a link.    If you want to add a blog to your site, create a page based on your master (or a new page), including menus and everything else, then insert and resize the desired blog component (text, directory, etc.) on the page and apply your preferred styles via the Actions window. This will serve as a master, rather than a portal. Hit the preview button and click on a button in the Actions window to copy the code to your clipboard. Go to Blogger, set up an account and throw on a page based on any random Blogger template and the switch to code view, then replace the existing code with that on your clipboard. When you upload the site, your blog is ready to go.    Support is absolutely first-rate and the user community is booming. You can usually get several responses to a post within an hour or so. There are also several great online sources for Freeway actions that add even more functionality.    I have only two caveats about Freeway: First, when you have a large site with a lot of actions applied and/or a huge Showcase gallery, it tends to reupload a lot of content rather than just the new or altered content. Second, version 6 introduced a ton of relative-named terms in the Inspector that can be confusing (such as flexible vs stretchy).    The current version (7) also adds interactive layouts that change the layout to conform to the screen sizes of various moblie devices. Just set a pixel width for each device then reposition elements or bring in different elements. The layout (including menus) will automatically switch. You can set up as many sizes as you want, but this can become problematic when you are working with a large site having a ton of pages. You will also have to save often, because sometimes the app can get confused if you have too much going on with thismulti-layout content.    In closing, let me say that I work in a corporate setting and I started off way back when with Adobe PageMill and then moved on to GoLive and then to DreamWeaver. After reviewing Freeway 3 for a magazine article way back when, I found that Freeway could handle just about everything while not becoming a kludge like DW. Since then, I switched the corporate site to Freeway and our tech guy has also used Freeway to set up an extensive training and help site, complete with around sixty videos that are streamed by a third-party service. I've been using FW on a professional basis for years now. The combination of Freeway, Tumult Hype (for HTML5 interactive content), Photoshop, and a video streaming service provides everything I need to make a huge impact. Beyond this, javascript and Jquery content is freely available on the web and, with a small amount of homework, it is easy to insert this and customize.    Grizzled veterans may turn up their noses at Freeway, but I don't care. Freeway makes it possible for me to create and maintain attractive, powerful, feature-packed websites and maintain them very easily. I have plenty of other responsibilities to handle and having Freeway makes it possible for me to handle my sites without taking time from my other duties."
0,i live in egypt and i got this product (Adobe Photoshop Elements 10) as a gift from a friend who lives in USA .. but after i download it and instal it on my pc .. i got it's not opening and gives error message .
0,Have used this program (windows version) some seven years ago as a professional landscape designer and it was not too bad....the mac version sucks big time.
1,"This product was very easy to purchase on Amazon, and it exceeded my expectations for Tax Software."
1,Works well
0,"I have used Norton products for years on numerous computers.  The program can be glitchy, then its hard to fixxy, last time I updated, works fine on the desktop, glitchy on the laptop, many.......hours into trying to find the remedy,  if you enjoy being aggrevated buy it"
1,Don't buy Word Perfect... I wasted $45 trying to save the added cost for Word... OOOoops  This program is so much better and easier to use...  I have used Word from the very beginning -- so what was I thinking!  Do yourself a favor use Word.
1,"Very easy to use, has many options. Great price for start-up company! The only set back is that it is difficult to get a hold of costumer service sometimes."
0,"Turbotax  cost me my return. For the first time ever, I waited last minute to file with the confidence TT would easily guide me through... As it has before. On Tuesday I was on the phone for several hours trying to get help from them just to &#34;log in&#34;. Wed over 6 hours as I watched the clock ticking away. ( I resigned myself to rely upon the promise on their home page that an extension was easily a click away).. My TT helper tried to get the site to let me log in promising me she would stick with me.. Then about five min till midnite.. She gave up. I frantically opted to extend but  then after two pages later saw where TT will PRINT you an extension and YOU have to mail it in..! BAD BAD BAD that &#34;logging in&#34; screwed up my taxes and now I have no idea what to do since I failed to send in an extension"
1,"Product works fine, but translating it from the Amazon download has created some problems requiring resolution and correction.  Moreover, not immediately recognized by more than one computer."
1,The quicken is great for keeping track of all expenditures. I use it for mostly balancing my bank and visa accounts (to  see if any weird charges show up) and to keep a monthly report of where I spend my money. Great if you have to budget each month and try to maintain a goal.
0,"I was skeptical of the bad reviews of this product, but gave it a try none-the-less. It seems to be the same as Quicken Essentials for Mac, with a bit of an updated interface. I don't understand why features that work on Mint (another Intuit product) don't work on Quicken 2015 for Mac. Many of my financial institutions available on Mint are not available on Q15, such as American Funds or MOHELA student loans. Nor does Q15 allow automatic downloads like Mint. (My beef with Mint is that we can't upload past transactions or change names of accounts). I'm very disappointed."
1,I have used it for years and I've not had any issues. only those who overstep their safety bounds have issues
1,The product is really great and I use it year after year however this year I was self-employed (contractor)<br />.<br />If your not careful to get the right version you may not be getting all the deduction possible. I myself did not realize that self employment requires the Home+Business version.<br /><br /> I noticed some of the things I was told I could deduct &#34;from fellow contractors&#34; did not show up in the deluxe version till I got the Home + Business version. The sad part is that the deluxe version will let you claim self-employment but at no time did it stop and tell me I could be missing deduction because of limits on that version of the software.
1,It's nice to have a place to store my E-books purchased from Amazon!
1,"I am a first time Mac owner, but long-time Office user. I wasn't sure what to expect when merging the two, but was pleasantly surprised by the reviews, and how quickly Office Mac downloaded after purchasing it. The suite comes with Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (and includes and icon for Outlook, but you will need to pay extra to activate it). I primarily use Excel for accounting purposes, and the program functions like it would on a PC. The main difference being the keyboard, and I would recommend an external keyboard that has a numerical pad.<br /><br />I use Word less frequently than Excel, but its comparable to what you would experience using a PC.I haven't used PowerPoint (and really don't have the need to), so I have no thoughts on its comparability with the PC version of PowerPoint.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product -  especially if you are used to working with these programs on a PC, are a new Mac user, and want something more than what Apple Pages and Numbers can do for you."
0,"I thought since it said Federal and State \\""AND\\"" I purchased the software, I would not have to pay the 19.95 to send it in. Wrong.  I looked through the documentation and could not find anywhere they said that would be a charge.  So I spent 39.79 for something I could have done for free through my bank.  I could have also done my State free on my States website.  I didn't mind paying the 39.79 for the software as it is very easy to use but the added 19.95 to send it in really irked me.  It's of course free if you want to print it out and send it in but then why bother buying the software.  My opinion, if you can do your taxes somewhere else, I would. The 59.74 wasn't really worth it."
1,I found it to be as or more effective than the system I paid for in the past. Pleas e try it!
0,"I am writing this review from the standpoint of a software developer/sysadmin. Basic users running the same set of well-known programs day in and day out might not experience the issues described below.<br /><br />* As a software developer I re-compile various EXEs 20-30 times a day. Each time, WRSA freezes my PC for 2-3 minutes while it analyzes the newly compiled EXE, and I really mean freeze, no task manager, nothing available.<br />* Extremely aggressive scanning of programs being launched via another program/script (even previously launched EXEs). Running a typical sysadmin tool such as FinalBuilder with WRSA means that build scripts will fail 50% of the time with WRSA causing an \\""Invalid File Handle\\"" error as it aggressively hogs the file being accessed.<br /><br />The above type of issues are par for the course with many other security suites, but what distinguishes (in a bad sense) WRSA from others is that it is impossible to tweak the basic settings to exclude some folders. The WRSA team on the forum is actually quite dismissive, even arrogant, telling anyone who asks for the option to exclude some folders that they don't know what's best for themselves.<br /><br />Finally, these issues of extreme aggressive have been getting worse and worse over the one year that I have use WRSA and the latest major update (done automatically, without asking you) is a total nightmare. Basically, to do any type of debugging, or run any consequent build script, I need to shut-down WRSA, which kind of defeats the purpose of a security suite..<br /><br />To be fair, WRSA does come in a small lightweight installation package, and installation is quick and painless (no reboot, first time I've seen this for a security suite). But it is basically a \\""cloud\\"" solution which is designed with the \\""we know best what's good for you\\"" attitude and which has gotten more and more inappropriate for me as an IT professional and software developer."
0,"I have used turbotax for many years.  However, this year the software crashes so often that it is basically unusable.  I will not be purchasing again next year.  I'm an IT person, so have done all the troubleshooting, updating etc. to no avail.  I would not recommend this product."
1,i have used norton before. but not the 360 it  does more than i expeced when i bought it. i would recco0mend it to ane and every one
0,"I bought it, and they didnt told me that I coudnt use it because I was leaving in another coutry so I couldnt download."
1,I've been using Quicken for a while and I think more people should use it for their budgeting needs and to track their spending.  I have all of our finances loaded into it and it lets me see where we can save and helps me plan for those big purchases or trips.<br /><br />Quicken will help you get a handle on your finances in a time when that is more and more important.
0,"Everyone beware of this Co. I wrote a lengthy review on Ripoff Reports.com.  Many complaints and problems.  Short version, after spending 2 hrs. in my computer, files were missing.  I could not always boot up; sometimes got a black screen.  In safe mode I got a message that files were missing from C drive.  I do not have a back up disk.  My computer is useless.  It is very difficult to get a refund from this Co.  They are set up this way.  Asked for refund before 30 days were up. They have a ticket system that is impossible to use.  Sent them an email from a neighbors computer stating I couldn't boot up- please call me. No call.  Finally got a refund after reporting them to the BBB and started a case through my credit card Co. Beware, they will continue charging your card after you have canceled.  These same complaints are on their own website.  There is a male on youtube complaining about the same thing.  He was also working with his Credit Card Co. I should have read reviews  before I got involved."
0,"Our company purchased QB's for the 18th year.  This version has had NUMEROUS errors.  After paying over $1,400.00 for the initial program, Tech Support at Intuit told me that they would be happy to fix our files at an expedited rate of $750.00, Otherwise it would be ready in 5-7 days.  The error is a flaw in the program which they readily admitted.  So... let me get this straight.... I need to pay $750.00 for them to repair their defective product???  They &#34;fixed&#34; the file... OK, so not really... after several attempts the &#34;fixed&#34; file wouldn't open.  I again called Tech Support and after another 30 minutes of trying, they couldn't get the file to open either.  So.... it looks like we get to start over.  I have a 10 user license, an accounting staff of 6 people, and here we sit... waiting.  Can you say Peachtree???"
1,Avast free is excellent! Does not overtake your system like Norton or AVG or kapersky It updates twice a day and does not slow my system down
0,"Given Intuit's audacity for force us to upgrade every few years, the company could at least make some fundamental improvement in the software!<br /><br />Of course since this is a \\""mature\\"" product there are not a lot of features left to add, but they could at least fix shortcomings in the interface of prior versions.<br /><br />Case in point:  The bizarre font sizes (especially if your Windows default is 125%). The 2013 version of Quicken has a huge font size options for those who need enormous fonts and also allows customizing of fonts and font sizes on one bank register screen, but nowhere else. You'd think by now they'd have bothered to allow font size options for all screens."
1,Great way for kids to learn how to type
0,Need to get it to work..
0,I don't know if this product is good or not as I have been unable to install it. I've tried 5 times using different methods and still unable to install. So I've reinstalled 2013.
1,"I purchased Quicken Deluxe when Money no long worked on Windows 10. I was not looking for online support or a complicated program, just something simple to keep track of expenses like Money has done for a number of years.  I was able to transfer all data, relatively seamlessly. There is a small learning curve to adjust to how Quicken works. However, this product fills the need for those looking for a replacement for Money.  I cannot address the effectiveness of online sync to bank accounts as I am not interested in this."
1,"I do recommend this product however... My two gripes with this product so far is we have 4 computers in the house but the license only covers 3. The other thing is the backup user interface could be better. Otherwise it has a very clean and easy to use user interface, covers most of my needs for security, doesn't seem to be a big drain on computer resources (at first I thought it did but it settled down after a few days), and the price was reasonable.<br /><br />My only suggestion is they could dramatically improve the user interface for selecting which files/folders to back up or not. It does provide this feature, it is just a poor user interface for doing so. Norton provides a high level selection for things like email, music, etc backup selections. However if you want to be more specific it gets very tedious and cumbersome to make file and folder selections to include/exclude.<br /><br />I've used better interfaces where a directory tree is displayed with a checkbox next to each file and folder. Check the folder box to include that whole tree for backup (which in turns checks the box next to every file and folder in that tree), uncheck the box to exclude the file or folder.<br /><br />Other than backup I recommend this product. Too bad for me. I was looking for a good backup product when I ran across this. I decided to go for it based on the multiple computer license. I blew away the free virus software I was using so I could switch to this one for the backup capability (Microsoft Windows 7 backup is way too slow and featureless). Turns out the backup is the weakest part of the product.<br /><br />Update October 2, 2011<br />After almost a year I'm again searching for a backup utility. Norton 360 fails me because it does not have incremental backup. It takes about 48 hours to do a backup EVERY time I do one. I'll be picking up a utility that does incremental backups. Any backup program that does not do incremental is simply not worth using.<br /><br />Again I say if you want this program for other than backup then it seems to be fine. But there are other utilities that will do PC security for free. I'll be switching back to the free version of AVG for my security when the current Norton 360 license expires.it seems to be fine. But there are other utilities that will do PC security for free. I'll be switching back to the free version of AVG for my security when the current Norton 360 license expires."
0,"The software works, there are just things it doesn't do that Mint can.  I have to download transactions from my bank and import the file into Quicken.  With Mint, it does that automatically. etc.  Not a bad program, just inconvenient in some respects."
1,I was a little nervous because of some of the negative reviews but took a chance and bought the download. I uninstalled my previous norton software as recommended in other posts and downloaded and installed the software in minutes without any problems. Met my expectations.
1,Great products - both me and my fiance used it and wow does this make doing your taxes less painful.  Highly Recommend
1,"The download was fast and loaded smoothly, I thought Outlook was included in this version but it is not, I think the business version has it included"
1,This is the best AntiVirus around & its Free !! Works very well.No Virus's ever get thru...Totally trust Avast !!!!
0,"The Turbo Tax program worked fine, but I ended up taking my taxes to a CPA because The questions Turbo Tax asked to see what my situation was were too complicated. I think Turbo Tax is OK, but the tax codes are way to complicated."
0,Worth a 5 star except it wants to make changes to my computer every time it loads causing a permission screen to pop up.  Very irritating.  Conversion function excellent.
1,AMAZING! The easiest way to activate your Symantec Norton AntiVirus. RECOMMENDED! No extra fee for send or burn CD.  Just download and activate in one click.
0,just like others cannot log in
1,The software itself is what it is.  Amazon offered the best value.  Microsoft claims I can use the software for the life of the PC.  Not sure if they'll let me re-install if my hard drive ever crashes.
1,"Big improvement over Quicken Essentials, but it's got a few updates to bring it up to snuff with what has been promised.  As an original Beta tester for this product, I believe that the team is headed in the right direction with their promise to provide free updates until the product's promises are met."
1,Turbo tax<br />'nough said
1,"I am not a pro photographer or editor, but I like this software better than corel or others I've tried.  Like all of these types of photo software that I've tried, there is a learning curve and there are quirks that could be improved upon.  But overall, you can do a lot with this software, especially in guided mode."
1,"I've been a Norton user for at least a decade and have been purchasing it from Amazon for the last several years, since they always seem to have the best price.<br /><br />FYI: The price in the fall always seems to be the lowest."
1,A wonderful program for doing most anything you can think of with your photos.
1,"I like it. Used Quicken Essentials for a year or so, and find this a nice upgrade. I don't use the budget at all, and hardly ever the reports, but for day to day tracking of finances I find it efficient. Since I reconcile every day now with the downloaded transactions, &#34;monthly reconcile&#34; has long been a thing of the past. If some fraud in Moscow charges my card now (it happened to me), I know in a day or two.<br /><br />I paid $50 and see the low historically is $44 at camelcamelcamel.com.<br /><br />No regrets, nice electronic checkbook register, and the Android app is a nice added feature.<br /><br />Previously used Moneydance for a couple years, then Essentials, and prefer this over both of them."
1,Simple to use. Works really fast and  Movavi is .very simple to use.Would recommend it to anyone .
0,The fact that after paying full price and we have to pay additional filing fees for electronically filing the State income tax is ludricrous.
1,Waited until I have done two updates to evaluate this and it worked well. Connected easily and downloaded in 1/2 hr. Auto installed in 55 min.
1,I love the way it scans my computer in the background and gives me a report that All is Well.
0,this outlook produce consistently froze. Found others with same issue. Several possible solutions failed. $100 wasted in that Amazon offers no return regardless that it is a bogus product that should never have been offered in a respectable venue.<br />DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,"This video is a great training tool for anyone trying to get going with some basic VBA progamming for Microsoft Access.  Each lesson is narrated with what they are doing and why with easy to follow step by step examples and a summary.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the modules in VBA and how to connect them to access forms, queries etc. Plain english examples and broken down in small steps that you can apply to your own application.  You can get through it all in one day versus trying to read a 200 page manual. You will still need a reference book to help with all the various commands in VBA but this will at least give you the confidence to give it a try."
1,I recently upgraded from Quicken 2013 to Quicken 2014.  I like the upgrade tweaks in Quicken's latest version.  Still very easy to use and meets my financial needs.  I WISH Quicken 2014 would run on both Windows 8 and MAC Mavericks.  Maybe next year?
1,"This download worked perfectly for me, and took about 30 minutes in total. It stopped downloading a couple of times, each for less then a minute, but started back up on its own. My only suggestion is that you print out the key before you start the download, since it makes you quit safari. No complaints, and definitely much cheaper than the download via Microsoft!"
0,Nothing like Quicken 2007. Reports are no existent. No on line banking. Stay away from it. Maybe Moneydance or iBank5 as options.
1,have been using Avast for nearly 2 years now. It is the best one out there and its free
0,Ok rewrite of below. I don't like to quit so I uninstalled norton using remove app from norton and uninstalled my older virus protection. I then installed and updated norton without a problem only 3 stars for now since headache last time. May update later.  Just remember make sure you uninstalled any older virus protection first. Norton fails to mention this.<br /><br />OMG!!!! Nothing but problems right out the gate. Windows 8.1 and Norton security do not play well together. After install it took 5 tries and 3 reboots to get it to connect to server and let me sign in. Then I noticed that Firefox would not work any longer as Norton changed some security setting upon install and blocked Firefox from connecting to internet. then I tried to update and that failed to install. then upon reboot i got stuck in a boot loop that kept telling my PC ran into a problem and after gathering info it would restart only to do it again over and over. I then managed to boot into safe mode and uninstall the program and presto everything worked fine again. So in short not very friendly program and unless your really willing to jump a lot of hoops to get it to work for you go for it or hey maybe you will hit luck and everything will run smoothly.
0,"Ordered this latest Quicken, by download instead of a disk, which was non-refundable.  I got it for use as a bank checkbook and to date have been unable to find the checkbook part.  My advice is to always get a disk, not just a download."
1,"I have used QB Pro to run a company with a 2 million pounds turnover in the UK, and so had no hesitation in purchasing it to use here in the US for a small business.  Love it!"
0,Did not work.
1,I am running Windows 7 64 bit and Resume Maker Pro Version 16 is stable.<br />The price for the download and the product features are really good.
1,Excellent software!  I imagine their purchased software must be A-1.
0,"It is fabulous if you want a very comprehensive map program. I just wanted something simple to replace Streets and Maps.  This is too complicated to use.  I just need something simple, and this is not it."
1,as usual keeps my systems safe
1,"I am a film maker and media student and have been using Magix Movie Edit Pro since 2007. I have used software across all price levels and experience levels. Everything from Avid to Pinnacle, to Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premier, Vegas, and others that people have never heard of, and I must say that this software is my go-to package. If you take the time to play with it, you'll discover that it has virtually all the same abilities as software that costs 10 times as much, and can do it just as well. I just used this to edit AVCHD video for a short film for my senior film project, and it worked fantastic. If you want decent software legally without wanting to take out a loan, this will do just fine. This is the 4th version of Magix Movie Edit pro I've owned, and it has never done me wrong. This version is considerably faster than others in the past in terms of rendering. It's interface is quite similar to Final Cut X, for those of you familiar with working with it. Be sure to mind the default preferences on start-up, some features such as the separate audio tracks are turned off by default. Tons of file support."
1,"My husband inquired abut the best antivirus, and he was advise by the computer tech to get Avast, we did"
1,"I have used Avast Antivirus for a few years now. It has kept my computer free of virus and has warned me a few times regarding certain web sites. Since it is free the cost if super, but I must add some change recently happened and it appears it scans every document, software and web page every time one is opened. The scaning process does seem to be taking longer and slows getting things accomplished as quickly as before."
1,"To be honest, I only bought this version because I updated my computer - but I'm glad I did.  The program moves faster - much faster than the 2012 version I had, and it's much easier to use!"
1,"Does anyone know if I buy two product codes, it would give me two-year subscription?"
1,"I've been a free Avast user for years, Avast has never failed me. I use it on my Android phone as well"
0,"Want to file? that's a fee.  Want to do your state taxes? that's a fee.  Want to do your city taxes? that's a fee.  Want to e-file? that's a fee. Oh, and want to do your fiancée's taxes? well, that is also a fee."
1,couldn't ask for a better and easier way to do my taxes.
1,"good product, better on windows, only few technical issues to find right tools.<br />Similar to windows, but not the same."
1,"I love Avast, I've been using it for years. it's saved me a few times too. You can't beat Avast for a free Antivirus software."
0,"This is one of those items I had trouble activating. I am a avid Norton user on the families 6 laptops and 2 PC's.i never use any other security system. Never had trouble before. May be one of those times when I may have been connected to the wrong rep. Things happen. Anyway, Norton is Still the best."
1,I have never had a bit of trouble since I downloaded Avast. If I have a concern ...it is easy to navigate to scan and feel secure.
1,good
1,"This is a copy of the review I posted on the downloaded version, I was so pleased with the program and their support that I when I replied thanking  them about their program and service they asked me if I would comment about it on Amazon. The reason I bought it in the first place was the comments on Amazon:<br /><br />Over the years I have tried several recipe programs, but they always came up short with ease of use and support, in fact I think they went out of business. There was a chance to buy an earlier version of this program for a great price and after reading a LOT of reviews on Amazon, I decided to try one more recipe program and am I glad I did. It was a great program that only seems to keep getting better with free upgrades and then after a year of two they have a full upgrade that does cost more money. I was very happy with version 10, but then a few problems cropped up and I contacted customer service. They not only got back to me with answers, it was done within 24 hours. Very consise and easy to follow. When they offered the free upgrade to using their cloud and syncing to my iPad and iPhone I jumped on it. The computer I use for all on the recipes is at my office so I would need to print any recipes I wanted to cook at home, but I could not get it to work so back to customer service. We tried several ways to get it to work, but to no avail. At this point they said they were aware of some problems and they were working on it, but if it would make me happy they would offer the upgrade to the newest version for a special price. I thought their offer was more than fair and I jumped on it that day. Unfortunely, it did not work either and I contacted customer service again, they replied in a few hours with a few more questions which I answered and in another hour they send a VERY detailed message that again was easy to follow and now it works great. I could not be more pleased with this product and how my problems were quickly solved in a professional manner. If you need/want a recipe program this is it.<br /><br />John"
0,"Purchased ver 2015 as a fix for the train wreck POS ver 2014.  Didn't even get to install it before the first critical error, ver 2015 is NOT compatible with Win XP and you can't install it.  Of course I found this after searching through the joke Intuit calls a support page.  So I'm getting a refund and giving up on Quicken products and Inuit"
1,"I'm running Windows 7 and am a long time user of Norton 360, but this year I switched to Norton Security.  I went for the bundle that includes Norton Utilities.  It is slightly annoying that you have to download Norton Security from the Norton site and Norton Utilities from the Amazon site, but the downloads and installation went smoothly for me.  What was not so smooth was what happened the next day.  When I booted up, I noticed that the Norton icon was not showing in the tray.  I tried to open Norton Security from the start menu, but could not.  I searched for help on the Norton site and found they have a two step process to follow if the program won't start.  The first step is to uninstall and reinstall.  I tried this several times, but it didn't work for me, so I went to step 2.  Uninstall, download and run Norton Power Eraser, reinstall Security.  This did work.  Apparently the reason Security won't start is because the uninstall procedure left some fragments that prevented Security from starting.  Norton Power Eraser was able to remove the fragments."
1,"I have used McAfee Total Protection for a few years and ordered this latest download from Amazon since my present protection was about to expire.  It was easy to download. It took some time because it had to take off my older software to replace it with this updated version, so if you want to upgrade, just allow yourself some time to allow this process to take effect.  McAfee is easy to use when you want to scan for viruses, and it does automatic scans about every 10 days.  It has found some viruses in the past on my computer and has secured them so that they would not effect my computer.  The software also does automatic updates quite often.  So once this software is downloaded to your computer, your worries are null."
1,"I have very simple tax needs (a few w2's and that's about it).  for this, the $20 pkg was just fine.  I did not see the reason to pay $50 for the other tax pkg (of course you need state so that's 20 and 50 for the 2 brands).<br /><br />I don't choose to do the electronic thing, so I print to laser, mail and that always works.  no extra fees for that."
0,"We have used Quickbooks for our retail store since it came out, many years ago. It was great at first - easy to use, reasonably priced. But recently it has become difficult to like this software and Intuit itself. Each year they have a new, money-grabbing tactic; abandoning version support, forced, costly upgrades, charging per employee, limiting installs. Now, I am starting an additional business with only two employees. I have been researching using Quickbooks with Payroll, but after reading the reviews here and on the Costco website, I will not be purchasing it. I called Quickbooks directly to ask questions, but the hold time was endless and when I finally reached someone, their English was so poor it was difficult to ask questions and understand answers. I did, however, gather that it would be expensive for me to implement the software for my minimum needs. I suspect that both the on-line and physical versions with payroll include additional and hidden charges that would make using this prohibitively expensive for me, and it is clear the company is migrating to on-line only, so purchasing the physical software is likely to be a waste of money when they abandon that version. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INNOVATIVE INTUIT SOFTWARE COMPANY? I can recall years ago thinking I should invest in Intuit because their products and service were unique and superior to others, but obviously that is no longer true. I will be purchasing a competitor product. Sad."
1,Pretty great been using it for a while it is very clean and low profile.
1,No problems
0,"Are you using Windows 8.1, you better think think twice about Total Security.  They have an issue where it will take up 98% of your hard drive and a patch that I won't count on it till August or so.    I do apologize for the issues you are having with Kaspersky. This issue has been fixed, but the patch containing that patch has been pushed back and we do not have a date at this time, though we do expect it to be released in late June / early July. In the meantime, it is recommended to install the 2014 version of the software in order to run Kaspersky with all the components enabled. You can be confident you still have full protection with the 2014 version. In order to do this, please uninstall the 2015 software and then install the 2014. You can uninstall the 2015 normally through the Control Panel. Then, download the 2014 from here:  I received this response after contacting them with the issue about four times and they were having me do all sorts of things before telling me the problem."
0,"I have used both TurboTax and HRBlock Tax software since 2001.  TurboTax Deluxe at about $35 did everything for me last year, but now TTx has eliminated forms C&D from Deluxe forcing people to go to the Premier version.  I am a buy and hold investor with few traces each year, and I own very little real estate as a retiree.  Therefore, Premier is overkill for me--I may try HRBlock again, even though their software was a bit awkward to use.  I do not like doing my taxes online--I do not trust the Cloud services."
1,Turbotax is awesome and I have been using it for over 15 years. Very easy to use. Easy to import data from last year makes it easier to get the job done.
0,"I purchased this download product.  After downloading it, I tried to install Premier Elements.  When I was asked for the serial number, I copied and pasted the serial number that came with the download package which says should be used for installation.  The installation program said the serial number was invalid.  I retried several times and the program would not install.<br /><br />Next, I tried to install Photoshop Elements and got the exact same error.<br /><br />So, neither program will install."
1,Good
0,"Very easy to use, but I had to file in two states because of a work related move and it cost me an additional $42 for another state return. Plus to e-file those state returns was $40...not happy."
0,does not retain bank information so cannot download statement... previous years are better
1,"I've had this on my system for just over a month now, and so far I really like it.  After a few more months like this, I'd add the last star!<br /><br />I've always had Norton, but the price is ridiculous for what you get.  I decided to try Kaspersky based on other reviews, and I haven't been disappointed.  My system doesn't lag or run as slow as it did at times with Norton, and so far the protection seems as good or better (Norton let some malware get by once).<br /><br />As long as it remains a good buy, I'll continue with this."
1,It has so many features including things like Registry cleanup and scan Facebook wall. Recommend it also for parents because it has parental control!
0,IRS yuck
0,"If there was minus stars I would give this a minus 100.............  I HATE this program.  I have had nothing but frustration.  I have been using Quicken since DOS times. 2012 was the last version and it was ok. NOW, My online downloads have either doubled or tripled when downloaded and messed up ALL of my accounts.  I will revert to Excel if I can't find something that is SIMPLE and easy to learn."
1,Great
1,Avast saved me from a very nasty virus.  I would recommend it to anyone as a good antivirus software product
1,I prefer the online version.
0,"I was very dissapointed with this product.  It either didn't have as many features as advertised or they were only available via an \\""upgrade\\"" of sorts (however, they were advertised as being available in this tool, perhaps just too complex to identify the features).  I re-read the instructions multiple times and still could not locate several key features.  I was using the software to re-design my kitchen, and maybe this isn't the best use for this product.  It had limited cabinetry options and the pieces didn't \\""snap to grid\\"" as I expected them to.  It took way too much time to line up the pieces and the 3D viewer was difficult to use.  Bottom line, it was just easier to draw what I wanted by hand than to learn to use this tool.  I wouldn't recommend this product for a kitchen re-design unless you have significant time to devote to learning to use the tool and can't draw to scale on regular graph paper.  I had hoped to use this to get 3D views of my ideas, but found the cabinet company (and Lowes) will do that for free anyway."
1,I don't need anything crazy or complicated. I just wanted to upgrade to Mountain Lion and that required an upgrade to my version of Quickbooks.
0,"This is SO BAD, don't waste your money.  The Mac version is very different than the PC version."
1,Best software for doing your own Taxes.  Have used for many years. Amazon always is the best price and easy shipping.
1,I did the download and got the program nearly instantly.  Also used part of my refund to get an Amazon gift card with a ten percent bonus.  Very happy with the whole experience.
0,"I just purchased 2014 Deluxe with the understanding that I would be automatically upgraded to Premium so I could enter my 1099B data - well that did not happened - I am now being asked to pay an additional $30 for premium. I have been using Turbo Tax for 10 years and the 2014 program used my 2013 data to fill out the 2014 form - including information on my stocks. I even re-downloaded the program after I got to the 1099B portion and repaired the program. To no avail - still being asked to purchase. What is going on? Am I missing something, or was all of this upgrade thing just a continuation of the pack of lies? - Not Happy  Instant Order Update for DAVE CLARK. You purchased this item on March 15, 2015. View this order. Platform: PC Download"
0,I bought it and installed it on about 10 computers in the office. It seems to work OK but a window keeps popping up on all of them asking me to log in and create an account. I don't want an account and I don't want to log in to anything. Antivirus software should work in the background completely unnoticed. I will be choosing a different product when this one expires.
1,"If you want to get into manipulating your digital images, this is the BEST software. It is build in three tiers ranging from super easy to a more powerful custom tools options. Good place to go if you want more control over your image quality and note be overwhelmed by PhotoShop CS6."
0,When converting pdfs to excel it doesn't give you the same flexibility as an older version I've  used.
1,Works similar to the older versions but the menu interface has changed over the years.  It works but the display is different than some of the earlier versions.  But of course it is a matter of getting use to the new interface.  That will come in time.
1,good deal no probs
0,"This is the demolition derby of business accounting software. All it does is crash and then it freezes the system.  Had been happy with my Quickbooks 2005, but the 2010 is an unmitigated disaster. One star is too high because this is worse than not working, it requires rebooting the system on a regular basis.      To make matters worse, the \\""help\\"" desk was worthless."
0,"I have used SONY Vegas 7,AVID and Adobe Premiere. I have the Movavi deluxe edition. The first thing I noticed about this software is that if you are you are using double system recording you cannot sync your audio to your footage. 2nd thing when you burn your DVD or BluRay it automatically adds contrast and saturation to your footage.that is not good. But if you have video and audio recorded together and don't care about controlling your image then this software is great. But for pro use--Forget it. This is software is more suited for consumer amateur use.  You are not going to get pro features out of any cheap software-"
1,"I was hesitant to buy one of these software tools as I had tried another tool several years ago and found it....frustrating.  Very, very frustrating.  What a difference from 10 years ago. I am mightily impressed by this tool!  I am designing a two-story addition for our home with lofted bedrooms and some architecturally interesting rooflines.  I was able to layout the existing home in about 40 minutes (I already had all the interior measurements) .  I was able to layout the addition in another 40 minutes (I already had basic floor plan  drawn up in Visio.  Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />* Basics are easy to learn.<br />* Space use layout let's you design by laying out the purpose of areas and then telling the application to build the rest.  WOW!!<br />* Online videos tutorials, and FAQs are REALLY helpful<br />* Custom Rooflines even artistic multi-sloped roof<br />* Adding and customizing doors, windows, and openings is very easy<br />* Customizing wall is very easy<br />* Auto rebuild feature reconstructs all or specific parts<br />* Can handle metal wall materials (studs, beams, etc)<br />* Placement of stairs is incredible (once you watch the video)<br />Cameras and views really allow you to see what you are building<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Every now and again it tries to &#34;help&#34; and it takes me a couple minutes to undo the &#34;help&#34;  - That is a small price to pay for the power of the tool and all the things it helps - right - with.<br />* No good HVAC ability - not really able to create a useful HVAC plan (you can use polygons but that is not really sufficient<br />* No good electric ability - Not able to create a useful electric plan<br />* No good plumbing plan - Not able to create a useful plumbing plan<br /><br />All in all it is a good powerful package and for the average DIY person, probably will exceed their wildest imagination  (I have a background in Computers, Drafting and the trades to give you an idea where I stand) I will draw the remaining plans using Visio or AutoCAD.  This got me 80% done in a couple hours.<br />I imagine that the more expensive Chief Architect software can create the missing plans (had I known I would have spent the extra $2K bucks - Chief Architect if you read this let me know)"
1,Never without it.
1,Had this version before. Was very satisfied. Did all that I expected. Would purchase again.
0,"I thought I could enter transactions on my ipad, but not. Also conversion lost some of my scheduled payments. Some of the usual features have changed negatively. Too showy and have to go to different screens to do some processes that were very simple in my old version. 2009 I think. I upgraded solely for the ipad functionality but didn't get it!!<br /><br />If you like what you got, wait and hopefully the next version will be a HUGE improvement!!  Wasted my money on this one. Maybe I will look into refund. Or a job helping them design a better system that the users (me) will like."
0,"Totally USELESS!  NO ONLINE BILL PAY!  I've been a loyal Quicken user for more than 15 years. I upgrade every year.  Always satisfied.  When I got a Mac, I wanted to move everything off my PC.  I used the conversion utility which worked just fine.  I realized this was much more primitive than the Windows version, but hey, I don't use a lot of the extra features anyway.  So all looked good until I wanted to send a payment.  WHAT??? Can't be done????  Surely I must be missing something.  But no, you CAN'T use online bill payment!  What a useless piece of software.  Anyone else remember the old pre-internet Quicken days where you had to feed the checks through a printer?  Stamps anyone???<br /><br />I need to keep my Windows PC or find some funky run Windows from Mac utility for just this one application.  Intuit - you should be ashamed."
1,I have used this product for the better part of eight years and continue returning because it runs in the background is easily programed and is not a sistem hog as others I have tried in the pst. a good antivirus for those who prefer these features in a computer antivirus program.
1,I really did a lot of research before purchasing trend micro titanium Internet security package. I will admit that there are so many different types of anti-virus software's that it is a little bit difficult to choose from so many different brands of product.<br /><br /> I have one PC and one notebook that have been operating flawlessly with no viruses. It's trouble-free and it runs in the background does automatic updates.  once it is installed and you have registered the product it is absolutely pain-free.  I like the fact that it does the automatic updates and really is an easy software to use.<br /><br /> I would gladly recommend Trend Micro Titanium.  Thank you for taking a moment to read my review.
1,Made life much easier for me.
1,Imported all my bank stuff pretty easily. Not so easy getting my 401k info into the program. The main reason I got this is to track my spending. I think I may be spending way to much on Games:)
0,"Is TurboTax kidding!  $74.99 to do my rental property, which I was able to do with Turbotax Deluxe at for $29.99.  I am switching to HR Block.  I hope the TurboTax Executives take notice.  You have lost a loyal customer of 15 years."
1,Best Product
1,I am a starting business owner(mechanic) and this tool is invaluable for todays modern market and smart phone applications where all my clients use smart phones and I can send their invoices and receipts to them digitally and be done. I love this tool
0,"I was nervous about buying this software because there were no reviews, and well, I made a poor decision! It looked like the software I was looking for, easy to use, simple, and the ability to adjust audio. I have used the iMovie software before and loved the easy of use and the ability to trim clips and adjust audio easily. This software was not easy to use and the audio was completely off without the ability to be changed. Not happy with this purchase at all!"
0,I CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK FOR ME.  I HAD AN OLD VERSION AND IT WORKED. VERY DISGUSTED WITH IT
0,"You cannot use this edition if you already have the deluxe.  It will not import your data and by that I simply mean your basic check book data, that includes spending and income. I wasn't looking to import anything else but it refused and informed that my data that I have had for 15 will be erased. I think that is pretty bogus. FYI, if you buy a digital download, you cannot return it, even if it is less than 10 minutes. I wish there was a way they could revoke my liscense and simply let me upgrade"
0,"no telling what changes intuit will make for turbotax next year so, i have decided to switch to h-r block and not deal with their greed this year forward."
1,Downloaded this directly to my computer.  Worked great when installed and no problem at all.  I would recommend this and would buy software this way again.
0,"Like many, I updated to Quicken 2013 because I had to in order to continue with on-line updates. I waited until the end of June 2013 to upgrade, thinking that most of the issues were solved. Wrong! Now, on my reports, THERE ARE NO BLOCKS THERE FOR ME TO CHECK ON THE ACCOUNTS TAB for me to select which accounts I want to use for my reports!!!! I can select Categories, Payees and Tags, but not accounts.<br /><br />I went to the chat line, and the guy trying to help me had no clue. I even sent him a screen capture to show what my problem was. He recommended a reinstall, which I did, to no avail.<br /><br />IS ANYBODY ELSE HAVING A PROBLEM LIKE THIS WITH THEIR PROGRAM? Maybe I got a corrupted version, but I got it from Amazon.<br /><br />Doug"
0,"Horrible , it locked my Imac and my Macbookpro , could not access any site not even Apple.com<br />Since it was downloaded had to trash it"
0,I only have 1 rental property so not sure it's worth the hassle nor investment.  Does keep good track and downloads easily.. Overall for the money i'm satisfied
0,"Symantec owns and operates Norton antivirus.  I have had Norton for years on my computer and have usually been satisfied with the software.  I have written a number of complaints to Symantec about the poor customer service.  I recently called Customer Service and the technician took control of my computer and worked on it for a brief time.  She ran into problems and simply logged off, leaving all the Microsoft Office software on the computer completely dysfunctional. No one called me back to explain what had happened and how I could make my computer operative again.  I was unable to get hold of anyone at Norton or Symantec Headquarters to help me quickly repair the computer and ended up driving 30 miles to have a technician repair it.  The follow-up to my strong letter of complaint to Symantec was disgraceful.  The guy wanted to lecture me on how &#34;Save Mode&#34; operates and other nonsense.  No compensation offered other than to &#34;take it under advisement&#34; if I send in documents.  EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I USED TO RECOMMEND NORTON TO FRIENDS BUT I NO LONGER DO SO!  THEY WILL DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY!"
0,"I've used TurboTax before and all was well.  This year, I worked on my taxes over several days, saving the files as I went.  Hooray, I  completed all the forms.  I went in after a couple of days to review everything and the ENTIRE file was wiped out!  I could see if it reverted to my last saved version, but to have lost the entire worksheet???  The program insisted I had nothing on file and wanted to start all over again.  While this was not the end of the world, it was distressful.  I called TurboTax support (which in and of itself was an adventure 5 calls and two days later I finally spoke with a live person) and all I got was &#34;well, looks like you'll have to do them all over again.&#34;  I will never use this again so this problem never happens to me again!  Thanks a lot TurboTax!"
1,"Easy to download. Easy to use. Had Norton 360 before and was easy to use, and most important, provided great virus protection."
1,"easy to use, half hour sessions are handy, adult oriented,  good for brushing up on formal language classes in the past"
0,Works - but annoying popup to upgrade.  OK after I disabled it.  The reason for the low rating is that the upgrade is overpriced in my opinion - $30 for a single purpose app.
1,I have used it on 4 computers for the last 4 years. It has been good to me. We use it at work as well.
1,I replaced an earlier version of Quicken with 2015 version. I am very pleased with the 2015 deluxe version it was easy to setup manualy as I did not wish to link it to my bank or use the data from the earier version.
0,"I am scared to even try this.  I've been working to try to update my subscription for nearly 3 hours now - website isn't helpful at all and customer service phone number say &#34;enter 5 digit extension number&#34; then hangs up!  I try to update payment info, says I can't do that until I update payroll info, which it won't let me do!  Urg!!!  How extremely frustrating...."
1,Love it!
0,"I am also a 15+ TuroTax user.  Intuit has come so far to lose so many loyal users with this years several great management blunders.  What with the recent data loss - tax refund abuse fraud, and Intuit's war on its long loyal customers, I am thinking about making the shift to get help from a tax (CPA) accountant this year.  A anticipate that doing so will make leaving Intuit a pleasure, that may stick on me.  Adding to the major issues that most of us have, I am also a swing option trader.  As far as I know, TurboTax still does not provide any way to automate option trading data into any of its software cost levels.  Regrets, and wishes for a satisfactory tax filing to all."
0,"I've been using Quicken since the dark, primitive DOS era. Over that time, the worst iteration I came across was Quicken 2013. I had to rebuild my data over from scratch. I got 2014 hoping it would be less buggy, a little faster and a little easier to find things than 2013. And it is. Just not by very much. I'm not sorry I got the updated version, but I feel it's more like 2013.5 than actual new version."
1,Excellent product.  Excellent accuracy with Viox Parrot Bluetooth wireless headset.  Thank you Nuance.  Do wish it worked more consistently with Google search engine.
1,"These flashcards are wonderful. I use them as part of my Step 1 study plan. They are accurate, quick to access, easy to use and allow me to study 'on the go'. They are great when I only have a quick 10-15 minutes to study!! I highly recommend them."
0,"Unfortunately this product does not have all the regular functionality of the PC version.  Since I ordered the item through Amazon, I can't return or exchange the software with Microsoft and Amazon will not return or exchange either.  I will be stuck with this version and need to potentially purchase the PC version as well.  If you need full functionality I would recommend buying the PC version."
0,"I am very disappointed in this product.  I couldn't get it to work on my computer.  I went to their FAQ and troubleshooting page, and discovered that you can only run this product with one monitor!  This didn't seem right at all so I wrote to their technical support via email and this was their reply:<br /><br />  Thank you for contacting Corel Customer Support.<br /><br />  Yes, You will need to use only one monitor, In order for WinDVD to play correctly, you need to use a single output, which we  recommend be your main desktop or laptop display, or change the way in which your display is connected.<br /><br />  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions.<br /><br />  Regards,<br />  Inocencio<br />  Corel Customer Support Services<br /><br />Normally Amazon doesn't perform refunds on Direct Download software products like this, but when I shared them this email, they provided a refund.  Thank you Amazon.  Buyer Beware."
1,Excellent product...very easy to use.  Highly recommend it.
1,easy to download or update norton
1,"The key for the product after installation was out of date, I contacted Amazon who asked me to contact AVG USA, they provided me with a new key. The program runs perfect, Does not consume a ton of RAM memory like other Antivirus."
1,I love Kaspersky.  I never have to worry about getting a virus on my computer.  I recently got a new pc and it came with another well known virus software...needless to say...I got a virus within a day.  I immediately purchased Kaspersky and installed it and cleaned out my computer.  It runs smoothly in the background and doesn't cause my computer to lag at all.
1,"It's simple to use but there is no manual and I had to go to the internet to get this very basic instruction. My goal was to convert my documents from WordPerfect (there's no  easy way to do that and maintain formatting). So, I converted the docs to pdf and then used this program to convert them to Word.<br /><br />To convert pdf to Word, right click on the document you want to alter, select &#34;Open With&#34; then select &#34;Fusion&#34;, then go to &#34;File&#34; and select &#34;save as&#34;, choose DOC and then save the document. Afterward the new Word document shows up in the same folder from which you got the original pdf. Formatting is very well maintained including footnotes and header/footers. This is the best software I have found."
1,"Fast, easy, great program"
0,"I have never used turbo tax but for the last two years I have been emailed someone else's completed return.  Have tried to contact turbo tax to no avail. To contact them I must open an account which I will not do for security reasons.  I would be reluctant to use the product, who know's who will get your return? Today 4/17/13 received a bill for their product that I have never purchased.  Spent an hour on the phone and might have resolved the problem.  Buyer beware of this product."
1,"I recomend this products, I did some projects with them, I´m realy impresed with the results. Good for rockies and professional designers."
1,"Great product, it handles all of our tax needs. I would highly recommend for returns that are not very complicated."
1,Great product. Easy to use. Use it every year.
1,"Update: I've been using the software for several months, and just prepped my 2013 data for my tax preparer.<br /><br />I'm liking this software more and more.  It's taking some getting used to after spending 15+ years on quicken.  But I'm getting there.<br /><br />The tax prep is fairly straightforward and it's going well.<br /><br />Note that there were a lot of bugs corrected with the release of the 5.1 beta, which came out a few days ago as of this writing (2/8/14).<br /><br />In short, I've committed.  I've abandoned quicken 2007 and am now exclusively using iBank 5, and despite a learning curve I'm very happy with my decision.<br /><br />I'd honestly give it 4.5 stars, so I had to choose between 4 or 5 here on Amazon.  I'm going with 5 not because it fully deserves it -- 4.5 is more accurate -- but because as a convert who is surprisingly pleased with the software, I want other Mac users to take a look and give it a real chance.  My previous review was 3-stars, so if you are on the fence, you have a month to try it out for free.  Again, it's not perfection, but it's the best Mac financial software I've found and I'm very happy with my switch.<br /><br />everything below this line is my initial review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />I am vacillating between continuing to use Quicken 2007 (I'm on a 2013 iMac running Mavericks OS), and switching to iBank 5 for some modern features and better Mac support.<br /><br />So far, I've transferred my account info over, with mixed results.<br /><br />Basically I exported my quicken data as a .qif file.  Ibank read it and created new accounts, and setting up online access was fairly painless.  Be aware that there's the free version, and the version that bank charges a monthly fee for, which is a far superior version. So your $60 ain't it, if you want read online access downloading to your data file, you'll be shelling out a few bucks extra each month.  (** Edit for clarity -- after you purchase thesoftware, there's a free version called Direct Download which uses OFX. Or there's IGG's \\""direct access\\"" which is a more advanced version, but which requires a monthly subscription after you've already paid for the software. Just something for you to keep in mind.)<br /><br />Now, there are some issues.<br /><br />First, I found a fairly comprehensive review site that covers Mac finance software.<br /><br />[note -- amazon won't allow this link here. You'll have to search for it yourself, sorry.]<br /><br />iBank is very absent from the review. From what I can tell, Moneydance is hosting this site and wants to be the top rated software, and likely rigged it. So if iBank scored higher than moneydance.... well, they just got rid of the competition.  So that's a good sign for ibank.  But I did download the demo for money dance as well.<br /><br />Moneydance imported my accounts as easily as ibank did... but it kept the reconciled account info from quicken.<br /><br />iBank? Nope.  Years of reconciled data.... gone.  Nothing was reconciled anymore.<br /><br />Igg tech support was responsive, but when they said, \\""When importing data from Quicken reconciliations are not imported through the QIF file....\\"" I found that hard to believe because somehow their competition managed to handle the previous reconciliations correctly.<br /><br />IGG did give me a fairly simple workaround, but I'd rather not need a workaround when there's clearly a better solution.<br /><br />Once you're in, expect many user interface.... well, screw ups.  These are basic, BASIC features that should have been around in version 1, certainly standard by version 5.<br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />Try reconciling an account.  Make a mistake and want to start over? Guess what.  You have to manually uncheck every single box. There's no \\""uncheck all\\"" option. Old Quicken 2007 has this, modern ibank does not.<br /><br />Now reconcile a credit card.  Quicken asks you for credit card balance, you put it in.Ibank asks for credit card balance, you have to put it in parenthesis.  Because it's money you owe, and that's how they write negative balance.<br /><br />That's right. It looks like this.<br />Credit card balance:<br />quicken: $1,500.00<br />Ibank: (1,500.00)<br /><br />Again, it's technically correct that you owe that money, but that's a hassle for the end user to have to enter.  And there's no obvious instructions to do so, which means my reconciliations were all wrong until tech support told me how their software needs it entered.<br /><br />This is idiotic.  I want the software to work for me, not make me figure out the software.  Again, quicken 2007 does it just fine, so we know it can be done.  No excuses as to \\""it's not doable\\"" are allowed.<br /><br />Now go to your bank account.  Try to enter a new line.  Say you wrote a check.<br /><br />Quicken 2007? Ready to go.  iBank? First.... you have to press the + button to create a new entry.  What?!  New blank lines should be automatically waiting for me, don't make me do a single unnecessary action, that's bad interface design.  But wait, it gets worse.<br /><br />In quicken 2007, you want to change the transaction date by a day or two?  Pressing the + or - sign cycles through next or previous days.  Heck, you don't even have to press shift and equals.... just hitting the equal sign, which shares the key with the plus sign, moves to the next day.  Because it's a well thought out interface!<br /><br />Then in quicken, tab over to name entry, then to the withdrawal cell.  If you put a numerical value in there, the next tab skips deposit entirely -- because one line can only be a withdrawal OR deposit -- and moves to the next cell.<br /><br />Nope.  Ibank -- be prepared to enter the full date every time (unless it's TODAY), and the tab moves through every single cell, even if you can't use it.<br /><br />If I were a professor, I'd give the student who turned that in a C.  The fact that it's the 5th version of the software and none of these gaffes have been corrected means they aren't remotely paying attention to what you, the user, wants in financial software.<br /><br />I'm currently leaning towards letting the trial expire and going back to dusty -- but working -- quicken 2007.  iBank -- I am so ready to hand you my money and leave intuit behind, but you gotta get your act together and get a real user interface down first.<br /><br />(Note that even the behemoth Intuit realized quicken 2007 was so good, they updated it to work on modern operating systems because they listened to their customers!  I'm waiting for IGG software to catch on to the listening to customers approach.)"
0,This program has not been helpful. Program defaults to sales pitch ad and this was not fixed by phone contact with Rosetta Stone. This may be a fault of download format but so far the learning program has been unsatisfactory.
1,"Great program, love the new tools and cloud drive storage. Great app for android. New tools and reports. Been using Quicken since 1998 and it keeps getting better."
1,I have used this software for over 10 years and love it.  Have NEVER found it as low-priced as downloading it from Amazon's site.  What a great deal!!
1,Best antivirus. Download was fast and installation smooth.
1,"It installs quickly and works well.  My laptop crashed and hanged a lot after installation.  Dont know if its coincidence or not but I reinstalled Norton and no problems so far.  I know there are a lot of other antivirus softwares out there today which are better like AVG, AVAST or Kapersky but I still end up with Norton............wonder why ?"
1,"If you are simply interested in managing your everyday checking, savings, credit, and investment accounts, it works very nicely.  It is a lot easier to use than the old Mac version.  I think they were right to toss the old version and start with something much more Mac friendly.  I particularly like the new Category Explorer - very easy to poke around and see where your money is going.  And the transaction downloads from banks are pretty reliable.  I only have one, an equity line, that doesn't work.  I am no Intuit fan and was quite nervous about the switch, but was pleasantly surprised."
1,"I was using Quicken 2007 and was very comfortable with it.  I upgraded to Yosemite and Quicken 2015.  I was initially discouraged because the interface was different.  But I pushed on and figured it out more quickly than I thought I would.  Now that I'm a little more familiar with it, I like it even better than the 2007 version"
1,Makes tax season a breeze.
0,"Quicken forces an upgrade every three years to continue online services (financial institution downloads).  I was running Quicken 2011 so went ahead and &#34;upgraded&#34; to 2014.  2014 installed and converted my data file without any error messages (I had turned off virus detection during the install).  But 2014 crashes each time I attempt to open my checking account tab.  Went to the support site and downloaded all patches but no joy.  I reverted to 2011 to record current transactions, but I am VERY disappointed.  I can't believe Intuit is still actively marketing a known defective product!"
1,Very good
0,"Buy the product, Take the money right away, send the link and no codes to put in to down load the product. Really?? Also running circles to get a hold of Amazon to fix the problem  Your customer service is VERY BAD. I do not recommend buying a down load from Amozon,"
1,"Have used avast for the past 2 years, it works great even for a free version. You get updates and everytime your computer/laptop/tablet and even mobile startup the program does a virus scan. You can even initiate scan on your own time. And when it successful blocks a virus, nothing gives you a sense of satisfaction as that, virus detected, virus blocked alert. Would and have recommended all versions to others"
1,"I wanted an application to manipulate PDF files - - comprehensively and this one does! I had tried \\""freebees\\"" that often disappointed me. I decided to make a financial investment in a program that was about PDF files from the \\""ground up\\"". Whenever I need it, though I don't use it often, it does what I want with ease!"
0,"I like this, but I think GUI is so simple. That's it."
1,Does everything that I need it to do and doesn't slow my computer down. I experimented with a few other brands over the years and always had issues. Not anymore.
1,Overall it is fine and very similar to previous versions. There is one thing that is missed from previous versions. Transfers now require using a drop down to access where before it was an icon that could be clicked. Maybe I am the only one that routinely transfers funds between accounts but I miss the easy access to transfers.
0,"Said it works on mac, total lie. Will not return purchase, even though never open download. Tried to cancel order within minutes of placing order."
0,"Same old Norton's, difficult to install and update.  Does NOT work well with Windows 8.  Support... well, I could not tell as I never received a reply after the &#34;I am connecting you to the best tech for the problem you described.. please wait&#34;  nothing after 30 minutes.<br /><br />I stopped using Norton products for this very reason in the 1990's and wish I had not made the mistake this time..."
0,"This is a good product but it kept freezing my computer.  I liked everything it said it would do, just don;t feel I need to purchase new antivirus software to be able to use this product. Good product, just did not work for me."
0,"Had to purchase Premier instead of the Deluxe I've used for decades, but even it no longer has Schedule C forms.  AND the &#34;upgrade link&#34; to Home & Business (even more expensive) does not work.  After two hours on hold with Intuit, still no service. Hard to screw this up any worse, Intuit!!  H&R is laughing."
1,"Great product , works as described"
0,nothing to write home about
1,"I have been using Movavi Video Suite for over a year now , and I find it a wonderful performing program.  It is relatively easy to use, almost intuitive.  I have also picked up on their Photo Suite program to handle all my photo editing needs.  I have been through quite a few programs in the past 4 or 5 years, but I am really liking the programs these folks produce.  I stumbled upon them by accident, but I will use these for a lifetime!!"
1,I was able to upload my info from last year's return even though I used different software. Easy to use and seemed very thorough. I used this version because I rent out my former home. Not giving it 5 stars because $20 to file state electronically. I know this is a standard price but I don't have to like it.
1,Its a great piece of FREE software that gets the job done.  I recommend this product for those who have a low cost budget and require excellent security.
1,Great program - I highly recommend it
1,"Any time there is a new version, there is a bit of a learning curve, but has been reasonable easy to adapt to this version.  Am eager to see how the ability to sync with the mobile app works.  That could come in very handy!"
1,I switched from turbo tax to H&R Block software a few years ago and appreciate the value on this years purchase from Amazon
0,"We run Quicken inside a Windows VM on a Mac because the Windows product is so much better than the Mac product.  Since we were running Quicken 2010 and it was EOL in April of 2013, I started shopping around for a replacement.  I'd love to run a Mac native product and stop using a VM for our financial management, but the CFO of my house evaluated half a dozen programs and said she still wanted Quicken for Windows.  So I bought the Quicken 2013 Windows download and installed it, only to find out I couldn't open our old Quicken file.  Here's what I wish I had known before installing:<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE PASSWORD-PROTECTED YOUR QUICKEN 2010 FILE, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE PASSWORD BEFORE UPGRADING, OR QUICKEN 2013 WON'T OPEN THE FILE!!<br /><br />I don't know how to write that more boldly.  I wasted hours online, with tech support and my own web research before determining I had to:<br /><br />1. Uninstall Quicken 2013<br />2. Spend an hour trying to locate the Quicken 2010 installation CD that I hadn't needed or seen for 3 years<br />3. Re-install Quicken 2010<br />4. Remove the password from the file<br />5. Install Quicken 2013<br />6. Manually download and install the latest upgrade patch for 2013 since auto-download failed<br />6. Apply the password back to the file<br /><br />Apparently somewhere between 2010 and 2013, Quicken changed the encryption method on their files.  They can afford to put their name on an NBA stadium, but they apparently can't hire enough software engineers to make a decent upgrade experience.  And all this so we can continue to do the exact same thing we were already doing, but with more bloated software.<br /><br />I sorely wish there were a decent, Mac-native competitor to Quicken so we could get off the carousel of forced upgrades and bad software.  Maybe within the next 3 years, one of the competing products will mature enough for us to switch."
1,One of my instructors put a link up to the free trial. After using the free trial I loved it. It is really helping with my classes.
0,"this is my last year using Turbo tax. Removal of schedule D without any warnings or labeling to alert you to that fact and then all the dire in program warnings that you must upgrade to premier because your taxes will be incomplete is purely designed to scare you into upgrading when the Schedule D is still available from the &#34;forms&#34; screen. (no you won't get the step by step hand holding, and efiling is not permitted?).<br /><br />Offering the $25 rebate for people who upgrade to premier still results in an additional $20 charge for the upgrade.<br /><br />Next year I'm hopping off the turbo tax bad wagon and using something else."
1,"Avast! Antivirus is non-invasive and uses the least memory to protect my system.  I have 2 towers, 1 laptop, a Nexus 4, and a Nexus 7; all of them has Avast! Antivirus."
1,"I have been a Turbo Tax user up until this year when I switched over to H&R Block.  It is obviously too early to give a complete rating, but I did want to let potential users know that there is no problem importing data from Turbo Tax as one user has led us to believe.  Why that review was listed as the most helpful critical review is beyond my understanding.  That user obviously was in error and probably works for Turbo Tax and is trying to spread false information.  I imported data for two returns and verified the information seemed to be correct.<br /><br />I will provide more information on this product later in the tax season.  Do not be afraid to buy this product just because someone is giving out false information with regards to importing data from Turbo Tax."
1,It works very well and am very happy with it.
1,I wanted to update my 2005 version.  I found this deal and couldn't pass it up!  Thank you so much Amazon.com!
1,This program offers protection which is second to none. I have used avast for several years now and I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend it!
1,One of the best text programs I've ever used great job fellows
1,"Comipo was very good! I liked it because it was really easy to use, and there was a lot of wide varieties of possibilities to it. The objects and facial features were pre- set, which made the application very fun and creative."
1,"This is possibly the 15th year I have used Turbo Tax.  I find it easy to do the &#34;step by step&#34; method, answer the questions, and get the work done.  I usually do mine and my mothers and both are easy.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was that this time, when I printed out my return, I felt there was a form missing and I could NOT get it to print.  It was a form about my automobile usage, and I use two in my small business.  It only printed one.  If you've never used Turbo Tax, try it.  It cost less than a trip to H&R Block and it's really very easy."
1,This is the 3rd year in a row I have used this program.  Very user friendly. I highly recommend it.
0,Only a trial
1,I am in the IT field and I have been using the Free version of Avast on my home pcs for a number of years.  I have seen Avast stop an attempted infection from simply going to an infected website more than once.  I have never been infected from malware.  I have experience on more readily recognized AV programs  here in the US on customers' workstations and in the company I work for and haven't experienced from them the same level of protection AVAST is giving me on my home pcs.  I recommend AVAST to everyone I know.
1,I have used this program for years. Never let me down. Very quick and easy restoration. Great support. Extremely recommend.
0,"First, I did not \\""purchase\\"" this software by choice.  Rather, I was FORCED to get it after my 60 Day Office 2010 Trial Ended.  I happily clicked on purchase the product not realizing at the time that I would be getting Office 2013.  Well, three calls to customer service later and some strong words finally convinced them that I deserve a refund.  Not only did it take FOREVER to download, but every time I shut my computer down, the program would stop working!  I would have to call customer service, endure a ridiculously long LogMeIn rescue session only to have them re-install the application.  HELLO!!! I should not have to re-install Office every time I restart my computer.<br /><br />The licensing issue just adds insult to injury.  Finally, though some may find it hard to believe, there are still folks in the world like me who DON'T want cloud based applications.  When I had to choose between a tablet or a laptop, I CHOSE  A LAPTOP!  I'm just a traveling business person who does not need the bells and whistles, and I prefer external storage... No apps, no frills, so the whole cloud based nonsense is worthless to me.<br /><br />I can't begin to innumerate how disappointed and frustrated I am with this horrible product.  To make matters worse, trying to find Office 2010 is a nightmare (Microsoft told me they don't offer it anymore!!).  I will find it somewhere.<br /><br />BAD MOVE MICROSOFT!!!!"
1,It's a great replacement for Microsoft Office. It's helped me a lot in projects for school and personal use.
0,"I buyed the software microsoft outlook 2010, but I can´t download the program, an error appears.  Please help me with this problem. I live in Costa Rica."
0,Accountant 2015 does not work as well as 2014 and continues Intuit's practice of making the program  &#34;fancier&#34; and less functional.  The problem that the program has in accessing files from a shared drive makes it all but useless for a networked environment.<br /><br />If I had to guess they are making the program less user friendly to push people to their inferior but more expensive online platform.  Intuit is a very big company but it would be nice if they tried to be a good one as well.
0,"Very quirky software.  I experienced installation failure problems and had to call and e-mail tech support. Never got a response back and after being on hold for 2.5 hours, I concluded that their technical support was a joke!!  End result, I did not trust the accuracy and calculations of the program. It seemed to skip and not properly address key tax or deduction components. I ended up switching to Turbo tax and taking advantage of all the entitled deductions. Amazingly different end results."
0,"The TurboTax software is fine.  It's great, as a matter of fact.  Amazon's delivery of the software was less than stellar, however.  My first issue is I wasn't given the opportunity to use my credit card rewards to pay for it.  I have the rewards account linked to my Amazon acct.  Nowhere in the purchase process did it allow me to specify to pay for it with the CC rewards.  The second issue was that the software download was not immediately available.  I had to wait for an email saying the software was available to download.  When the software was available, the amazon downloader crashed twice before successfully running.<br /><br />After a couple of attempts I did get the software downloaded and installed.  It was more headache than I'm accustomed to with an Amazon purchase."
0,I've used Turbo Tax before. Easy to use.
0,Hard to use.  Not as user friendly as my first PrintMaster!
1,Excellent product which has detected many virus threats and blocked/removed the.  A GREAT product!
1,Use it for the first year I'm learning the product...
1,This is a very easy to use product and makes life much simpler.  Keeping the books was the most stressful part of my business.  Now I just enter the information on a daily basis and it keeps me up to date on everything.
0,"This program is not a true bookkeeping software; it does have financial reports that I'm used to. I'm having to go from Sage Peachtree because I can't afford their upgrade prices. As a certified professional bookkeeper I like printing a balance sheet & income statement which this program does not provide. However I love the fact I can download transactions from my bank which saves some time in the long run. I do not like all the personal stuff that's included in the software just makes reporting difficult but I did delete all those categories. I am disappointed in the fact I cannot add Capital or draw accounts as the equity accounts are not available. I am disappointed in the business profit & loss reports which allows you to include categories from the rental side, but alas they do not show up on the report. I had hope this would be the perfect replacement for Sage but it will have to do. We have three properties that I need to keep track of & this program will work for now just don't expect to get a true Financial Statement out of it."
1,I have used H and R Block tax software for many years and enjoy the format and ease of use.
1,I found this version to work fine for home use.  I do have some business expenses (very minimum) so I had to adapt it in some cases.  No big deal.
1,"Downloaded the Win version from Amazon on 12-10-14. I also have the 2013 Win version installed on my laptop from last year.    1. (On my laptop) I clicked install and a Window popped up with something like C:\Program Files\HRBlock 2013\setup\home&biz DL.EXE already exists. Overwrite file?  (if you don't have last years version installed it would just start installing what looks, to me, like the 2013 version.)    2. So I canceled install and called H&R Block, who sent me a direct link for the program. I downloaded and clicked install but got the same C:\Program Files\HRBlock 2013\setup\home&biz DL.EXE already exists.    3. I thought the 2014 version may need to install some 2013 files for importing last years data?    4. Moving to my desktop (which does not have H&R Block 2013 installed) and using the H&R Block download, I clicked install (a window popped up with the same 2013\setup dialog file to unzip but having nothing to overwrite proceeded to install.  I looked at a couple forms in the Premium part once the program was running and they are for the 2014 Tax year. (The desktop Icons are 2014 too.)    5. The program then installed the Business part. I checked some of the forms and they are for 2014 as well, although some are still in DRAFT.    6. (Back on my laptop) I then tried the Amazon Download, I clicked install (overwrote my 2013 files) and it installed the Premium and then the Business. Again I checked a couple forms once the programs were running and they are for the 2014 Tax year.    I don't know if that will be the case for anyone else, but it was my experience."
1,I've used Avast free antivirus for over 10 years and it works better than the paid ones I had tried before that.  It caught things that Norton and Mcafee didn't.  I don't use anything else.
1,"Best on the market -- easy to use and just delivers everything it promises. I'd recommend it to all who want a simple, powerful, antivirus program."
1,"This product superseded my expectations, with the extreme ease of use in my daily uses with PDF files..  The ease of (Creating, Modifications, Form Creations, Form Fills, Scanner direct to PDF, protection of your PDF personal files, and convertions from PDF-Office-PDF with extreme ease..  I am very happy with this amazing product..."
1,Excellent program and very easy to use.
0,"The user interface is not intuitive and is, in fact, very confusing. Even after using it for a few days I often couldn't do what I wanted to do without a lot of searching and false steps. I imported my accounts from Quicken for PC's and they did not import properly. For example I had almost 10 years of transactions given the same date. As a result it made it almost impossible to find a particular transaction. Plus there would be no way to generate a report based on dates. And when I added a new transaction I often couldn't find where it was in the list of transactions. As a result, I'm not going to be using this program and feel that my $ was wasted."
1,Great product. I would recommend.
1,You have to buy this security for your computer its so awesome.
0,"I have used TurboTax for the last several years, and each year, there is exactly one form that is keeping me from using a cheaper version of TurboTax.<br /><br />One year, it was having an HSA. I could have filed with TurboTax Basic except for needing a single form (8889) causing me to need Deluxe instead.<br /><br />The next year, it's a single stock sale causing me to need Premier instead of Deluxe. Is this by design?<br /><br />I think intuit needs a better business model. Perhaps allowing you to buy single form add-ons for $1-2 each, instead of one form being a $20-40 upgrade to the next TT tier. Or just having only two versions of TurboTax: Home (includes ALL non-business forms), and Business (includes everything else).<br /><br />Hopefully next year's TurboTax releases have a better strategy. If not, I will probably try out H&R Block's tax prep software."
1,"My second year with Webroot.  It has proven to be reliable, effective, and uses little resources. I have a hard time supporting the full retail cost but if you can get it for a sale price. Go for it!"
1,The only thing I found is it cannot resolve an issue when a state has had 2 different sales tax rates within one calendar year. I found a work around.  Their &#34;help&#34; forums are not helpful but the program works.
1,"Very cheap, very efficient program!"
1,"Is this product as good as Microsoft?  No, but hey it's free and does all the basics well. Must say it could be more user friendly. I'm still trying to figure out the nuances of the database program. Luckily it has a \\""wizard\\"" with templates that can help. But I'm still trying to figure out how to open an e-book I think I created using an extension.<br />Try it!  What can it hurt"
0,"I have always purchased Turbo Tax and have been well pleased. I decided to go with Amazon's better price. That was a mistake. It would not open far enough to do any good. I contacted TurboTax and they fixed it. I don't know what was done to fix, but why should I need to do this?!"
1,"I'd used MS Money for years and had to change to Quicken. I miss some of the features in Money that Quicken doesn't have, but it does the job once you get used to it."
0,"Since they are the only real option out there, what choice do we have. Microsoft Money had major issues and they finally gave up selling their product. Quicken has no real reason to innovate. They make changes here and there, but the product is really almost the same as the last two versions I have used. I upgraded because I needed to move from the Deluxe version to the Home and Small Business version. Otherwise I probably would have continued using Quicken Deluxe 2010. I do like the new mobile app they created. That is a real plus for the offering. I can't figure out why they are not offering a version specifically for the iPad or Android tablets. I would think they could at least create a good Deluxe version or a hosted version that is accessible from these platforms. So far I have had no major issues with the new 2013 version and am glad they have been pushing bug fixes quickly."
1,Incredibly easy to get and install. The protection is so complete I recommend it to everyone I know. I feel SECURE!
1,I have Avast! installed on of my family's computers. I've never had a problem with them and looking forward to installing it on my new computers. &#60;3
1,So far so good!
0,"I was using Quicken 6 and loved it.  When I went to Windows 7, Quicken 6 would not run so I had to upgrade which was not a problem.  What was a problem was that I could not get my data transferred from 6 to 14.  A Quicken rep tried for four hours by phone and on line and was unable t do it either.  I was going to load the data manually but found the new version difficult to understand but it may be because I am old.  I finally gave up and set up my accounts in Excel.  Quicken 14 is now just sitting on my computer taking up space and collecting dust."
0,"I prepare federal and state income tax returns for trusts which I manage.  For my personal income taxes, I use Turbo Tax Home & Business (4 Stars), which imports my Edward Jones 1099's just fine.  I thought I could save a lot of time preparing Form 1041's with Turbo Tax Business.  However, it does not support data import.  So, I have to create a fake return using Turbo Tax Home & Business, import the consolidated 1099's into that return, print the appropriate schedules and then type the information into the real trust income tax return.  Although easier than calculating and typing directly from the 1099's, inserting 60 plus transactions by hand is a real pain.  If Intuit does no include this next year, I will not be buying the program."
1,"I've used Print Master programs for years.  I do all my own design work because I enjoy it so much.  Again, Print Master hasn't let me down.  I was a little frustrated when I upgraded to windows 8 and it's incompatibility.  I would like to see more clipart/photos regarding alternative healing.  What do you think?"

0,Even with good products things do no always worked out as planned.  When that happens with Quicken get ready to start wasting your time to save theirs.  Their system is set up to making talking to a support member difficult. My average time after getting through the road blocks the establish to talk to someone is close to an hour. And if you need help on the weekend you are out of luck because they only make an atemp to be helpful on week days.Even on a chat line they say the average wait is 25 minutes. I believe they have a good product. If it only came with customer service that didn't suck<br />Don Buckroyd
0,I was checking prices and about to purchase when I saw the low rating. I decided to check out the reviews and am I glad I did. Thank you everyone. This customer is heeding your warnings and looking at an alternative brand.
1,"The best Antivirus 2014 so far and Secured for Internet Security, Easy to download and The price is reasonable. I like it :)"
1,"Very easy to use. I have a small number of stocks and Turbo Tax makes it very easy to put all the transactions into the correct entries. It is especially greats since all I have to do is select my online broker, enter some key information and TurboTax will import all this required information for me. This also works for W2 if your company uses a payroll company (most of the large ones do)<br /><br />Turbo Tax uses and 'interview' process asking the questions as you go through the different sections of filling out the Federal Tax forms. Saves a lot of time and, as noted previously, puts all the entries in the correct location and forms. I was able to complete my entire income tax session in a matter of a few hours.<br /><br />Online filing is very easy to use. A couple clicks and the filing is done. Afterwards I'll make a full backup copy of everything onto a CD, file it away with some hard copies.<br /><br />Making an addendum is also easy. I had to do this one year and took a short amount of time and was able to file online<br /><br />Have used Turbo Tax for 15 years and will continue to use them."
0,"We have been using TurboTax for many years with satisfaction. We are running Mac 10.6.8. What usually takes about an hour to file our taxes took more than 6 hours this time. So many glitches and problems. It seems this is common for 2012 taxes. I am curious if those 2 sentence reviews that say how easy it is to use are authentic. From our perspective, avoid at all costs if you are using a Mac and expect TurboTax to work as it has in the past."
0,Can't e-file keep telling me to update the software I did that 20 times and still won't let me validate and e-file. When it happen on the last hour of April 15 that's really piss me off.
1,"First time using this software. Did the job just fine. Good product, very user friendly, clear directions. Will buy again."
1,Comprehensive and professional results from this.
0,This is not working ..what do I do?
0,"Wow, just wow.  About five years ago I had an earlier version of Adobe Premiere Elements and produced some nice stuff with it.  I figured this would be an improvement and, I now that I have a faster machine, 8 GB RAM, Win7, Intel Core i7 processor, etc., I hoped to be able to do even more, and efficiently.<br /><br />This product never once did anything other than crash.  It's as though it's completely overwhelmed by video file sizes.  Now I'm not a novice computer guy - but I readily admit I'm no pro when it comes to editing.  But I have some experience and despite multiple re-installs, this thing is going in the trash."
1,Fine as usual.
1,Software works exactly as advertised and the download worked as well
0,"Quite frankly, I didn't want to upgrade to 2013, but the price of 2010 was far too high these days.  I don't like the 'updates' made to the user interface for 2013 and the severely limited color scheme options.  I don't like that I only had the option for 1PC/1User unless I chose the 365 version that binds me to a yearly subscription.  I miss Office 2010."
1,Get 7
1,Great help and teaching aid. Lots of fun. many different teaching levels available. A great time for the whole family

0,"I repeatedly have to kill Quickbooks 2013 because the window is at the top left of the screen and won't maximize. Still get errors about null handlers in the event log, that Intuit has not fixed in the 10 years I've used their product. Can't wait fot the QB killer to come along.."
0,Quality of the images is bad and program won't stay engaged for long.  Stops working and removes itself from my screen saver selection list. Useless.  Would like my money back!
0,"Elements of the main window did not operate intuitively, reminiscent of a poor java application. The hide form button hides all the corner tax help, which one wouldn't expect. There are no instructions to click the Show Form button to display the corner tax help. Help does not list many keyboard shortcuts.   That wasn't too bad, but when I reached Schedule M, I was presented with a blank screen above the form. No information, no explanation, no NEXT button. I tried hiding the Schedule M form, and then the hide form / show form button disappeared for that screen and could not be enabled again. I tried reinstalling, etc. I could not find a keyboard shortcut for showing the form again, either. In fact, the forms seem to be permanently hidden from the main window. I could find Schedule M via the Open Forms dialog, but I could not get any guidance for it."
1,GOOD PRODUCIT
1,"I've had the OTHER, very well-known, photo-editor program for quite a while.  I never liked it.  At one time, I also had Paint Shop Pro on my computer, but I wasn't able to transfer it when I got a new computer.  Fed up with wrestling with the big-name brand, I decided to break down and buy Corel's Paint Shop Pro again.  What a relief!  To me, PSP is so much more user-friendly.  And I love the fact that Corel goes out of its way to teach and guide you as you go along.  There's a panel that pops up whenever you open a tool, and it explains the basics of that tool.  Plus, they have an extensive collection of video tutorials, which Corel makes readily accessible.  One of the strange things about the &#34;big-name brand&#34; is that they seem to have no interest in helping you learn the program or trouble-shoot problems.  If you click &#34;Help,&#34; you just get directed to an online forum of users.  To me, every complex computer program (like a top-notch photo editor) has an obligation to put together a comprehensive User's Guide.  It's not enough to tell you to &#34;ask around&#34; to find the answer to your question.  I still lament that these programs don't come with a printed version of a User's Guide, but that seems to be a thing of the past."
0,"Throttles my machine constantly, consuming 100% CPU and more than a GIG of memory for no apparent reason. I shall be uninstalling it today. From Kaspersky tech support: &#34;This issue has been fixed, but the patch containing that patch has been pushed back and we do not have a date at this time, though we do expect it to be released in late June / early July.&#34; (Personal Email - 29 May 2015). As you can imagine, not being able to return defective software is less than optimal."
0,I bought wondershare online because I heard that this was a great software package to use. I put together slideshows for sporting events and weddings. It's very user  friendly to pull yo ur pictures up and put them all in a row but I am having a difficult times navigating through all the options of how to save a DVD to burn on CDs<br />I don't understand all the options yet and how to buen them. Overall. Its ok
0,"My comment to the Quicken problem report:<br />I've tried your cursed registration process about 7 times now, including a re-boot with all anti-virus and firewalls down.  I double checked my browser to make sure pop-ups were allowed and enabled malware and location tracking.  The software is at R12.  My next step is to see if Amazon will take it back!"
1,This is one of the best anti-virus products and has the particular virtue of consuming very little computer resources in comparison with other anti-virus products. I like it a lot!
0,"ordered the wrong program, I have a Mac."
1,Easy to use and install.  Great for our office upgrade.
1,I have used norton product since I was in my mother's womb. They work great. I have never used any other antivirus product. It is a good product.
0,"I'm a student heading off to college in about a week or so, and I've needed Microsoft Word because it's kind of the standard for transferring files in the education world.I have the Mac Works suite, which looks beautiful on my New MacBook Pro with Retina Display. But I've grown up on Microsoft Office and I wanted to go back to something I was familiar with.<br /><br />Now, let me get something straight-- I am happy I made this purchase. First of all, it's discounted quite a bit on Amazon.com. Also, its Microsoft Office, which is generally trust worthy (although there are apparently a few Excel problems).<br /><br />But with my MacBook Pro Retina Display, this software is capitol U-G-L-Y. Pixels clog the screen and actually cause eyestrain because its so blurry and low quality. It does the job you need it to do, but it doesn't look as clear and pretty as everything else on the computer. I mean, everything else. The Office Suite sticks out like a soar thumb.<br /><br />I know-- or at least, hope-- that this will be fixed in a future update. But until then, I'll probably stick to Pages and just convert those documents into Word docs."
1,"I purchased this product with three main goals: to stay fresh on my piano skills, to progress in a structured way, and to get instant feedback on my practice.  This product has succeeded at least two of those regards.  The progress goal remains to be seen; but, that is not the fault of the software, as I shall explain.<br /><br />I had just completed a semester of piano at my university; so, I do not approach the piano or music theory as a complete beginner.  I am presently beginning Chapter 3 of the software's instruction.  At this point, I will say that I am still learning some unfamiliar tidbits here and there.  More importantly, this software has greatly strengthened some of my week areas.  It has improved my sight reading, especially.<br /><br />The software has a fairly attractive interface and seems pretty responsive to my electronic keyboard.  I am connected by a MIDI-USB cable from the keyboard to my laptop.  I did note a few initial failures of the software to pickup on keystrokes early on; but, this wasn't noticed after the initial 'key finding' lessons.  To be fair, this could be the fault of the keyboard and not the software.<br /><br />I share in a previous reviewer's bafflement that instruction begins with black keys.  I get the feeling that this is not usual; but, it isn't a hindrance, really.  White keys were soon introduced thereafter.<br /><br />Based on what I've experienced, I have every intention of purchasing more advanced-level software from the same developer, after completing this.  It is very efficient practice and integrates ear training, sight reading, instant feedback, a huge assortment of helpful tools, logical structuring of the lessons, and good multimedia (videos and audio).  This is a small list of the good features.  Perhaps I should've started with a more advanced version of the software; but, it hasn't been a waste at all and I've filled-in some gaps."
0,"Betternet ofr Google Chrome works great. Betternet for Windows is terrible. It never connects. It just says connecting if you tell it to reconnect automatically. If not, it doesn't matter. You will never get a connection. Until it improves, do not waste your time with it."
1,Have used Turbo Tax for at least 15 years.  Excellent programming and visuals.  Can guide you through step by step - or lets me enter on my own.
1,"A little complicated for me, but exactly what I needed.  Very professional quality recordings.  I only use it for spoken word recordings, but I love having the ability to correct, cover and continue without any fuss.  The editing and mastering tools are great.  Glad I got it."
0,...even though it clearly says it does. I'm SO annoyed!!! Just waited almost 10 mts for it to download only to have it says it's not compatible with my operating system. ugh!!
1,Easy to work with. Not a huge program and havent had any issues with it. prevented a lot of problems. would even recommend buying the pro version.
0,I had all kinds of problems installing it.  Finally gave up and installed another internet security product by a different company.
1,Very user friendly and filing was very easy.
0,"It's ok, says its free but its only a trial you have to pay to keep it."
1,This product is great and is very detailed and precise! It is so easy to follow and complete your taxes!
1,In my home are two adults.  Each file separately in the same state.  I was able to prepare both a federal and state return for each of us.     No issues on the install.  It worked perfectly the first time.
1,I've been using avast for many years and have never found a better anti-virus software. the best out there. thanks
1,"Love Avast! Finds all threats & viruses, great protection! Thank you so much"
0,"My biggest complaint is that e-file costs extra ($17.99).  Also, seemed to create an error in assigning last year's state refund as taxable in the calculations despite it deciding that last year's state refund was not a taxable income because of alternative minimum tax.    Contrary to what others have said it does do schedule C (at least basic sched C - profit/loss from business)."
1,QuickBooks Online is a great software as a service product. The user experience is extremely intuitive. I find this software great even for those with little accounting or financial experience.
0,I think the way they did this year was terrible.  They changed the Turbo Tax Deluxe and eliminated a lot of things I used for other peoples taxes that I did for them.  Such as business.  They should have sent people e-mails to warn them but they did not.  Not very Happy this year :(
1,"Norton has always been my product of choice, although I had intended to get the 360 product instead of this one for its added features.  This one does a good job.  I do still need to use other products as well sometimes"
1,"I used this for Step 1 prep, and loved it. The information is high-yield and helpful, and the study format can't be beat. This approach is head and shoulders above the traditional cram/flash cards/review book routine- it actually helps you learn by incorporating spaced repetition, games, multiple study formats, and intelligent multiple-choice design. I gughlu recommend it to anyone for any exam prep."
1,"So far, Avast free antivirus has been great.  It updates frequently throughout a 24 hr period.  I have been with Avast for about 4 years and have had no problems with computer virus protection.  Thanks, Avast."
0,"Quicken turns out to be crippleware!<br />This is unbelievable. Up until now, people used their Quicken as long as they liked it, upgrading only when they chose to. The only thing they might lose was Intuit \\""support\\"" which was a joke anyway. Here I am perfectly happy with my version of Quicken Essentials for the Mac on my machine, and Quicken 2012 for Windows on hers, and along comes Intuit and tells us they are going to intervene between us and our banks and credit card companies and cut off our right to have our EXISTING versions of our PAID-FOR software connect to our financial institutions unless we each buy upgrades that may or may not work as well! As a consumer, I question the wisdom of this move; and, were I to submit and buy these so-called upgrades, how long do we get to use them before Intuit threatens to cut off our links to our financial institutions again unless we buy the next \\""upgrade\\"" and the next and the next?"
0,"I had an older version of Quicken and was forced to renew because they were no longer supporting my version. After doing so, I needed to call them for help and was put three times on forever hold, never to have help provided at all. I ended up getting my help through an online chat not related to Quicken. The only good that came out of this upgrade was that the annoying upgrade message went away. There are portions of the new software that are very difficult to use, and I wish I could have the old version back again without the annoying message. This was as I see it simply a \\""force a sale\\"" ploy for which I had no recourse whatsoever."
1,Love it!  Still figuring it out !
0,"Another disappointed long time user here. Having waited out the removal of schedule D from Deluxe, I purchased the download product with one State return after their management decision to include it on 2/7/2015. The installation and automatic no cost upgrade to Premier went smoothly.    All was well until It came time to download the one included State tax prep software, at which point I was informed an additional 39.95 would be required.  Calls to Turbotax utilizing their assignment of an incident number and automatic call back procedure is yet to provide any response after six hours and an overnight wait.    UPDATE  Approximately 24 hours after my automated assignment of an incident number, I was called back by a rep. She added the State I needed while still on the phone and computer, at no cost."
0,"Don't buy it unless you already have a video card.  I've spent more money trying to make it work than I paid for the software.  I cannot find a video card that meets both my computer's requirements and Studio 17's requirements.  Save your money, forget this software."
0,"Quicken for MAC is not a very good program.  The PC version does lots more things such as adding up expenditures and showing individual totals for accounts.  The MAC version is just a basic ledger.  It works like a check register--just the basic info.  The PC version is great, the MAC version is terrible."
0,"If you're looking for a transparent anti-virus, this one isn't.<br />It frequently chats about updates and on occasion distracts from what you are doing when no threat is present."
1,the avast antivirus is the best I have found so far really no free antivirus works as well as this one if you are looking into an antivirus but don't want to pay any money but still want the coverage of an antivirus that you pay for look no further than avast  you'll find nothing better in my opinion
0,"Fails at the most basic tasks. Inexplicably, they've removed the ability to edit memorized payees. So, import your bank statement. Quicken categorizes, say, your paycheck with a single category. But you need to add categories for all the deductions (Fed tax, state tax, SS, etc.). One by one you type them in. Guess what? Next time you import a statement, for that exact same payee, you'll have to re-type all of the categories in the split. Same is true for non-split transactions. For a memorized payee, there's simply no way to permanently change the category applied.<br /><br />You could do this in 2007 and previous versions by editng the &#34;Memorized Transactions&#34; list. In their wisdom, Intuit has done away with this. Quicken support claims that it will apply the last used categories, but that does not happen."
0,"I bought my old favorite, WordPerfect, in order to enjoy &#34;Reveal Codes&#34; and &#34;Flush Right&#34;, two extremely useful features that are missing in all other word processing programs. I got what I paid for, but not much more. It's pretty primitive looking once you have worked with newer versions of Word for a while. Too bad - WordPerfect still has great potential, though. Developers, get moving!"

Even Windows Upgrade Advisor will still falsely claim that the Anytime Upgrade will work.  Amazon's listing should clearly state this requirement."
1,No problem
1,I am new to Windows 8 so that learning hurdle is still getting perfecting. My old version of Quicken would not work with it so had to get Quicken 2013.  I love quicken - have used it for years.  The only thing so far I am having trouble with is hitting return to enter info and it automatically inserts the transaction- oops- I wasn't finished and sometimes it puts in data I don't want so I have to go back and correct.  Be sure to TAB!! until ready to complete.

Avast!Safezone is intrusive addition that tells you to switch to safe mode, it keeps popping up all the time.

However, found that I needed some of the features of 8.1 Pro so I rolled the dice and bought this upgrade in spite of the poor reviews. I'm glad I did as it was very painless for me. Lose a star for the excessive cost."
0,"Intuit's money-back guarantee seems to be pure smoke. I'm coming from the PC versions and decided to go for the Mac version this year because I switched computers, only to find out basic features like multi-currency support are not included in the Mac product. I thought I'd just returned and buy the PC version and run it in a VM, but the process to actually get a refund from Intuit has been a nightmare. I followed the required process and in spite of  5 e-mails, 3 voice mails and an hour and a half on the phone with customer service, I haven't even received an acknowledgment that the refund will take place. This has taken 3 weeks already and the waste of time and energy is excessive.<br />It seems they make the &#34;satisfaction guaranteed&#34; claim to inspire confidence, but then leave you hanging when you actually try to make them fulfill that promise."
1,"Before I got quickbooks, my personal finances where a nightmare due to ignorance-based mismanagement of my 100% independent contractor/1099 income.  With the help of QuickBooks instruction and prompting as well as their payroll services, I am now completely confident of the accuracy of my books and tax filings.  QuickBooks has saved my future by educating and empowering me to control my finances with confidence, freeing me to be proactive instead of reactive with my financial situation."
1,"Quicken is one of the best software packages for managing your finances that ever existed in my opinion.  The ONLY drawback is the new versions cost almost as much as the first version.  Fortunately, I have been able to get the software at a reduced price by either bundling it with TurboTax or just not upgrading.  i have been using Quicken for over two decades and I have tried many other software products to replace it, but nothing comes close.  The minor changes each yeasr are not worth the price of the upgrade in my opinion."
1,"It provided everything I expected, and some. Plus it was easy to follow, and use. Keeps you abreast of your tax liability throughout the process."
1,"Have been using Quicken for over 12 years, upgrade every year. Excellent product, features continue to increase. Very easy to track expenses and manage cash flow. Free and easy download of transactions from all my financial institutions, easy to use bill pay."
1,"So far sooooo good, great price. downloaded fast and easy, Happy Happy. I have not used as much as want to, need to get more familiar with the autodesk 360 help."
0,"I purchased the value pack only because QuickBooks/Intuit is forcing customers to upgrade the accounting software every three years in order to use the payroll software.  On the box it clearly states in black and white that ONE employee is included in the purchase price and additional employees are $2.00.  I had to call to set up the payroll software, which I have to do every year, I spoke with a man who after repeating that I purchased the enhanced software helped to set up my computer.  I asked him what charges I would see for two extra employees, he stated $4.00.  I am now seeing a charge of $26.16 on my bank statement.  What the hell<br />QuickBooks flat out lied to everyone, please tell the truth to your consumers.  So be careful when ordering this software, be very careful"

1,"Works great, I use Windows 8 have an i3 Intel processor with 4 Gigs of ram and it still renders HD video much faster than I expected. No crashes so far unlike my previous video editing software. The only downside is the learning curve and low availability of instructions. I just played with it for a few hours and figured out enough to use it and be happy with the results."
0,Never down loaded.
1,"Awesome product,  works great for all device, easy & fast to install.  Keep up the great job Norton!Doing it right"
1,"We have used Quicken for years.  We had it on our old laptop and when it died, we got a new computer with this new version.  Love the updates."
1,"Over the years, I had had enough issues and unresolved problems with Norton products that I had gotten to the point where I was done with them.  Frankly speaking, most people I have heard expressing an opinion about Norton products in the past ten years to fifteen years usually complained about what a resource hog it had become and yet it was not even that effective as a virus protector.  After Zone Alarm stumbled out of the gate when Windows 7 came to the market, I tried Norton again and they seem to have gotten it right this time.  It's not so super hyper like one product I tried that it keeps you from doing normal things you need to do and yet it appears to get the job done while running quietly in the background.  Honestly, one highly rated product I tried became so alarmed when I attempted to download Adobe music player that it totally took over my machine and locked me out from doing anything further.  I'll hang with Norton as long as they don't stumble again.  Let's hope they don't."
0,I Have been try to installing Norton for two hours wont install please give me my money back.
1,nice
1,"Well first I can't rate this bad really. It is Quicken, downloaded fine, installed fine. But I have to say that other than being able to sync with the app on your phone, (which is free), there really isn't anything special about this new version. If you don't care about using your cell phone with it, save yourself the money and keep the old version or buy an older version. I can't see a difference in the 2011 version I had and this one otherwise. I am a past Quicken user so I know what to expect and it works for what I use it for and what it says it will do and honestly it pretty much has done the same thing for years with the exception of a few minor layout changes here and there. Can't say it's any worse or better, though I myself do like that I can put my cash expenses on my phone. No more worrying about saving receipts and that is a big plus!"
1,The software works very well once you learn how to navigate some of it's quirkiness. Once mastered it is quite a powerful video editing software for not a king's ransom.
1,"Last year, My tax lady (for many years) retired leaving me at the last minute to get my taxes done.This year I'd figured I would give Turbo Tax a chance so I could do it without the hassles and cost of having somebody else. After I was done I felt like a fool to have paid someone all these years to do something so simple. With Turbo Tax and using last year's tax papers as a guide; I had it done in about an hour and a half."
1,gets the job done for everything I need for my business. i would suggest using it for home use only the ipad version is very limited.
1,Used it before. Program works for me.
1,"user friendly, clear and frequent updates, and free!!! thank you!"
1,"If it were not for the illegal IRS, Turbo Tax would go out of business.  In the meantime, there is Turbo Tax."
1,"Loving this program!  I downloaded the trial to check it out and the next day had a senior moment.  I was cleaning up my emails and accidentally deleted 6 months of important emails.  Yikes!  I started to panic and then remembered Rollback Rx.  15 minutes later I had all my emails back.  This probably sounds like one of those glorious false testimonials, but it's the real deal.  This program works as intended and works well.  I'm definitely buying it for all my pc's and I'll be getting their backup/cloning program as well.  I've already gotten my money's worth and haven't even bought it yet!"
1,I used it on a Ubuntu machine running Windows 98 under Vbox.  No problems.  Will do the same thing again next year.
1,I've been using Avast Free antivirus now for a couple years and it has worked very well. It's comparable to many paid options I've tried. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution to protect their computer.
1,"I've always used this and have never had issues with the speed of getting through, thoroughness of the return, and resources to quickly get questions answered.  My returns once checked and cleared by the program have never had issues at the IRS with electronic submittals."
1,Have used Quicken for many years - Awesome software.
1,I still need to see if I can trust turbo tax
1,great software!
0,"The software adds a Microsoft account that complicated my system login and is more of a nuisance than anything else.  Microsoft technical support was not able to fix the issue in with three representatives and Amazon customer service actually was the one to corner the issue and suggested it may be the Microsoft Account.  Considering the fact that there is free cloud software, I am looking into other alternatives that are more intuitive.  The software quality is good however if there are alternatives out there that are less expensive and without the hassles I will lean toward those."
0,"I have been a Turbo Tax customer for many years.  Wow, when it was disclosed by so many other Turbo Tax users that a Intuit corporate decision to exclude C, D and E schedules from the Deluxe software version for 2014.  I decided to look elsewhere this year for a replacement.  Unfortunately I feel very sad to say goodbye Turbo Tax.  Buyers beware and expect to pay more for their Premier version for what you had in prior years."
1,good
0,program full of download errors! download issues through microsoft. was on tech support past few days. they said thy are having issues with the program install. i can wait no longer for them to resolve. poor product! cant believe microsoft has simple issues like this without resolving before it gets to amazon. now i am for sure going to mac!
0,"Bought Quicken just over 2 years ago. My checking bank provides downloads. Didn't want to use all the bells and whistles..just download my checking transactions so I have a history. About 2 months ago Quicken started giving messages that the download capability would be expired soon and I had to renew. Really ? A simple feature such as that and I'm getting pressed to renew. They can ...  Well you know. Now downloading to Excel. Keeping it simple. Any other program would just keep working, but not this one."
1,"It's Darth, all right.  While some of these celebrity gps voices are repetitive, there is some variety in Vader's directions, which spices things up a bit.  The voice quality is good; easy to understand. I recommend it.  Now, I want those plans ..."
0,"I get H&R Block software every year.  Being self employed, I usually have a question or 2 for the support staff.  This particular year the staff was NOT HELPFUL AT ALL... Because of incorrect information I was given several times, I purchased extra products that did not fit the application.  I spoke with several members of the support staff and the only thing that I remember being consistent among them was how they each defended the other and indicated &#34;the customer is always wrong&#34;.  It was so horrible I asked for a refund!"
0,"First use it crashed my computer. Can't use safe mode, says error when I try system restore. I have lost everything. I called they couldn't help saying they had to email California to have them email me in 24-48 hours, cause they have no direct line to California from wherever in India they are. This software use to be amazing I will never use it again now."
1,I keep trying other software. I keep going back to this one. Just fel more secure and I guess I'm comfortable with the format.
0,This software is horrible.  Do not spend your money on this software.
1,"Having been a Windows user for decades, I moved to the MAC environment because of the integration between my iPhone and iPad and now my home desktop (iMac) and laptop (Macbook Air).  Although I am slowly learning the Apple suite of Pages, Numbers and Keynote, I needed to be able to continue working more effectively in the software which I have been using.  Office for Mac gives me the same programs without having to set up a virtual Windows environment on my Macs.  I am just as productive as I was with my Windows computers and did not have to learn all this new Windows 8 stuff.  I am now much more productive with my Mac devices than I ever was with Windows and when I learn the Apple productivity suite programs better I can use both the Apple and Microsoft productivity software to their individual best advantage."
0,"My findings (Over the past couple of months).<br />My 2011 downloads stopped working! After upgrading tried to download from Wells. Said \\""I had pending transactions\\"", when I said OK it canceled. So tried deactivating connecting screen did not show a web connect option - only direct connect. You do not want a direct connect, banks charge for that. Called Quicken, got voice mail (what a surprise) 2 days later with no call from them I tried again. This time there was a web connect option was available. Again I had to deactivate, & activate. Finally; a connection, information was now flowing. As best that I can tell I'm getting all my Wells checking data. Several days later I tried to connect for a download. Looked like working, was not. I knew there was information to download. I deactivated & activated (again), went through the connection process & sure enough I got transactions. Long story short \\""for me\\"" it appears I must deactivate, & activate every time I try to connect, otherwise I get nothing. This may or may not help others, I only updated because my connection in 2011 version was terminated by Quicken. My rating, 1 star is generous.<br />The review By B. King should be helpful; I believe it is a generous rating.<br />The review By UKFigs be helpful; I believe it is a generous rating.<br />The review By Daniel M. Austin should be helpful;<br /><br />5.19.2014<br />Response to the Quicken comments.<br />I am not receiving error \\""CC-502\\"". Support read my complaint with upgrade.  Wells did not change the connection method, never received any correspondence that they were. I was told by Wells help desk that Quicken (Intuit) has connection issues, they would not say more. Product was purchased to automatically continue to download bank etc. data, not return to the days of everything done manually."
1,Avast was recommended to me by my IT support staff. I have since told family and fiends about it. It is a great virus software program and I have never had any trouble with it!
1,"I am a CPA, and I have always used H&R Block S/W to process my personal return. I like that it is cheaper than TurboTax, and works just as well."
1,If you are coming from Windows and looking for Disk Cleanup you have its bigger brother.  It works very well at finding and cleaning files on a Mac.  Bear in mind that sometimes programs have their own uninstaller and won't uninstall properly if you use this program to uninstall.  But overall its a great program. and the developer is actively maintaining and providing updates to better the product and support the latest Mac OS. At the time of this review it has been updated to work on Mavericks.
1,Really great software!
0,I am a border Mexico-USA inhabitant. They detected I am right now in the Mexican side and I will need to cross the border to download the software I already paid.<br />I will wait for having to go there. The car line is two hours long. Thank you Microsoft for your national profiling.
1,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this.  The download was quick and easy, and Word, Excel, and Power Point are working well.  Power point options are somewhat limited for this edition."
0,"tons of pop ups all of a sudden not being filtered out, frozen screens too. shame there's no other option for spyware"
1,easy to use and accurate
1,"Maybe a smidgen less user friendly than Turbo Tax, but sure a bunch cheaper.  Just like all computerized  solutions, you have to know what you're doing, it doesn't do your thinking for you.  Neither does Turbo Tax.  I'll get it next year too, if the price is right."
1,always works which is more than I can say for thing like Microsoft which allowed in a virus that wiped out my computer
1,"FileMaker released the FileMaker 14 platform on May 12, 2015 adding exciting new features to all products in the FileMaker family including FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Pro Advanced (developer version), FileMaker Go, WebDirect, and FileMaker Server.<br /><br />Here we provide overview of some of the new features of FileMaker 14 along with a few notes and links to many resources for more detailed information. Some of the big goals of FileMaker 14 included:<br /><br />1. Creating solutions quickly and at low cost<br />2. Supporting mobile solutions even better<br />3. Delivering browser-based solutions with improved WebDirect<br />4. Making the platform reliable, secure, and scalable<br /><br />FileMaker 14<br /><br />Many of the features of FileMaker 14 are developer-focused enhancements. End users (those that may not actually develop or code) may not see them immediately, but they will see improved speed of delivery of new features and ability to create new functionality that was not possible in the past.<br /><br />The system requirements for FileMaker Pro are Mac OS 10.9 or Windows 7 and above. There are now separate versions of FileMaker for Windows 32 and 64 bit clients. Be careful with plugins that may only support the 32 bit version. You may need to update them first.<br /><br />The FileMaker interface has been modernized and has become more flat according to recent design trends.<br /><br />Script Workspace – Major changes have been made to the editing of scripts. You can now type scripts with context sensitive help.<br /><br />Calculation Dialog Box – All new and enhanced to make it as easy as possible to create calculations quickly.<br /><br />Design Tool Enhancements – Many tools and options are new or modernized<br /><br />* Improved Color Picker – With theme color options.<br />* Button Bars – You can now define a row or column of buttons with uniform size and formatting. They are made up of segments that are buttons or popover buttons. Text label, icon, or both can be added to each segment.<br />* Field Placeholders / In-Field Labels – Allow you to clearly label fields by showing what they are when empty without taking valuable screen real-estate.<br />* Button Icons – Custom Button Glyphs for buttons, popover buttons, and button bar segments…custom icon in .svg format. Conditional Formatting of the button icon also include color options.<br />* Navigation Parts – Top and Bottom Layout Parts<br />* Object component styles to control how objects look – Customize formatting of component parts of control styles: pop-up menu, drop-down list, drop-down calendar, checkbox set, and radio button set<br />Launch Center and File Icons – Present a new clean way to select databases.<br /><br />Minimalist or Minimalist Touch themes – New themes should start with these themes that provide a clean slate with no custom predefined styles.<br /><br />Better Starter Solutions – Event Management and Projects pre-built templates have been enhanced.<br /><br />FileMaker WebDirect<br /><br />WebDirect is the option that allows FileMaker databases to be deployed quickly to the web and maintain a lot of the FileMaker type of functionality.<br /><br />WebDirect is now substantially faster (up to 25%) and less resource intensive. Now the user limit has increased from 50 simultaneous users to 100. WebDirect now supports mobile browsers like Chrome for Android.<br /><br />FileMaker Go 14<br /><br />FileMaker Go provides more control on iOS through the following features:<br /><br />* The new user interface that cleans up the icons and makes them more intuitive.<br />* Rich text editing in fields.<br />* New Functions include: Get(ScreenScaleFactor), Get(MenubarState), and Get(TouchKeyboardState)<br />* Insert from Device now has additional customization options for signature capture<br />* Scripts that lock screen orientation (Portrait, Portrait Upside Down, Landscape Left, Landscape Right), enhance signature capture, allow control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations. It is more specific than Refresh Window [Flush cached join results].<br />* Show/Hide Menubar option for FileMaker Go and WebDirect<br />* Enable Touch Keyboard  for iOS or Windows 8 when then tap into an editable field<br /><br />FileMaker 14 Server<br /><br />Reconnect to server when a connection is lost in FileMaker Pro should save a lot of frustration. Previous versions of FileMaker Pro required login whenever a computer went to sleep or the network connection changed. It does this by allowing the fmreauthenticate extended privilege to apply to FileMaker Pro clients (not just FileMaker Go). If the machine goes to sleep when you return you are auto reconnected if time is within the limit. For example, fmreauthenticate120 would be a 2 hour setting (minutes). The maximum time limit is 10080 minutes or 7 days.<br /><br />The new Standby Server option for experienced system administrators aids in upgrades and maintenance. It takes over for a primary server if it is offline or unavailable. The server config and hosted data files must be identical. It can be used for unexpected failure of server due to power loss, hard drive, or catastrophe or a planned server outage. The changeover process is manual and configured by command line so it isn’t designed to be used as automatic failover. This second standby server does not require an additional software license. Progressive backup must be enabled for both installations.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />FileMaker 14 represents a big step forward in providing additional features, performance enhancements, and security / reliability while balancing it with maintaining it’s ease of use.<br /><br />Existing FileMaker solutions do not automatically gain all of the features of FileMaker 14. Some features will require reworking of layouts, scripts, and other objects…development time to take advantage of the new capabilities.<br /><br />We recommend that FileMaker users wait a while and do some testing with any existing solutions before deployment. If you’re building a brand new solution, dive right in and begin using FileMaker 14.<br /><br />FileMaker is 30 years old today (5/12/15) and this year the FileMaker DevCon (Developer Conference) is celebrating its 20th year. The platform has come a long way.<br /><br />http://cimbura.com/tech/2015/05/12/new-filemaker-14-released/low control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations.

0,I am totally new to quickbooks but got with encouragement from my Cpa. They told me to get the desktop version but I needed to be mobile. It was so far from user friendly and even my Cpa who has much experience could not figure things out without needing help I m going back to free mint.com which did just about everything (minus payroll and invoices) for free!
1,"I have used many free antivirus programs over the past thirty years and this is the best.  Easy to use, and fewer false positives than others."
0,"Just wanted to post a comment on this Tax software! I have been using Turbo Tax for ever. I was on their AUTO BUY and had the software sent to my house every year automatically. I cancelled it this year because of the PRICE jump and what they did to the to the software making you have to go to the more expensive product for certain features. I was shocked to see the almost 300 1 star reviews, and a VP of Turbo Tax replying to the comments. Guys, remember &#34;NETFLIX&#34;?? I bought H&R Block tax software this year mostly due to price. Again I used your software for years and years and loved it but if someone is going to give me the same service for almost half less with all the features & SUPPORT I need and not have to go to the next level for additional features.... BAD MOVE!!"
0,"I like some of the features of Elements 11, like the face recognition.  But, I couldn't figure out how to make a slideshow movie after hours of trying."
1,The free program works well for the casual user of the computer. I have used for several years with no problems.
1,"Another relatively painless year of doing the taxes with TurboTax. There was not a single &#34;hidden fee&#34; or any additional fee beyond what I paid Amazon, despite the claims in other reviews. Yes, state e-file might cost extra, but it says that right in the product description. If you don't want to pay that fee, there's no cost to print and mail your state tax, as I did for many years until my state recently prohibited tax software from charging for e-filing. And there were opportunities to purchase additional services but nothing was required.<br /><br />Would've been five stars but I had an apparently common issue transmitting my forms -- TurboTax said that an update was required, but no updates were available. Online suggestions to quit TurboTax, empty the trash, and restart directly from the Applications folder (rather than from Launchpad) solved the issue."
0,I was unable to download the program so I purchased program containing the disc.
0,"As a long time Premiere Pro/Final Cut Pro user I needed to update to something, but Adobe prices are so high I went with the elements combo. I just needed a simple video editor, but I have to say this software out right sucks. It may work for those who use iMovie, etc, but I found it frustrating and limited. I couldn't capture into it or edit in basic formats. I'm looking into other brands lower cost video editors.  I'm pissed that I can't return it since it is useless and there is no support. At best you can ask the internet for help which didn't work for me."
0,I purchased through Amazon.  The download took over 2 hrs. and I have good internet access and a new computer.  The program is difficult to use.  I called Amazon to return and they do not accept returns for software.  They could not provide contact information for Adobe contacts.  Ended call with an apology and to look at Adobe's website for help.
1,There are many features that I have not been able to access as easily as the desktop version which I have been a user of since 1997.  There are some new features that are very nice.
0,"Bought early and had to pay extra for state,  a big surprise."
1,"Originally I filed a very negative review for the seller (not the product - the product is excellent. I use it yearly) and then complained to amazon.com<br />The problem was the lack of the state program which normally comes with it. Amazon immediately corrected the problem to my fullest satisfaction. However, be aware that this program is for people who ONLY need the Federal return software. If you need the state filing software as well you need to buy the OTHER Turbotax product which includes both, Federal and State. Thank you Amazon.com."
1,Easy to use and follow. A definite value versus TAXCUT.  I tried TaxCut 2 years ago and ended up coming back to H&R the following year. They are  similar but H&R is much less.  I also use to file for both sets of our parents so I use multiple states. I use e-file function and all works well.
0,"This software is a huge step backwards.  I started with Quicken in 1992 - 23 years ago!  I use it predominantly to write and print checks for my employer's five accounts.  I managed to hold off ditching Quicken 2006 for years, but when I replaced my computer I had no choice but to upgrade to Quicken 2014.  I used to actually enjoy &#34;accounts payable batch&#34; days.  It was a vicarious thrill to spend gobs of money and whip out 150 checks in short order.  Now I dread it.  Earlier versions remembered the most recent check written to a payee.  I could immediately tell if I was entering a check already paid (sometimes checks and invoices cross in the mail).  This version only remembers the last time I &#34;memorized&#34; a payee.  So, let's say I memorize a check to ABC in January.  I write a check to ABC every month thereafter.  In every subsequent month,  Quicken will still be autofilling the January information (rather than the previous month's information like earlier versions of Quicken did).  Quicken 2014 is riddled with these little annoyances.  In the check writing pane, when I move from one account to another, it invariably stops me with the query &#34;Save last transaction?&#34;  If I press &#34;Yes,&#34; it saves a blank check.  If I press &#34;No,&#34; it allows me to continue.  Since I am jamming through a blizzard of bills, this distraction ticks me off.  The interface with my printer leaves a lot to be desired, and the ability to customize reports is weaker than any version of Quicken I have ever used.  I'm using a Mac and running Parallels with Windows 7 so that I can have my Quicken (the Quicken for Mac was such a holy-hell mess that I gave up on it after a mere two frustrating weeks).  I give it two stars because, at the end of the day, it does function.  However, I now spend a lot of time researching other check writing software, hoping to find something better.  With Quicken's descent into terrible mediocrity, I expect that something better willbe along soon.  I'm so disappointed that a once spectacular software has degenerated into this clunky, user-hostile piece of junk."
1,"Switching to Quickbooks Online Simple Start made it so that I never lose track of my cashflow. As a small business owner I have a lot to keep track of, but quickbooks makes it so that keeping track doesn't mean worrying about.<br /><br />I can invoice with ease, see a quick snapshot of income and expenses, and best of all my accountant knows and loves the software so come tax time I dont have to do anything."
1,I use this program to keep up with three different accounts. My wife used it to administer her Mother's two year Estate until it was settled. She was very much pleased and it enabled the Estate to be recorded to the penny over that two year perion.
1,"I downloaded this product yesterday. It installed quickly and did an update from the Block site when I launched it. It found my TaxCut 2008 file on my hard drive, imported everything perfectly, and walked me through the process. An hour later, I did the free eFile.    This morning I had an email from Block telling me there was a problem with my return. The email told me how to check (from within the program) what was wrong. When I launched the program it told me that there was an inconsistency between what I had entered regarding the $250 stimulus checks last year and what the IRS records showed. Sure enough, I had provided erroneous information. I corrected it and resubmitted my return.    My taxes are done, my Estimated Tax vouchers for next years are printed up, and my refund will be deposted in my checking account in a few days.    What more could I ask for?"
0,"Whenever I try to run to scan my PC, I always get message symentac encounter problem to open this program."
0,"Microsoft has really gone backwards with this iteration of Outlook.  The whole Office suite is really poorly designed.  From the purchase to the download, to the startup, to the operation, there has been nothing fun or simple about the product or install.  I am confident this is the last time I get suckered into paying for overpriced Microsoft Office products.  What a disappointment.  Stark white backgrounds, no simple tool for composing emails, no way to import old address books, no way to view sent mail (REALLY!), just plain poorly designed.  I wish the execs at Microsoft would watch a group of average users try to install and operate their products before selling them to the general public.  There is no way anyone can really enjoy this garbage software, is there?!?!?"

0,"I just got a confirmation email from H&R Block to receive my FREE deluxe version, having supplied my Turbotax info. Here's what you need: Email SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com with your name, address, phone number, operating system (Mac or Windows), and a scan or email showing proof of TurboTax Basic or Deluxe purchase.<br /><br />Used TurboTax for many, many, many years -- disgusted with their price increase and flabby, incredulous rationale.<br /><br />So, I have moved to H&R this year, hoping all my data transfers according to their claim that it will.<br /><br />Good luck!"
1,Great program! Don't know why I didn't start using it sooner!!
1,I started to use this software at work and I like it so much that I had to buy it for home even though I need it more at work.  It is so easy to &#34;snag&#34; a screen shot by just hitting the Print Screen key --- and adding a few circles or other drawings is a snap.
1,Just right for what I need. It let's you set it for a weekly scan or you can do a scan when you need it.
1,Satisfied

0,"Quicken's Debt management portion had problems since 2010 version. As a user, you are unable to enter your minimum payment values for your bills.  Instead the program estimates a value that is 3 to 4 times higher than your actually amount for all bills. Several user's have contacted Quicken about this problem for years. Quicken has yet to fix it."
1,Simple and more protective than any other antivirus I've used. Avast found things that others couldn't. I recommend it to everyone.
1,"My review of this program is essentially the same as Norton Internet Security 2013.  It's a good anti-virus program with some performance penalties.  If you are using a laptop with a solid state drive, I would insure that the optimization feature is turned off."
1,"I recently bought a new laptop, and needed word processing.  I'm used to working with Word, and so I looked at buying an updated version of that popular app.  But when I saw that the prices for the Microsoft program was almost as much as the price of my laptop, I knew I had to find something else.  Apache OpenOffice works reasonably well.  There are still some things I either can't do with it, but that may just be my own lack of familiarity with the program.  I've tried to set it up for spell check in Spanish, and to print page numbers, but without any success.  Again, this may just be a factor of it working differently than what I'm used to.  Also, though I have been able to open its docs on other computers using Word, I have had the experience of other people not being able to open the docs.  In that case, I print it to a pdf and re-send it so that they can read it.  But again, at this price, FREE, I'm pretty satisfied."
0,"Horrible.  It seems that the more years I have Quicken, the worse it gets.  I thought software updates are supposed to be better!  I got this LAST WEEK & already went from a perfectly working &#34;release 5&#34;  when I purchased it.  2 days later they had a &#34;release 6&#34; update, of which I had immediate problems with it.  I was on the phone for 67 minutes on hold & 43 minutes waiting for a chat-line to open up.  They could not help me but said that the release 7 would be out in a couple weeks to fix the new release 6 glitches.  Quicken has went totally downhill since I got the first one in 2003. Sad.  I need other options."
0,The state forms are included but they hit you with a $19.95 and 29.95 more on top of that if you dont pay with a credit card for e-file fee for state but not untill you are in the process of filing. Very crocked practice. Buyer beware!
0,"Alas, in my desperation to once and for all abandon the awkward technology that is Windows, I ignored the sound advice of the many reviewers regarding the limited functionality of Quicken for Mac. Notable is the insufficient flexibility in developing reports and budgeting. Don't make the same mistake as I did. If all you need is a check register, then this will work. But it doesn't come anywhere close to matching the functionality of the Windows version."
1,"[[ASIN:B008S0IV9G QuickBooks for Mac 2013 [Download]]]My business was growing and I still wasn't the most organized in the 'paperwork department.' QuickBooks was highly recommended by several entrepreneurial friends.<br />I was a little worried about using QB on my Mac because they all have PC's. I found the website 'Intuit Quickbooks for Mac - Little Square' and have NO worries. There are no questions that I've asked that I couldn't find an answer or video for.<br />The accounting required for my business; invoices, estimates, and other reports are a breeze. A few minutes every day working with the incredibly user friendly QuickBooks puts everything where it belongs. With it all being in the right place, I no longer dread my bookkeeping."
1,"My favorite feature is the app.  I know that earlier reviews say that it was buggy, I think they got the kinks worked out.  I can write a check and enter it into my phone, then sink to my computer when I'm paying bills and there it is.  Now my wife and I can be on the same page with our finances."
0,it seems like I'm having a problem with WORD.  it didn't download or something...I have Excel downloaded but I went to use WORD and something happened...like they couldn't find it (or something like that).  So I need to work on it to see if it was downloaded correctly or what?  I thought if it downloaded EXCEL then all the other Office products would also be downloaded correctly.  was I wrong?
1,"I have used Taxcut for Business for over ten years.  It is concise, asks the questions that a tax preparer would ask and allows me to keep a copy that easily fills in the info next year making the return that much easier the next time.  Strongly recommend taxcut business and also the included personal taxcut program.  Even my kid use the program and love it."
0,"I have a new MacBook with the latest OS and Browser as required by this years Basic disc. I bought the disc instead of downloading it just because the computer is new. When I put the disc in, it makes assorted noise, then the computer spits it back out. No installation, nothing occurs on screen, nada.<br />I tried to look online as to why that would happen and found nothing. I thought I saw somewhere that it requires 1024x768 SVGA monitor so I changed my screen settings but the result was the same.  I don't see any help on HRBlock.com  -- am I supposed to return the disc to Amazon for a refund and try the download, or what? I've never had problems with H&R Block's software until today."
0,"This program corrupted my files. I had to uninstall and during the uninstallation my computer was crippled. It's way too big, unnecessary. I hate it."
1,"I give 5 stars to this download software, because it gives what it expects. A good softerware working, Coreldraw and 4 more add-on, no sofware crushes, easy to redownload if you need to change your computer with oyur same key.<br /><br />As a designer i choose this product for the easy keyboard configuration, and practice to use.<br /><br />I will recommend it to does who are designers, it may work to ilustrator, not recommending it to make texts works like magazine, literature books, etc. Its has it options for these type of work, but is more usefull to design and ilustration.<br /><br />You need to see witch softerware works more with you. But you will know Corel will work great. I recommend it."
0,"Background: I'm a long time quicken user and the last version I was using prior to this is 2012.<br /><br />This 2014 version offers very, very little improvements to the 2012 version that I was using. I should have listened to the reviews here and saved my money. In fact, I am so disappointed that I would like to give this review a one star but I know that's not fair to the product so I gave it a 3. I'm not sure why Quicken feels compelled to release a &#34;new&#34; version every year. Wait. Scratch that. I know why they release a &#34;new&#34; version every year. MONEY!<br /><br />On the other hand, had I been a first time quicken user, I would probably rate this version a five star.<br /><br />Hope this gives you some perspective."
1,"This program keeps my computers running at top performance.  Windows and I have a love/hate relationship, and Glary Utilities Pro keeps them Microsoft rascals in their place."
0,Don't buy this item as the price offered is a complete rip off. Same price is offered through tomtom site for the year of subscription services and not 6 month
0,"First time Norton user.  Tried to create an account numerous times.  The website keeps kicking me back asking me for my correct email address and pass word.  I'm trying to create an account here.  It's ignoring the &#34;create account&#34; button and acting like I'm just trying to log into an existing account.  I purchased the download version and it looks like Amazon doesn't provide a way to get a refund.  Very frustrating.  Should have purchased this at Costco.  No problems with returns there. Update: Called Norton support (800-844-3362).  Got connected to what was an obvious off-shore boiler room. The tech informed me that I could get charged for the troubleshooting diagnosis depending on the problem.  After several attempts to get the tech to comprehend the problem, I ended the call. The download version is on a deal-of-the-day sale ($27.99) today.  Don't waste your time. Update 2: Several hours later, I was able to register as a new customer and then downloaded the software without issue. There is an annoying pop-up you will inherit if you accept the recommended load configuration. I leveraged the Control Panel to find and get rid of it.  As mentioned, support was a nightmare (see below) so I didn't call them again.  However, I feel compelled to upgrade the product  to 3 stars.  It is working, Norton did respond to this posting, and and the price was right.  The issue I was having with the website registration process may have been due to an overwhelming response to the sale.  I suspect the Norton support staff was equally overwhelmed. Update3: To be fair, it now looks like I was not talking to Norton Support.  After they fixed their website, I was able to create an account and get the correct Norton Support phone number.   Perhaps if I ordered the key card version a support phone number would have been on it.  I went back and checked all emails & links received from Both Amazon & Norton.  Nowhere can I find a support phone number.  This is kind of a catch 22 if you order the downloaded version as I did.  It puts you in search mode which opens traps like the won I walked into.  Fortunately,  I ended the conversation and did not turn over control of my computer."
1,"I used this rating because Avast is the best antivirus I have ever had,there are so many good things to say about it,it isn't expensive for one thing,it works in the backgriound,updates itself automatically,updates other pertinent apps,runs my firewall,investigates other apps,I would and do recommend it to anyone that wants a good antivirus that won't try to stop you from going wherever you want to go on the internet,they will warn you,yes,but unlike Norton and McAfee,they don't forbid you to go there.I love Avast antivirus.I've had them about six or seven years now."
0,"It worked from the beginning but after formatting PC, It doesn't work when I sync to the Quicken Cloud(using the same file I backed up) even using the same ID and Password. It took me to the step 2 of 2 to register. After filled out all the questions,there was a message &#34; We weren't able to sign you up&#34;."
0,"I have had this download since October 10/24/12 and had nothing but problems, I even let the Adobe Dreamweaver techn take control of my computer to fix the problems with software and he couldn;t get it to work right either loading images in broswer!  I have lost a lot of money, because this was for my business website!  Please refund me asap!<br /><br />Thanks!"
0,"Did not meet my expectations. I purchased a print master years ago and it was much better. Better art, more user friendly, and more  project options. Very Disappointed with this one."
1,I did not get as much of a return as I did last year but again I didn't have to pay...
0,Would not download on iPad or iPhone
0,"They advertised to file your state return for free and then I was told it was restricted to just the basic types of returns.  It also did not recommend the correct filing to give the maximum refund (which was guaranteed).  I had to change one of their recommended options in order to increase my refund.  If I hadn't known that I could have gotten a bigger refund with the option I chose, Turbotax would have calculated a refund about $200 less on my state return."
1,"I had an estimate for several hundred dollars to have my taxes done by a professional. It was much cheaper to use this software to file my taxes. The interview process was painless and through. I did need to research a couple of topics to correctly answer all of the questions, but this had more to do with investment properties. I have used this program for 5+years and do my mother's taxes with it as well. I would recommend as an alternative to having the pros do your taxes, with this software you CAN do them!"
0,This does not include the state filing. There are more charges. To file my state return cost me $62.78 more than the fee to buy the program.  Next year I will use somebody else.
0,this product is not working at all. I would like a full refund for this product. thank you
1,"This program is very nice and comes with an extensive library.  It does take a bit of getting use to and its easy to do sill things like ave the stairs installed backward.  That said, the three-D visualizations were a big help in my project."
0,"This product is designed to lure you in, until next year, when of course you will want to continue your business records and will need to pay 18.99 or MORE per month.  I have the 2010 version of QB and was completely happy until they discontinued features of the product through 'updates' making it impossible to email invoices - now QB wants me to PAY them to EMAIL MY OWN FORMS - something that anyone could do for free with a basic computer and an internet connection.  AWFUL customer service and support and it doesn't matter if you buy the disk or the download - they work the same way and store all of your business records ONLINE.  ANOTHER example of a good product RUINED by greed and stupidity!"
1,It's cheaper than Turbo Tax
0,OK
0,"I could not install it correctly. After an hour with Customer support, they downloaded a different one to my account. The one they downloaded installed AVG bar and all my icons changed ."
1,I have used Quicken for years and each new version has more features.This is a great program for personal fianances.
0,"I have tried McAfee a few times, in the past, and I have always removed it. The first time, years ago, there was so much other stuff included, that I had my computer loaded with unused, unnecessary stuff.  And  my computer would not work right, it kept tripping off.  Other times, about the same thing, my computer just will not work right with this. Perhaps, with some technical help, I could have solved the problems, but I did not want to spend time trying to get it set up, so I returned it and got a refund. Again, perhaps if I tried fine tuning it, it might have been okay, I am sure that McAfee is probably a great Protection software, but it does not work as I want it to, so I don't keep it."
0,"I've been using quicken for over a decade - it works alright, and it was easier to live with the few bugs than to migrate to something else. I was unhappy to be forced to upgrade from Q 2011 (those pesky warnings that download support will stop for Q 2011 soon), but I did it anyway and bought Q 2014. There are 2 wakeup calls that are prompting me to consider moving off of quicken.<br />1. Six months ago, I reported to quicken that online downloads is broken with a certain bank. They acknowledged the problem. When I sent email to ask about status, they responded that email support is discontinued and I must use other means to get support. When I chatted with a support rep, he said I must send email to get status of that problem!! He did confess however that they are STILL working on that problem!!<br />2. Q 2014 is much slower compared to Q 2011"
0,It did not work very well and made some mistakes. I have used it for many years and did not have a problem. I had to have a CPA and tax expert to do the taxes over. I wasted the money on TurboTax and it cost me $150 to have it done over.
1,"I have been a quicken users since about 1992. The program is amazing for tracking all of your finances in one place. I like the budgeting and reporting features. For new users, keep in mind that like any financial tracking program, you are not going to be able to install the software and then you will instantly have all of your information at your fingertips. You need to do the set-up by adding each of your accounts, linking them to your online banking, etc. you can set it up so that the click on one button pulls all transactions from all of my accounts into Quicken. You need to be a good data steward by reconciling the information and assigning what you spend to categories. Once you do and you you get into using the program, you will have a very clear picture of your income and spending. After you use it for a while you will have historical information that you can use to see where you money is going (I spend how much on dining?!?!?!) and then create a budget within the program. I like the alert feature where I get emails for larger purchases or low account balances. I have used the bill pay feature for years an never had a problem. I upgrade by Quicken about every 2 years. With the upgrade I did form v2013 to v2015, the only gripe I have so far is that for several accounts I needed to re-link them to the financial institutions."
0,The product didn't even work
1,"Love Norton. Always have, always will."
0,"Many hours on several computers failed to successfully install this buggy software.  File conversion from previous versions doesn't work, even after you think it might be working.  The last straw was the complete absence of support.  Even after waiting in the Chat queue for 30-40 minutes before reaching number one position, you are told no one is available and are disconnected...again and again!  I am having AMEX stop payment on this junk."
0,"I is not that easy to use, and I was hoping for a program that would allow you to draw your on design."
1,"My wife and I have used this product for years and it is definitely worth trying.  The first year takes the longest to get everything entered in, but after that, subsequent years go a lot faster because the program just uses your previous return files.  On that note, make sure you backup and/or keep the previous years file somewhere handy.  It will save you a headache or two.<br /><br />Again, a great product.  For us, it speeds up the whole process."
1,Very happy with the simplicity and easy instructions for loading this on our household computers.  Computers working much quicker and scans every night as we were able to set the times that suited us best.  Love that it is USA based company.  Recommended highly....four stars only for now since we've only been members for a few weeks.  5 stars for service so far.
0,"Unless I can get Amazon to give me my $99 back, I just got hosed about 8 hours ago. I bought the download. After hours of trying to get the software to work I typed the error codes into Google. I find out from the Inuit site I need patches. What kind of worthless company sells a DOWNLOAD that needs patches?<br /><br />I spend hours downloading the patches that will fix the errors. I finally get them installed, hit the final buttom to finish it out and it says they cannot be installed because I don't have Quickbooks 2012. Hello, I bought it today and it's installed right here.<br /><br />Absolutely ridiculous. Please don't make the mistake I did."
1,Good way to learn
0,"I've used Quicken Home & Business for YEARS without an issue.  The 2014 version seems to be plagued by bugs, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />It seems to &#34;hitch&#34; often, slowing down and then ultimately crashing.  My biggest pet peeve is that accounts are not reconcilable when downloading statements from your bank.  (Reconciling does seem to work fine if you're working from paper statements, but who does THAT anymore?)<br /><br />Intuit's customer service - or lack thereof - doesn't seem to have an answer.  I keep checking the forums on the Intuit site for solutions or new updates to download, but haven't had much success.  Trying to get a human being on the phone is a JOKE.<br /><br />If anyone has an answer to these issues, please feel free to share!<br /><br />Intuit could certainly take a lesson from Amazon in how to meet and exceed customer needs."
0,"This is my first ever review of a product on Amazon.  Sadly, I am not moved to reviewing due to an experience with an amazing product, I am furious over a product that should never have been released for sale.<br /><br />I have been with Quicken since Quicken 2006.  I've been very happy and always felt that Quicken is a great product.  Quicken gave me a technological outlet for my meticulous financial record keeping.  In all the years I've been using the software, I've never had a problem with numbers except due to an error on my part.  Then I purchased Quicken 2013.  Tonight was the second time that I've had to revert to a backup copy of my data due to a sync with their \\""cloud\\"" service causing my numbers to change.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the terror that this instills within me (and you I hope), I watched as my checking account total changed by over $10.  This total changed after a sync only with the mobile service (I performed a sync with my financial institutions individually and separately from the mobile sync).  I looked at my screen dumbfounded with how I gained $10 when I made NO changes via the mobile app on my iPhone.  I looked through all of the cleared transactions, but I couldn't find anything that had changed.  I don't even use the app to enter transactions, all I wanted was a snapshot of the data from my desktop.  I work in Quicken everyday, so before I leave for the day I have all the latest data for my accounts and budgets on my desktop.  I take that data on my phone, use it as a guide during the day, then update it on my PC that evening.  Somehow, this resulted in a $10 discrepancy.  Also note that as I stated above, this is the second time this happened since I bought Quicken 2013 on 10/05/12.<br /><br />I have nothing to say regarding any other aspect of Quicken 2013.  I upgraded solely to have the mobile app and that is broken to the point of uselessness.  Just before starting this review, I went into Quicken and deleted my \\""cloud\\"" data.  I also deleted the app from my iPhone.  This \\""feature\\"" is a threat to your finances.  When I purchased the software, they were at Release 1.  In just a few weeks, they are up to Release 5.  I would venture a guess that we are in the QA phase of development.  Most businesses pay workers to perform QA on their software.  With Intuit, you pay them to QA their software.<br /><br />------ Update:  12/06/12 ------<br /><br />Mark and Christopher, I'm glad you both found the review useful.  Christopher, in response to your question about a replacement for Quicken, the first thought that came to my mind was \\""Quicken 2011\\"".  After thinking about it for a bit, I realize my decision was based on the feeling that 2011 gave me the most value for my money.  I purchased 2011 similar to 2013, very shortly after it was released.  I don't recall having any issues with the software.  Without going off on a tangent, I think the fair thing for me to do is to take into consideration the other aspects of the Quicken 2013 software.<br /><br />The budgeting aspect changed a bit from previous versions.  I'm still acclimating to that, but it seems more flexible and this could potentially be more useful to people.  Other than that aspect and the mobile features, just about everything in 2013 is functioning the same way the 2011 did.  This is a good thing in my mind, as I mentioned above I was very satisfied with Quicken 2011.<br /><br />Having made that statement, I think it's reasonable to say that if this is the first version of Quicken you are purchasing, then you are getting the same software from the previous versions and that is good.  If you are upgrading for the cloud features, my advice is to hold off a little while longer on that.  On 11/30 another patch was released which noted a few more fixes for some bugs in the Quicken Cloud aspect of the software.  I still don't think that feature is ready for prime-time.<br /><br />As for an alternative software package, perhaps something that is very \\""cloud ready\\"", you could take a look at mint.com.  I've never used it personally but I've seen several blogs rave about it.  I've never felt the desire to go to mint as I believed that the features would be available in Quicken before long.  Mint is owned by Intuit, so that proves Intuit is familiar with and capable of doing cloud based money management well.  My hope is that any more steps that Intuit takes in the direction of the cloud will be a bit more refined prior to releasing to the public.<br /><br />I've also decided to increase my rating to two stars.  Should the mobile feature reach bullet-proof levels, I'll increase my rating to three stars.  As it stands, I still don't see where I've gotten my money's worth out of the $60 upgrade and based on the hassles with the bugs in the mobile feature, I don't see any way that Quicken 2013 could attain higher than 3 stars in my mind."
0,The Code number that you give is invalid. Adobe still wants you to verify with them and takes 24 hours.. This is not good at all!<br /><br />Your better off buying through Adobe themselves.. Adobe says they don't guarantee third party sellers!
0,I wish they had been more honest about the changes being made.  I feel ripped off.
0,"I wish I'd of waited a while longer and let other people waste their money on this product.  I was happy to have a new tool to automate my budgeting but this thing is a joke.  At least once a month I have to go in and re-adjust my opening balance because my online balance and my Quicken balance don't match.  I've gone through and looked, there are no missing transactions, the program is unable to do math.<br /><br />I'm military, I live overseas, the mobile tool?  yeah it'd be great it I could use it.  Not until I get back to the states, thanks for that too.  Super helpful for me.<br /><br />This program is a piece of garbage, I'd go to Mint.com but its owned by the same company so I guess its back to Excel spreadsheets and manually keeping up with this stuff.  Why can't Microsoft start making MS Money again?  That software was awesome."
0,"Rip off, because they removed Sched D and forced you to pay for next level"
0,I bought the wrong version
1,Very Useful<br />This is a very useful anti-virus program. When combined with a good firewall I have had no virus issues since I have had avast!<br />I would recommend it to any casual user of the internet.
1,"Was able to download the product, install it and update the software without any problem, took about 20 minutes start to finish. Would do it again in a heartbeat. I can't comment yet on 2008 TaxCut because I haven't done my taxes yet but I've been using TaxCut for a few years and it works well for me. I did use TurboTax before, since the early 80's but they got weird the past few years with their practices so I switched and never looked back."
1,The Organizer updates seem to be quite good and the Quick fix options work quite well.  I have to spend a lot of quality time with the software to tell you more.
0,"I have liked previous editions better. I didn't like that you couldn't see what parts of the forms were filled in as you were completing the forms (felt kind of in the dark). As a matter of fact, you don't see your forms until everything is completed. Because of the way your forms are saved, in PDF files, couldn't access and interface last year's info. Probably will look into something else next tax season."
1,"As manny of the other reviews stated Quicken forced me to upgrade from my earlier version.  I read all the horror stories in the other reviews and was not looking forward to the upgrade.  However it upgraded smoothly and I did not have any of the major problems that the other reviews mentioned.  This may have been since I never used all the features of the older version so the there was less items thed needed to be converted or Intuit fixed the other problems.  My only issues is the normal upgrade problem of having to search around to find where they moved items and I have noticedd that the new version is a little slower in recording new entries, but nothing that is significant."
0,"I've never given a product 1 star in a review.  If zero stars were an option, that would be my choice.  Other, virtually unanimous, negative reviews represent my frustrations well.  Going to the subscription service only model was a slap in the face of those of us who have used Adobe products legally for years.  This is compounded by Adobe's incredibly ham fisted and arrogant implementation.  I'm actively looking at alternatives."
1,I have used the free version of avast! for several years and it does what it claims -- protects my computer from virus attacks.  My son who is a computer tech highly recommends avast!.
1,Turbo Tax is a great and reliable software program year after year - I have been using it since 2001.
1,I always jasper sky Internet security every year! Love the product! Doesn't let anything by unless told to!
0,"Very easy to use though many of the questions were redundant and confusing. Not everything carries through. It has different files i.e.: your will, your living will, your advance directive, your durable power for finance, your durable power for medical decisions.<br />They didn't plug into each other and I was afraid I was changing my answer between the different files.<br />I hope my kids can figure it all out."
1,Any body who speaks English can do tax using Turbo Tax Softwar. All you have to do is Aswer the questions.
0,I like Microsoft word better even though it tends to be more expensive.  WordPerfect does crash unexpectedly on 8.1.  One of the things I found cheap by Corel is the dictionary.  The one in this is small.  It cost $24.99 to get the full version which they claim is 52% bigger.  The dictionary in X7 Home & Student is about worthless.  I have always found Microsoft dictionaries quite adequate.  It does the job but for this you might as well use with open office...its free.
0,I rated this with one star for one simple reason. I have no recollection of purchasing this product. I do not know how it was registered in my account.
1,The same Norton Internet Security as always and gets better with every update. I would recommend it for everyone who needs an antivirus.
0,"Like so many other reviewers, I am a long-time user of Turbo Tax. I used the Deluxe version. Nothing complicated about my personal income situation and I have a small side business. Deluxe always did a great job. Last year I paid $30 at Costco. I'll be using H&R Block Deluxe this year. Reviews look good and it's about what I paid last year. I guess Intuit never heard of gradual price increases. Wham! I would now need the Home and Business version which runs about $78. That's $48 more than last year or a 160% increase over what I paid last year. That sort of increase is only welcome in a pay raise or portfolio gain.<br /><br />Intuit is offering a $15 dollar discount down to $63 if we buy by Jan 31. They also promise a $25 rebate after I file this year, since I used Deluxe last year. No thanks. It's the principle. Next year it will cost me the full $75 or so. Might as well get used to H&R Block software. Too bad: TurboTax was a very nice product, but run by poor decision makers."
1,I like it.*
1,"This new Quicken was easy to load, moved my data from the previous version without loss.  I was able to use it immediately.  Only changes that immediately were noticed, the update tool is moved, but that was not a problem."
1,"I have tried several recipe organizers and this one is the best.  There have been a couple of glitches, but the staff is extremely responsive and answer the same day.  They are also always updating their editions to fix problems.  Entering recipes is a pain, but it is going to be so.  I have collected cut-out recipes for 25 years and pasted them into 2 large books.  I tried the scanning method to enter them, but that is nearly as time-consuming as entering them by hand...  I have made changes over the years or I like to give different instructions than those written.  So it took me several weeks to enter my 400+ recipes.  I now have a copy of the program on my Envy tablet-PC (couldn't easily find this, so the help desk at DVO sent me a link) and also the app on my android phone.  It is super handy to be able to look up the ingredients of a certain recipe right on my phone while at the grocery or just at home making up menus.  It is also easy to read from the tablet or phone while preparing the recipes in the kitchen.  I have not had problems w/ the app crashing, except at first on my husband's IPad.  It eventually worked, and no problems since.  The main difficulty is syncing between all of those devices when I add new recipes.  It can be done.  I have found I need to close the desktop version so that it saves and backs up.  Then I close all of my apps on other devices.  Then open the desktop and press the cloud-shaped sync button.  Then open each app and press the sync.  After all that, the recipes are all in the same places.  But considering I don't intend to enter a bunch of new recipes in the future, this is not a bad procedure.  I have tried the menu planning and grocery list process.  The instructions online are quite confusing.  But once it gets going, this is a very handy feature.  I have been writing menus and grocery lists by hand for years, so this will be helpful.  The only complaint is that the 'pantry' items like spices are listed on the grocery list....  It would be super handy if you could mark off things you have on hand so that they would not appear in the list.  My other suggestion would be that when entering recipes that some common instructions would somehow be available as drop-downs or something.  I had to type 'minced' 'chopped' 'softened' so many times that it drove me crazy.  Overall, it is a great product.  It is worth the investment of time and money.  If you have problems, contact the DVO people; they are great!"
1,As advertised.
0,I was on site at a client of mine and tried to purchase to perform an install.  I waited for the download email and could wait no more.  I had to return to the client site at another time to complete the install.  Very inconvenient and costly to me and my client.  Streamlining the purchase with technology would help.  This is a software company and it is digital delivery after all.
0,"I have many friends in the entertainment business who are singers and DJ's, who use this type of software to create backing tracks and sound mixes. I have used their software to create sound mixes myself. Compared to their professional software this package is amateurish and has some glitches.<br /><br />The software is easy to install, but once working it becomes apparent that the package offers nothing more than software for beginners. It does has not have any resemblance in functionality to the more professional packages used by my friends. What I thinks this software offers is a package for those wishing to mix ITune music for things like YouTube videos. Simply put, this software is OK for beginners. If you are looking for a professional package to be used for DJ work or for creating backing tracks for singers, then buy something else.<br /><br />Not recommended for Professionals but OK for beginners."
1,"Easy to download, didn't have to wait for software. Works on 3 computers for one price. Will buy from again, next year."
1,This product is awesome. PC runs much faster than McAfee. Has a 30 day trial refund policy.
1,"Let me first admit that I have a prejudice for locally installed software. I use a ton of cloud-based solutions but overwhelmingly find a locally installed solution beats the cloud. Quicken Deluxe 2013 proves that.<br /><br />I've tried the cloud solutions (Mint, etc.) and Quicken blows them away. It looks like people who have been Quicken users for a long time have a few concerns. I'm late to the personal finance software party, but as a set of fresh eyes on the subject can recommend it completely. I've never been so in control of my finances. My experience shows that the developers have presented a solution that with a minimum of effort can get anyone in control of their family budget quickly.<br /><br />My stress levels are way down in this area. Good job Quicken."
0,Awful product
1,Fast easy to understand. Quick refund. Use in conjunction with Quicken for even easier data entry.
0,so far...severe malfunctions.....been locked out for a week....missed a credit card payment.....chatted with support twice and no solution in sight.
1,"Worked fine for me, Windows XP, Firefox 3.5.7, only pita was the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 upgrade. Best to just do this before you are ready to go to bed!"
0,"AMAZON only tells that  TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011 for PC [Download]  by Intuit  Platform: Windows Vista / 7 / XP  As a matter of fact, XP has 32-bit & 64-bit Pro versions. I bought, downloaded and tried to install it on my XP 64b-pro system, TurboTax simply refused to be installed. I checked with [...], then know that    \\""Please note that per the TurboTax 2011 system requirements , we do not support the Windows XP 64-bit operating system for the CD/Download software.\\""  Now I just hope I could get my money back from AMAZON."
1,"It took me no more than 2 minutes to enter my product key into my Norton NIS. Was down to 2 days left. No need to un/reinstall anything. Last year did same with the 2013 NIS. Whenever a new version comes out you can upgrade your existing NIS to the new version, free!! Click support then click check for new version. Wally World wants over 3X what I paid on Amazon. Next year I will do the same!!"
0,3 to 4 years ago it was a better protect . easy to use with more information.
0,Unfortunately its not very user friendly and is probably better for interior design than anything.
1,"Almost free, works great, love it, easy instructions.<br />Good price, easy installation, all good and great.<br />Have a nice day."
1,T an easy to do program and security is great. It makes me feel safe and secure. I never have to worry.
1,Good
0,"The Amazon down-loader worked fine; the software was successfully downloaded/saved?, With the help of Angel in Digital Services,it was proven<br /> that the software would download successfully.However, the software application would not open. Please ask the provider to fix this problem?<br />Please see Angel for details?"
1,"Installation went smoothly.<br />After replacing HDD to SSD I was forced to reenter installation key and got different product ID, thus probably consuming second install from family pack.<br />Fortunately, the HDD (with Office installed on it) went as an upgrade to my daughter's Macbook, and Office applications were recognised without additional registration."
1,ive been using this for years and i would never switch to anything else! i have never had a problem with it and it is so user friendly!
1,I used it for of my computers and works great .  I recommended the software to friends and family.  hank You
1,Avast has worked very well for me. A computer technician recommended it and put it on for me. I would recommended it to everyone.
1,I love it
1,Had some trouble getting this activated and didn't get it solved for some time. But it's up and working now and I'm hoping to quickly learn how to use it.
1,"The software is easy to use, and although it will not duplicate the effects from the movie gravity it is still a good software for personal use. Very pleased with this and believe that you would be as well."
1,"I previously used spreadsheets and Mint to handle budgets and account balances. I am very happy with the Quicken Deluxe 2015 PC software. It was easy to download, install, and the setup was fairly intuitive.  Figuring out the budgeting system and loan took a little more time but I had an accurate snapshot of my checking account quickly.  The software does not connect to my Wells Fargo 401k account automatically.  I suspect that may be an issue on the Wells Fargo side though.  It tracks loan balances and asset amounts based on linked payments and is excellent at letting me know where my money is going.<br />I am not at all impressed with the Android companion software for Quicken 2015.  It is very lacking in features and the most important part - knowing how much money you have left after all bills are paid - is not available.  It just shows you how much is in your bank account at the moment.  If I wanted to view that I would use my bank's application. In order to see how much money you have left you will need to login to the computer that has Quicken loaded.  Definitely a disappointment. My husband would be more involved in the budgeting system if the Android companion app was better. Would be nice to have an accurate ending balance on the phone and the ability to take a snapshot of a receipt, tag it and assign it to an account rather than having to login to the PC to make individual entries later."
0,"The Federal Version is relatively easy to navigate. However, making sense of the state version was impossible, due to the very poor state of documentation and explanation. Cryptic, complex, expensive and non-functional, at the state level. Why do they even make that an option, and an additional expensive one, at that, given the muddled, ambiguous, error-prone, sloppy and poorly designed nature of navigating a state return? NOT RECOMMENDED FOR STATE RETURNS."
1,A very simple bookkeeping program. Annual report for your CPA gets your tax refund much quicker. Allows check posting and electronic bill paying.
1,"My graphics needs are modest.  A little web stuff or Keynote stuff here, a little video editing there.  I don't have the time, the money or the patience to deal with the over-priced professional grade big brother of the 'Elements' software line.  That stuff can run hundreds of dollars, and it includes a bunch of features I'd never use.<br /><br />All that said, there are a few quirks of this software that will remind you from time to time that you are only using the kiddie version of the pro line.  But often times there are workarounds even for those situations.<br /><br />If you are just starting out in graphics or video editing, there's plenty here to get you on your way.  In fact it could literally take a few years for the average self taught person to become expert at using this product.  And here's the good news.  The skills you learn using Photoshop Elements and Premiere, can be transferred to the full pro version if you ever need to take your skills to the next level.<br /><br />Given that you can usually get both programs well south of $150, I'd say that's a very fair price for the set.<br /><br />This won't be enough for the true professionals, but for the rest of us it will take you a long way for a nice low price."
1,"The 2015 version for Windows arrived when promised, installed and converted my files without a glitch. Operation is same as previous versions so I didn't have to go through a learning curve to track my entries. All in all, it's the same dependable tool (upgraded) that I've been using more than 20 years."
0,"I purchased Connectify Pro and can't get it to work. I have sent numerous emails to their support, you can't call them, and generated a support ticket. I even ask for help on their Facebook page and I have been totally ignored. I now find myself having to go back to my credit card company to try and get my money back. I recommend anyone stay away from this company. Chuck"
0,"TurboTax definitely made filing my taxes easier.  My reason for 3 stars and not 4 or 5, is the hidden cost, Paid an extra $39.99 to file CA State income tax and another $19.99 to file electronically that is in addition to the $49.99, that I originally pad for the software.  The price would have been about the same as taking to H&R Block and having someone else do them."
1,"I like this version of Quicken. If you are using Quicken Essentials for Mac, you'll have no trouble picking this up. If you are using Quicken 2007 for Mac, this interface is a pretty radical departure. Be aware that it also doesn't contain all of the features of Quicken 2007. Reporting especially is pretty weak compared to 2007, although the Quicken team announced on their website that they will be adding features for free over the coming months, so hopefully more in-depth reporting is coming.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of what it does include, it works with more banks than 2007 does (the version I'm coming from). All of my checking, savings, credit card & brokerage accounts (except for one) work with the download feature. For me at least, this is an upgrade from 2007, where a couple of banks had stopped supporting that version of Quicken.<br /><br />The other big feature it includes is mobile syncing. I can enter transaction on my iPad or iPhone (theres an android version as well) and they sync up with the correct account. This is the big deal for me. I hate going away for a weekend and coming home with a pocketful of receipts to enter. With 2015, I can enter them as I get them. If you don't use that feature, this upgrade might not be worth it for you.<br /><br />It's definitely not a feature for feature replacement for Quicken Mac 2007, although it is leaps and bounds better than Essentials. I don't have any direct knowledge of the Windows product, but I'm assuming this would not be a replacement for that program yet either."
1,"I purchased iBank 5 about 2 months ago, initially as a trial version from the company's website.  After using Quicken on a PC for years, I can say that iBank is first class!  iBank is reliable, has minimal problems connection with your bank and credit cards, and has good reports and budgeting.  In addition, the iPad app works well with desktop iBank AS LONG AS you occasionally do the wifi sync between desktop and iPad.  As a footnote, though, I'd comment that this software is a little pricey ($60 for desktop, another $20 or so for iPad).  In addition, there's a free iPhone iBank app - but it's not particularly useful.<br /><br />I suspect this is the best home finance product for Mac's these days!"
1,"Easy to use.  Cleaned up some of the bugs.  However, when categorizing a split entry such as cash, the entry automatically enters the leftover amounts to the first category used instead of defaulting to uncategorized.  Like new format as well as the reports category."
0,"This years turbo tax is awful, more error messages than I have ever experienced. Illinois state forms for Part Year resident still is showing&#34;do not file&#34; form not approved. Yet Going to the state site the form is in the final form and ready for filing. Whats up tubo tax to busy counting your cash vs working on the code? Awful!!!!!"
1,love it
1,"Does NOT slow down my system like the &#34;other guys&#34; do.<br />Have not gotten an infection since starting to use Avast.<br />Tempting to upgrade to the &#34;Full Version&#34;, but I'm a cheapskate!"
0,I did a comparison test and it is my opinion that Turbo Tax is somewhat more detailed and it did give me a larger refund.
1,I have been using this product for years and will continue to use it for years to come. The ease of downloading it from Amazon Dot Com and the discount that TurboTax gave on the download were added bonuses.
1,I bought TurboTax at Sams.
0,Costs too much and probably won't use it again.
1,Unbelievable price and necessary for safe surfing.  Try buying this from Norton or in a retail store and you will appreciate it's low price at amazon.
1,"It has been couple of months past the expiration of my Kaspersky license.  Honestly, I was waiting for a good deal until I was about to give up and go for a similar solution by Norton.  Fortunately, I notice that Amazon had the Kaspersky license under $40 (about the same price as Norton's) so I got my new Kaspersky license right away.<br /><br />I already have the previous version of Kaspersky (2014) installed on a Dell Notebook and a MacBook Pro.  I didn't bother downloading the latest software for either, but instead I tried the activation code directly.  Using the code in the Dell Notebook went flawlessly.  However, It didn't got so well with the MacBook Pro.<br /><br />On the Mac, Kaspersky seemed to take the code, just to turn around and indicate that the license was corrupted.  I tried deleting the  license, which worked with my older license, but the tool didn't want to remove the new one.  I closed and opened the tool, and the license was removed.  Adding the new license went without troubles the second time and seemed to activate OK.  However, it still didn't add the MacBook Pro under the listing of devices in my account at My Kaspersky.  The Dell Notebook was added without any issues.<br /><br />I may try to update my Safari web browser to see if I can add my MacBook to the devices in My Kaspersky account.  However, updating Kapersky Internet Security for Mac is not an option as the last version supporting my configuration is 2014.  Not a bad version as it is still superior than the one offered by Norton for my aging Mac."
1,Well had a few weeks now and it works a dream. Now I can save my works and send them to friiends who might have problems with their computer or software. Just by doing a simple problem solving demo and saving it to most formats. Still looking at other things for use. Also the price is right and much cheaper than camtasia with the bells and whistles.  Easy to use. Works in Windows 8<br /><br />Kenyon Davies
1,Most excellent and easy to use software. Makes filing my taxes a breeze.
1,BY far the easiest tax prep program and thoroughly asks you all questions that even you don't think of. Have been using this program for 3 years and only gets better and easier to use as the program takes all the info from the previous year and starts you off right
0,"I am sorry to say that I am not having the same experience as the other reviewers.  I needed to update my quicken due to a computer crash.  If history repeats itself, the version of Quicken I had been running will most likely be unsupported this April, so I went ahead and purchased the new version.  This version seems to have issues with downloading statements and also the basic math of a balance.  In the download I performed, it is showing credit card charges as payments instead of charges.  If that was not enough, an actual scheduled payment on the card is increasing my balance due.  It may be time to explore a different option, since you will do just as well keeping your balances in Excel."
1,Used them for years.  All good.
1,Easy to download
0,"Like many others, I have been using Turbo Tax for a long long time.  Overall have been pleased with it but I'm not going to pay the pricing that Intuit put into place this year to do investments.  Even with my Amazon Prime membership Turbo Tax was twice as much as I just paid for H&R Block with a 25% discount offer.  I downloaded H&R Block and all has been going well so far.  My taxes are not that complex so no reason to pay so much for something that was much cheaper last year.  I never would have thought of going with H&R Block but Intuit gave me reason to pause and take a chance on another product for less money.  So far I'm happy with my decision and unless Intuit finds a way to win me back or H&R Block gives me reason to leave after one year, I will give H&R Block another try next year."
0,The forms did not transfer well from Turbo Tax. Had a hard time finding certain forms. Also I added $20 to get premier because state filing was free. It still charged me $19 to efile with the state?! Why is that? Now I have to call back and see if I can get that fee reversed. Not as easy as everyone said.
1,It has been doing a great job.
1,"The Vegas Pro Suite is great! I have been using the Sony Editing suites for a while and they have been great. My only gripe is that the application will tend to crash a lot especially when editing a lot of tracks. I have to remember to save after applying media / video FX. There may be some compatibility issues with NewBlueFX 3 as the application crashes sometimes when applying some titling. As there are so many factors that can contribute to an application crashing, I still give it 5 stars because editing using this suite is very easy to use and learn and the quality of the finished product is always great!"
1,I've used Kaspersky for many years now without incident. This was an excellent deal!
1,fast does most of typing if you used it before.fast and accurate refunds.
0,"I was disappointed, each year Turbo Tax seems to be geeting less effective, my state, Virginia , as an example was very difficult to use."
0,"This program didn't work with any of our accounts, so it was pretty much useless."
0,The product has changed from previous years and doesn't have all of the old schedules and charges an up fee to download them.
1,"My brother told me at the last minute that he didn't file his taxes.  I needed an affordable fix, and found it with the 2011 digital version of the H&R Block tax software.  I was able to download the software (easy to follow download instructions), complete his taxes and e-file. Amazon's price was the best."
1,"Okay...not the girl off the commercial, but Awsomesauce!  This is by far the best antivirus on the market.  Stay with the free version though...the internet security version isn't much better than the Norton and McAfee Internet security versions."
1,Best free av tool ever. Really works and protect your computer and tab or smart. A must have!!!
1,Microsoft office for Mac works perfectly and has no problems and very easy to install. The best part was that it was a lot cheaper than buying it off of the Microsoft office website.
1,Excellent antivirus.
1,"Love the new Norton!  It comes with a lot of extras that really helped the performance of my computer.  I've used Norton for about 6 years now, and wouldn't think of anything else."
1,"Would have given a 5/5 but it's not available on Mac platform. Besides that it worked as promised! Time to add apple to your supported OS, Intuit"
0,"I used turbo tax for about 4-5 years now, very easy and very fast with no problems.  This year, My charge card was charged 3 time for the federal filing, my back statement showed them as pending.  when I called support, I was connected to an Indian or Pakastani that I hardly understood and I had problems trying to conview my concern too about my card.  after about 30 mins plus of trying to communicate with him, I was finally convinced that that happens alot and that it was not a problem."
1,I have used Turbo Tax Home & Business for 3 years now.  I have to say that this years addition has been the easiest one I have used yet.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to file a combined home and business return.
1,"Great item for the price can not go wrong , I will recommend this item to any one who needs it"
1,"I have been using Quicken Deluxe for at least 15 years now.  I don't upgrade every year, but I did this year.  I must say I really love the 2013 version.  To me it is much more user friendly, and I love all the cool things I can do with it.  I make my kids use Quicken to keep track of their spending and to teach them how to managed their finances.  Keep up the good work Quicken!"
1,After five years QUicken 2006 suddenly stopped working and there were no updates available or support to get it working again.  So I was forced to upgrade to Quicken 2013 and had to have the deluxe version in order to read my Quicken 2006 data.  Installation was straightforward and my data loaded without any problem.  New version seems very similar to 2006 version with the addition of more on-line account uploading capability which may be useful for credit card bills but not essential.
0,Haven't been able to use it yet.  Constantly getting error &#34;4118  We're unable to communicate with the server right now.  Please try again later&#34;<br />7 days of trying later!  Argh!
0,"Purchased as an upgrade to the wimpy and incredibly dumbed-down Quicken Essentials for Mac. It was not an upgrade. This program is virtually identical to Essentials, except that it is supposed to keep track of investments. Unfortunately, it does this improperly, so the graphs and figures it presents are useless. This program can't decide whether I'm a millionaire or a broke 26 year old living in my parent's basement. It did determine that I'm an idiot, after spending $50 on this piece of garbage."
1,always use for my two businesses
0,It is in German language and I'm unable to change it
0,My biggest issue was with Amazon's download software - it simply will not work on my PC with XP-64. Just keeps on crashing during installation saying it need admin rights while I am logged in as admin.     The tax software is OK but it imported by data from last year with my with mistakes. I couldn't figure it out until I started reviewing. I also saw inconsistent Federal Tax total. - I added a tax deduction to test how much that will lower my taxes and later removed the deduction but the Federal calculation did not return to the previous value. This was a big surprise to me - fortunately I saved a copy before making changes so I was able to return to the saved copy and the calculation can back - strange.     Overall I rate this OK - and the questions adequate to do the taxes. The State download was named BETA which dosnt give too much confidence even the final version updated 4/8/2010 still says BETA. Its hard to find a better software in my mind - this year all the software's seam to have some kind of issues.
0,"Generally speaking I have been quite satisfied with my standard Avast protection for the last couple of years, so I thought that signing up for Grimefighter  would only serve to enhance my system. However, how wrong I was. Having used it for two months now, I can honestly say that I found no discernable improvement to performance. I am very disappointed and wished that I had saved my money."
0,I would ask for my money back if I thought it would help. I would load Norton from the website.  It would work fine for a day or so. Then it gives the error messages and won' work. I go to Norton site and try their Eraser and Uninstaller and go through the entire process again...ditto. I tryed to download from a Norton site...same results. I took off all other software with firewalls such as Malwarebytes...same results. I finally said the heck with it and downloaded a free virus software.
1,Fine
0,"Every year I go through the dance to decide which tax prep package to buy. I've alternated between TurboTax and H&R Block for many, many years. This year, H&R Block clearly is the loser. Well, maybe I'm actually the loser. I have a fairly straight-forward clergy housing allowance and this software just couldn't handle it correctly. I fought it for hours to no avail. Frustrated, I decided to pick up TurboTax Deluxe and within 30 minutes - including download and install time - I had completed my return correctly. The details of the situation are too fine to describe here, just suffice it to say that if you need to anything but the simplest clergy housing allowance, this is NOT your software. Oh, and because of the difficulty the software had with my return, even if I wanted to it wouldn't let me e-file. TurboTax e-filed just fine, thank you very much. I know Amazon's T&Cs of sale prohibit returning software downloads, but it just stinks to be stuck with software that's clearly broken and useless to me. Next year I'm heading directly to TurboTax!"
1,"Have been using turbo tax for several years and have been satisfied with the product, it is not perfect but it is very good tax software."
0,"In total honesty I'm running into operator issues with this player.  If someone out there knows the in's and out's, and likes all the bells and whistles of this player, plez pass them on to me or Amazon.  I'm sure it's just me and my lack of catching on to new technology."
1,- will do 95% of what most users need for a lot less than the full Photoshop and Premiere programs.
0,Tried the Bigasoft Total Video Converter Trial from their website and it worked well.  Found it on Amazon and purchased the software.<br /><br />Purchased the software and downloaded it from Amazon's digital library.  The downloaded version purchased was version 3.7.49.5044 (an older version).  The audio and the video did NOT SYCH.  The mouthing of the conversation did not match the audio.<br /><br />Went online to the Bigasoft to check for their support and it said to check if it was the latest version.  The version sold on Bigasoft has a newer version 4.2.2.5198 and it looks totally different (coloring).  Downloaded the newer version/installed and now both the new and old software does not work at all.  Tried to uninstalled the older version and by going to Control Panel / uninstall software and it was not listed.<br /><br />Called Amazon and they said I needed to check with Bigasoft.  Contacted Bigasoft and they said they did not sell license codes to Amazon.  Returned to Amazon and they corrected the problem.
1,I have been using this software every year and have not been disappointed. Very easy to use and helps you along the way when you need it.<br />Highly recommend.
0,"I agree with other reviewers that forcing me to update didn't sit well, but let's face it - there aren't too many programs that you can use forever.<br />After reading all the negative reviews, I did look into other programs, but it seemed like going to Quicken 2013 would be the smoothest transition, and - theoretically - the quickest.  This version is pretty much the same as 2010 so far.  I wasn't too happy when I spent an hour putting information in only to have it tell me that it closed unexpectedly and I might lose all the data.  When I re-opened it, everything was there, though, so that was a needless worry.  I'd say it's as good as any other programs, and Amazon's price can't be beat!"
0,"This software suffers from a serious lack of what IT people call the &#34;give a s***&#34; factor.  Only someone over 40 years old would appreciate the unintuitive (pun intended) interface and displays.  Colors and easy to read text, please!  I used mint so I figured Quicken would be at least as logically laid out... sadly no.  It was old looking, confusing and boring.  You can tell in about 5 minutes that the program was written for an older generation who are too afraid to get off quicken because they're so deeply invested in years of data files and accounting.<br /><br />Next, account access was lacking.  Seriously, when the for-free mint.com (another Intuit product)  can sync with investments that Quicken cannot, what does that tell you about Intuit?  Maybe telecommuters from the two development departments should come to work and share with each other.  Yahooooooo!"

1,Great product. Amazon just made it a very seamless process when I had to upgrade. No need to go to the store to buy the box.
1,easy to use
1,"I had a tech-savvy co-worker recommend Avast to me a few years ago, and have been using it ever since.  It's great!!"
1,Great price. Helped me do my taxes all by myself. Showed me my errors the next day pretty much and then I fixed it and got my refund fast. Highly recommended
1,Installation was very easy. Imported old files with out any issues. Lots of new features over the Quicken deluxe it replaces.
1,I upgraded from 2010 about a week ago.  Mainly to be able to keep downloading financial activity.  I've had no issues with the upgrade and all my data moved over fine.
1,"Panda free Antivirus 2015 really made me very angry because after I have downloaded the program, they said that It was an error and they redirected me to another program and asked for money .I think they were devious and not honest with the consumers.I have downloaded 3 times and it turned out the same result."
1,"Product works great.  Some hiccups in Amazon's downloading system, and not a very good system in place to let us know what the problem was."
0,"I signed up for a 90-day free trial of Microsoft Office 365.  Before it expired, they sent me an email with an opportunity to buy a subscriptions. I paid $150 for a year.  I got an email today saying that my 90-day trial period ends in 7 days and all my data will be lost if I don't subscribe this week.  I double checked my credit card bill to make sure I had been charged - I had.  I spent about 15 minutes on their website to find a phone number.  I have been on hold for 30 minutes now (still waiting - this is how I will spend that time efficiently).  It took me three days to put all my data onto Office 365.  I did everything as instructed.  Now I have to worry that they will delete everything because of a billing error on their end?<br /><br />Wishing I had used a different service but stuck with it now, I guess.  This is a bad start to our relationship.  I should be working, not dealing with this nonsense."
0,"A Trend Micro protection program is included my wireless Cisco Router.  Most of the time there is no problam; however, I have a paid investment service that Trend Micro has deemed unsafe, and so far no amount of requested reclassification will remove the block.  I will avoid Trend Micro in the future."
1,I've been using Norton for a long time and this is by far the best deal I've received on this product. The renewal process was very easy and this time I did not have to uninstall the old product to install this one. Awesome!!!
1,"If Windows 8 makes you use swear words, Start8 is an easy and complete fix.  It restores that start button which, I promise, you'll never take for granted ever again."
1,"WORKS WELL WITH MAC, HAVE USED THE 360 FOR SEVERAL YEARS LOVE IT, Norton is trustworthy and i would recommend to my friends."
1,I have had great success with avast! antivirus.  I have installed it on our church computers as well as that of many of our friends.  IT WORKS!!!!!
1,Would never use another program
1,"Great anti-virus and it's free! Safe and secure and available for PC, tablets and phone! It has never let me down!"
1,"I have been using the free version for years and have never had a virus. It doesn't seem to use as much processing resources as some of the competitors. Every time I boot my computer, it updates the virus definitions so it is always up to date."
1,hard to find a deal like this
1,"The Step by Step guide to filing your taxes is very easy, & customer support helps you. If you work in multiple states it will get expensive. I bought the Basic version & the fee for me is $40 per state. I may look into H&R Block software next year."
0,"Product Support Sucks!<br /><br />I got the first Quicken or Mac when if first came out.  How does a company fail to understand &#34;customer support.&#34; I would gladly pay money for support. Instead I have spent hours with individual who can not help. Management should be ashamed of themselves. I purchased the upgrades for Mac 2007 and now it's broken and I dreaded the need to get help. I would pay $50 in a heartbeat to talk to a real person, to get this back up and running. As it sits now I'm have to miss work tomorrow and hope someone calls me. Sorta like that other company you will love to fire, Comcast or Microsoft. Apple is slipping but you still can get a live, English speaking person in less than ten minutes. I hate quicken! The only thing I could imagine hating more is moving all my data to another poorly supported program."
0,There's a new format to check book register in program --- prefer how it was in earlier additions.  &#34;Find&#34; feature is now easier to use.  Also like easier back up file identification.  Everything else seems comparable to older edition we had been using.
1,Work's Great. There is no cross over issues and all functions work that I have tried. I love the ability to work on any excel sheet on my mac.
1,It was very fast and simple to understand. Better than going to the store trying to find it.Also the price is right.
1,This was my first time ever downloading anything like this; but it really helps. When I turn on my computer and if any virus' are there it will let me know that it have taken care of the problem and have fixed anything that needed fixing. I wish I would have done this before. Anyone who is thinking about getting this; I would say go for it. Just make sure that it is new that you are downloading; because I have gotten software before that had been used and it did not work. But this is a good investment for anyone who uses computers and are not experts.
1,The Merchant Center and The ability to sort Items by name instead of just item number is a big plus and is worth the price of the Application
0,"I like Quicken 2011 better than 2010.  That said, I can't really endorse this product even though I continuue to use it.  I had trouble applying updates to the downloaded version and had to call Intuit.   I also did not realize this is Deluxe and had to upgrade to Premium which cost another 30 bucks.  I could not find where to apply that update and I had to call Quicken.  All in all, I miss my MS Money and in general can't stand Intuit.  If I had a better choice I would use something else.  The odd thing is I used to use Quicken back in 2000-2003 timeframe and loved the product. Then Intuit did the silly activation thing on Turbo-Tax and so I moved on.  I am happy with TaxCut (now H&R Block) over Intuit's TurboTax (disclaimer I have not used TurboTax for 5-6 years).  Over the years I have spent hundreds of dollar with Intuit, registered every copy and have never gotten a break on any upgrades etc.  I will say their Tech Support is good but I prefer products that do not need support.  (BTW - Their knowledge base fixes nothing)  The web site where you can upload your portolios is pretty weak sauce.  Enjoy?"
1,"Ok I don't write many reviews but this one needs one...<br /><br />This program has been completely misunderstood. What Microsoft has done with office is revolutionary! Yes there is only one usage. However, this one usage sticks with you through any computer you own. What they have done is create a way for you to actually sign in to Microsoft word and use it on any computer you own! I only found this out by accident. I was using an big clunky desktop. I downloaded it despite the negative reviews, because I needed it for school. Recently I decided to retire my clunker and get a laptop. I was dreading having to buy Microsoft Office all over again. I clicked on the trial icon on my new laptop for kicks and it gave me an option to input a key or sign in. I decided to try signing in. Lo and behold Microsoft office downloaded right to my new computer! I want everyone to know this because I don't think it is widely known, hence the low ratings about one usage. It is also connected to your Sky Drive so you can store all of your documents in the cloud and access them from anywhere. There new design is fun and hip. There are many hundreds of premade formats for an array of different projects. They are so fun and helpful. I love this new Microsoft office and can't say enough good things about it!<br /><br />Edit- Reading through previous reviews specifically the top rated lowest rating. I found that this is a recent change for Microsoft as of April 2013. They replied to this rating to say they have made office transferable. So check it out everyone and re-review your review :) They are listening to their customers which is more than a lot of companies can say!"
1,I did my taxes first on H&R Block this year and was very disappointed in how it handled foreign taxes and rental properties.  I redid my taxes on Turbo Tax and it was a breeze.  It also saved me $900 more in taxes than H&R's program.
1,Envelope printer is an easy way to configure and save addressed envelopes.it has several Fonts and envelope sizes to choose from and very easy to use.
0,"I recently upgraded from premier 2013 to 2014.  Bought directly from Intuit this time for price reasons.  They shipped me a Release 1 CD!  And the current release is #5.<br />From past experience, I knew better than to try an upgrade installation first.<br />So, I installed it on a WinXP PC that had never had Quicken installed.<br /><br />The installer indicates it will do the initial install and then install updates automatically.... NOT.<br />When it started up, it had options to open an existing database or start a new one.<br />I chose to start a new one and it crashed.<br />Thereafter it crashed very soon on every startup.<br /><br />Tech support confirmed it was still Release 1 and had me download their \\""Mongo\\"" 33MB patch and install it to bring it to the latest Release 5.xxxx level.  After that it started OK although there are lots of weird screen flashes (like bad B/W TV).<br /><br />I told them no way was I going to do an upgrade for my 46MB database using software that can't even stand up on a clean installation.  They gave me a link to download the latest Release 5 full-installation file.  I did not have any known problems doing the upgrade with that.<br /><br />However, I had 3 investment accounts that I had been manually updating for years and decided I wanted to try one-step-update for them now.  I expected some misalignment problems and, sure enough, found several.  I was able to resolve all those issues for 2 of the accounts and do not blame any of those problems on Quicken.<br /><br />I always download transactions to the downloaded-transaction window where I can review them first and accept them individually or all at once or whatever. For the third account, I had quite a few discrepancies and a longer list of downloaded transactions.  It did not matter where I clicked in the window or its slider to select an item or scroll the list, it triggered Quicken to do what appeared to be the same as clicking on Accept All.  I had kept a backup of the datafile so I could try and try again as needed.  That's how I can say I tried several different ways to preview the downloaded transactions and nothing worked.  All, I could do was let it do its thing and then manually review and fix the discrepancies in the auto-merged register.  Again, I do not blame Quicken for the discrepancies.  They were all differences in the way I had entered them manually.<br /><br />BUT, that is a significant bug and I wanted to report it.  Well, lotsa luck.  Quicken support is not into even imagining the software could have bugs.  They insist on executing what I presume is a canned troubleshooting script regardless any logical path you try to lead them down AND they flat refuse to report a bug.  Not only that, but each agent is apparently \\""helping\\"" multiple customers at the same time with the result that they cannot focus on your problem and follow it logically.  They ask and re-ask the same questions and want you to try bizarre things that are way off subject.  It's like they cannot read and comprehend what you say even when you take the time to explain very comprehensively.<br /><br />I have interesting problems like, when Quicken is minimized (icon in the task bar) I can click on the icon and it does not restore the window.  I have to select the right-mouse -> restore function to make it work.  And, sometimes I click on other buttons in Quicken windows and nothing happens.  Close it out and restart it and it works again.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I have too much invested in my data files to not persevere with Quicken.<br />You just have to accept that, for a company of their size and customer base, they probably have one of the worst software development groups (although Gar*min comes close)."
1,"Had it for some 4 months, seems to work just fine. Am not sure how many viruses it stopped since I did not get any notification about encountering any, and I get an average of 100 emails daily. Does it work silently? or perhaps I actually did not get any?<br />Did find a few suspicious files when doing a scan. All considered - am very satisfied with the free version."
1,"We haven't had any problems on our computer since we've been using this product, and we've had it for a couple of years now. It updates as needed and offers upgrades, but so far we haven't wanted to spend the extra money."
0,I bought Quicken in hopes that it would be easy to use. It isn't! It does not meet my needs or expectations. I will not purchase this software again.
1,"Avast and Amazon have done well!  This is an awesome program - I purchased the added protection to go with the free download.  If you need free protection, this is the one to get!"
0,I went to file my taxes and this would not download as tried numerous times on two different computers so had to purchase a different tax program at the last minute so will never be purchasing H&R Block programs again.
1,"The subscription model does not benefit customers and simply does not make sense. Adobe is milking its customer base for what it is worth and then some. Unlike hosted storage or web email, Photoshop and Lightroom are not \\""software and a service\\"" products that must exists in the cloud. These are client side applications. The only thing that has changed is Adobe moved from perpetual licenses to subscription pricing models, effectively forcing customers to 'rent' their products by providing adobe with a monthly revenue stream and taking away the pricing option to make a single one time purchase for a perpetual license.    The only reason Adobe has been so aggressive in making this move to the subscription-based model is because their products have stagnated. There is no value proposition for customers to keep shelling out hundred of bucks at a time each every few years for new version of Photoshop/Lightroom that are at best iterative improvements and nothing like the revolutionary improvements that we saw back in the golden ages. All the low hanging fruit is gone, and we have reached a point of diminishing returns. Instead of giving customers the option to purchase single one-time perpetual licenses, Adobe is forcing everyone on the conveyor belt of lease/rent hood so that they can milk us all for as long as possible.    Photoshop hasn't had any significant improves for the past five years, and for the majority of end users any version of Photoshop  in the last decade is \\""good enough\\"", hence why the pivot from selling perpetual licenses to forcing and deep throating subscription based models on us all. Adobe is only thinking about its own corporate bottom line and not about the consumer, otherwise it would give the customer the option to continue to make single one-time perpetual license purchases, as the subscription model for a client application that is not hosted in the cloud or rendered on a web browser makes no sense whatsoever.    Vote with your wallet and justsay no. Keep using whatever version of Photoshop and Lightroom that you already have on your machine and don't give in to the serfdom.  =====  Updated below in comments."
0,"Been using Quicken for 18 years. Currently use Quicken 2015 Premiere.  For over a month now, every time I try a One Step Update, the program freezes for about 10 minutes.  The problem is confined to updating stock quotes (all my other accounts update fine when I do them individually).  This problem continues despite new version releases R6 and R7 and validating data.  Many people have written to Intuit complaining of this and nothing has been resolved.  This is unacceptable"
0,"I've used TurboTax for years and have been a fan.  No longer.  I had a small amount of Self-employment income in addition to a regular salary.  According to the IRS, TurboTax calculated the self-employment tax and transferred it to my 1040 incorrectly, resulting in a $500 difference in my refund.  If I had owed, this would have been a real problem, especially if I had filed more closely to April 15th.  I was using an online version so the file was up to date.  When I called TurboTax to let them know, they told me that I was mistaken - the IRS had not told me that my return was in error!  I recommend skipping this if you have any 1099 income."
1,I signed up for the free trial and in three hours I had three months of bank transactions accepted into the accounts for a new retail business. A few more and I had figured out how to do journal entries and I had the cash balances all in agreement. I spend just about an hour or two a month to transfer balances from our POS system to QB. Researching issues is also very easy as you can click on the amounts from a financial statement and drill down to what makes up that amount. Saves tons of time when you have a discrepancy somewhere. Love it.
0,"I just got off the phone with Turbo Tax customer support. As a long time user, I couldn't believe they would take out Schedule D functionality from a product they have sold for DECADES. Their answer might as well have been &#34;I'm sorry.....You want wheels with that bicycle? You will need to pay us double for that upgrade to our product.....&#34; I don't like change, but I'm switching to H&R Block. These guys are a piece of work, not deserving of one star."
1,I like this dictionary because I have all the words I need to check right up my hand. I give a 100 to this product.
1,"Great, however single use is a major limitation. At least 3 uses should be permitted"
1,Fast and easy way to acquire software. Less expensive than buying direct from Microsoft. Wish I was more enamored with the product.
0,"I am not seeing the benefit of this product over the cheaper version.  I wish there was a way that I could down grade to the deluxe or premier version, well live and let learn.<br /><br />For the product self,  there isn't much difference I can see between this year and last year.  I had to reactivate all my accounts which was easy but annoying.<br /><br />Frequently for whatever reason,  some accounts do not handshake with Quicken. That might be because their software doesn't mesh.<br /><br />Is it a good product, considering what is in competition, sure it is and I will use it in the future, should I live so long, but not this version, the Rental version as I am either denser than Congress or I just don't see it.  Any account can be modified to do what this version claims it does."
0,"On December 30, 2013, I downloaded Quicken Deluxe 2014 for $37.50.  The download went smoothly, but, when the program attempted to convert data from the 2011 version of Quicken Deluxe, I received an &#34;Unable to open selected file&#34; message.  I cannot access the old program, Quicken Deluxe 2011, or the new program, Quicken Deluxe 2014.  Customer support is non existent -- they tell you they are very busy, suggest a discussion group and run you in circles.  I have subtracted my payment from my credit card bill.  I will find some other way to keep track of my household finances."
1,"Was just like my header , 4th yr. in a row, tks RJ"
0,"I'm used to Photoshop, but couldn't afford it this time around. Lightroom is \\""ok\\"" but not as versitile. There's a lot of features that I could do without: such as photo album, web album, blah blah. Would like more \\""cropping\\"" options. If I could it over again, I would wait until I could afford Photoshop."
1,"If you use ANY free program, you know that they have advertizing.  You Tube, and almost any site that you access for free downloads malware programs.  These programs are so invasive that your computer slows downs.  I am a power user and I had to reload Windows 7 about every 18 months because of my computer slowing down so much.  My home desktop which is running XP was actually non functional it had so much malware on it.  I ran Malwarebytes on the desktop and it is now working fine.  Frankly I was amazed.  In the past the only fix was a reload of windows. I purchased a second laptop and actually reloaded it to make sure it was clean.  Then I attempted to download a Word to PDF converter.  Even with unchecking ALL of the adware options, I still got 5 adware programs loaded from each of two PDF converters.  I unloaded ALL of the unwanted programs including the two free PDF converters.  I noticed HEAT coming out of my laptop which was not there before.  I checked the processes and noticed that my CPU usage was much higher than before, thus the heat.  The adware was still on the computer.  I downloaded the free Malwarebytes program, installed and ran it and it found 28 Adware programs.  Bear in mind I had Microsoft Security Essentials running.  After removing the adware my CPU usage returned to near zero (I tested this both times with only task manager running) and the heat was no longer being generated from the laptop.  I ran a update of Malwarebytes one evening and a scan and found no new Adware.  The next morning after starting “The Weather Channel”  I got this audio warning adware.  I ran Malwarebytes again and it found two additional adware programs. As the reviews state, Malwarebytes is not the most effective virus blocker, but it has hands down the best removal tool. Today I upgraded my computers to the lifetime Premium for $13.99 each off of Amazon.  You cannot stop ALL viruses and adware, but Malwarebytes WILL extend the periods between when a reload is necessary. IF YOU ACCESS ANY SITE FOR FREE AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU PURCHASE ANYTHING ON LINE MALWAREBYTES IS A MUST.  If you think you do not need it, reboot your computer.  After the reboot bring up task manager (Cntl-Alt-Del) and select the performance tab.  Look at your CPU usage on both the graphs and the percentage chart.  Then download Malwarebytes install, update and run it.  See how many adware programs it finds.  It will ask you to reboot.  After the reboot bring up task manager again and select the performance tab.  You will find that the percentage of CPU usage is lower.  The adware running in the background was tying up your processor giving you less processing power for the work you want to do. GIVE THIS A TRY AND YOU WILL BE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM.  Take advantage of the $13.99 Lifetime offer.  If you use your computer you know that in time it slows down.  Adware is a HUGE problem these days.  ANYTHING YOU ACCESS FOR FREE IS NOT FREE.  THERE USUALLY IS A CATCH AND THE CATCH IS THAT ADWARE IS LOADED ON YOUR COMPUTER.  UPDATE.  Again I ran this program a day or two ago.  I wake up the computer mid day and I get this audio warning voice telling me to buy some malware product.  I run Malwarebytes and it finds probably 20 PUP files.  The thing is I had only used the net to do research.  I knew adware malware was a problem, but not even I knew that the problem was this bad.  The only thing I bring up every day is the weather channel site, which is probably where the invasion is happening.  Malwarebytes is not the most effective in stopping malware, but most sites identify it was being either the most effective or right near the best in getting rid of Malware.  I am not impressed with too many programs, but this one is fantastic.  2nd Update.  If you use Firefox activate the Adblockplus.  Doing this stopped the adware that I got from the Weather Channel site.  I notice that somehow my Adblock plus got deactivated.  I reinstalled it an have not had the adwareproblem.  As the reviews state, this program is not that good at stopping adware, but it is the best at removing it.  I have noticed that with Adblockplus in Firefox, and this program RARELY now does it even find adware on my computer.   This program is a must.  Adware is a bigger problem now than viruses.  When I first found this product and ran it my old laptop had over 1000 adware programs on it.  If you computer slows down and you have virus protection, it is probably adware that is killing your performance."
1,I've been using this software for many years & have had no problems. The only thing is that it is strictly menu driven & does not let you add info directly to a particular form

1,"QB 14 is a must have for your business.  From paying bills to receiving payments and everything in between.

1,This antivirus requires less interaction than several others that i have tried. I love it and Irecommend itto anhyone looking for a free antivirus.
0,"I was happily using my 2007 quickbooks pro and then all of a sudden I am no longer able to download my bank statements.  Why?  Because intuit is stupid.    All I can say is that intuit deserves nothing more than an entire customer group that does everything in their power to minimize intuit's profit margin and maximizes their bad press.  Each year amazon reviews contain the same fundamental issue.. That intuit does everything they can to force upgrades, charge for basic items that they lead the consumer to believe is included for free, and generally rely on the fact that no real competitor exists.    It amazes me that my distaste for microsoft in the windows 98 era is now realigned to the point that intuit makes microsoft look like apple.      In 2010 windows me still lets you use a mouse    In 2010 windows 98 still lets you email    In 2010 windows 95 still lets you connect to the internet    In 2010 office 2000 still lets you use the numbers on the top of the keyboard.    So,    Why is it that..    In 2010 quickbooks 2007 no longer emails?    In 2010 quickbooks 2007 no longer lets bank downloads go into the program?    Intuit deserves to have a competing software company receive a large amount of funding from some investors and put out a product that does a good job for a fair price, and guarantees it will never turn off your ability to do simple tasks and will entice people to upgrade because the upgraded version has better features.      That is what I call a respectable business model.   The exact opposite of intuit.    Intuit, You Suck and so does the fact that I just had to pay $180 for nothing but the ability to turn my 2007's email and download features back on."
0,Its so complicated to use. I feel I should go get another degree to help me actually use it.
1,Excellant! Nice to have an updated version. Keeps me focused and up to date on my design skills. A great buy for the student or teacher in you!
0,"Turbo tax charges $19.95 for e-filing State returns and $39.95 if you have the payment deducted from your tav refund rather than from your credit card.  If Turbo Tax was upfront and clear on these filing costs, that would be one thing, but they are not. I read the Amazon description twice and did not find any mention of the $19.95 state filing fee. Furthermore, assuming you are willing to pay the $19.95 state filing fee, they try to get another $10 ($39.95) for taking the fee out of your return. Some people may be ok with this deceptive practice, but I'm certainly not."
0,"I was very disappointed to find that I had to purchase an upgrade to complete my taxes since several major sections (Sch C for personal business and D for investments) were no longer included in this version. A refund was later offered in response to complaints, but it fell substantially short of the cost of the upgrade. Although I have used TurboTax for years, I may investigate alternatives next year."
0,"So, you have already bought TurboTax. Well, keep your wallet open. Because your not through spending money. There is fee for this and charge for that. Beware of that."
1,I would never use any other product to secure my electronics.  Easy to install and doesn't jam up computer with &#34;behind the scenes&#34; programs like other anti virus products.
1,Thank's is good
1,"I love the software and used it with my Pulse. I bought a new Sky Wi-Fi pen and had planned on getting the latest version of this software.  But the Sky pens do not use the Livescribe Desktop software. The Sky pen files are stored in Evernote and I have not figured out how this software would handle it. I loved being able to have my chicken scratchings typed out so others could read them.<br /><br />As I see it, it is not the fault of MyScript but a short sightedness of Livescribe. I would recommend MyScript to anyone with a Pulse or Echo.  If someone does know how to make this software work with the Sky, please leave a comment."

0,After using H & R for about 10 years I find that it might be time to change.  Some of the problems from the past have not been corrected and the help section directs you most of the time to the IRS instructions.  It seems also that it takes too many steps to get the help instead of having just to click on the section you are in.  You have to go search instead.
1,"Great for blocking threats and the software updates are pretty simple.  User interface is straightforward.  Over the holidays, the free version did a lot of prompting to try to get you to buy an upgrade, but generally the free version leaves you alone."

I contacted McAfee's tech support as directed by McAfee, and after an hour with tech support staff I was told that they would contact me on Saturday (this is Thursday), since they currently had no clue.

0,"There were major glitches in the TurboTax Business program that I downloaded from Amazon. After days of frustration and hours on the phone with the Turbo Tax agents, they finally agreed that problems existed and gave me a new program.  Unfortunately, the files which were saved also carried some of the glitches forward with them so I ended up having to delete the files and start from scratch.  It would have been easier and far less time consuming for me to simply enter my information directly on to the Federal forms and not have tried to use Turbo Tax."
1,I am very happy with it!
0,Didn't work. Unable to use the product code key at all :(
1,"Easy way to purchase, no need to wait for delivery!  Dynamic pricing cost me a few dollars because I didn't buy it right away and the price in my cart went up.  Still cheaper than any hard copy.  As far as the program, Turbo Tax Rocks!"
1,"I love Avast....wish I could afford to pay for their complete version, but being on a limited income does not afford me that joy.  It stops threats and alerts you that it has and I love that....I would recommend this antivirus version to anyone who is looking for an excellent free one....."
0,My wife and I each have a basis for our IRA accounts.  The basis needs to be calculated each year and passed on to the next year.  When TurboTax loaded our info from the previous year's TurboTax files it did not carry forward our basis.  If I hadn't noticed the higher tax amount for 2014 I would have paid excess taxes and at a later date be stuck with straightening out a mess.  Don't let the TurboTax claim that your taxes are 100% accurate give you a false sense of confidence.

1,"I've been using taxcut and HR block and have never had any problem with them.  They work, get the job done and buying thru amazon makes it easy.  recommended."
0,This new product did not accept my earlier Quicken editons.  Insufficient options available to reduce the complexity of its many offerings.
1,I took a quick trip with Kitt today. I love the little added comments in between directions. Someone was thinking when they put together this software.
0,"meh.  disappointing, as I had an old program from Magix that I loved, but was incompatible with XP."
1,"fast, easy to use and effective."
1,Excellent typing software with lot of features.
1,Easy to install.  Good product.  Good price.

0,"I am one of the many Quicken users who had to find a new program after the loss of Quicken support and the pile of manure that is Quicken Essentials. I tried a number of programs and landed on iBank4 and have been using that for the last 2.5 years.<br /><br />iBank 4 was okay. I made a lot of feature requests and bug requests. While they told me each time I made a feature suggestion that it was added to their list, I never saw any new useful features added in the 4.x updates.  They made an iPhone app and a iPad app (neither which I purchased). But no new features for 4.x releases that I saw as significant or useful.<br /><br />iBank 5 came out. I thought &#34;great, here are all those new features I wanted&#34;. None of my hoped for features were included, bugs were added, the old things that annoyed me remained, and some things were made harder that didn't need to be. And they want me to pay for that? I think not.<br /><br />In all fairness, some things have improved. The budget screen is better, but setting up a budget is even more painful that it was in iBank 4. Editing a budget is far more painful. You still cannot duplicate budgets or reports (as far as I can tell). Envelope budgeting (which I could never get to work at all in iBank 4) seems to work better, and by &#34;better&#34; I mean it does something, but I haven't gotten it to actually work correctly. My imported data from iBank 4 was not as seamless as I would have hoped as some of my monthly budgets changed.<br /><br />Most of the &#34;big new&#34; features of iBank 5 don't really help me. I would love to see that list of features to which they said they added my votes to see how many user requested features actually made it into iBank 5.<br /><br />I am only part way through my 30 day trial of iBank 5, but so far it is a definite no-go. I will update this review if somehow my opinion changes. Otherwise, I will be back to researching other mac finance applications, or just run the Windows version of Quicken in Parallels.cken in Parallels."
0,"It seems like we now have to update Quicken every other year because of updates that makes our old, very similar package obsolete.  Frankly, it's nonsense, but if I want to keep downloading my transactions, I need to do it.  And there is NOTHING out there anymore that can do the job.  Monopolies suck."
1,Got what I expected
0,"Very confusing, not user friendly, complete waste of money with no return."
0,"We bought this hoping it would handle a rather complex return for us in 2014. Sadly, it did everything but the one item we really needed.<br /><br />If you need to file a K1, I would recommend staying away from this. We had to get Turbo Tax since they can properly handle a K1 form. HR omitted several important fields, and generally did a poor job on the ones they did have."
0,"This app works fine, however. There are a few pros and cons about it. The pros are its easy to use and navigate around.<br />Cons are that if you are a student using this product because its required by your instructor, if using for the 2nd time around, you must create a new email address in order to re-use it. I found this to be a huge hassle. Also, it is very frustrating with the initial installation. It took me a good SIX hours to get it to work properly.<br />And, if you're in a timed typing, there is no Pause button. More often than not, I would be in the middle of doing a timed writing assignment,  only to have an important phone call and not be able to pause where I was at, then continue later."
1,Been using Turbo Tax for years and feel as though I always get good results.
0,Typical Microsoft product. Too expensive and way too many gadgets that few really need or want. It does what's advertised and the only reason people keep buying Microsoft junk is because the new operating systems break the older versions or make them harder to use...
0,"I give Norton 360 2013 5 stars as it is a great product. It provides my PCs with thorough protection and much needed tune-up and does not seem to have any noticeable effect on the operating system's performance (like previous versions).<br /><br />FYI - Norton susbscription starts when the the product key is entered to activate the product online.<br /><br />Nothing positive; however, can be said regarding Amazon's pricing practices for this product. Prices vary almost on a daily basis from around $22 to over $31 for the Standard version and from $29.99 to $49.99 for the Premier version. This is unacceptable for a downloadable software product... unless (sarcasm intended), Amazon's representatives negotiate pricing with Symantec on a daily basis..."
0,"Was easy to use, and filed the taxes without any issues. But, did not know there  was a separate state e-filing fee apart from the state preparation fee - wasn't  clearly mentioned. They could Jane included it with the purchase cost."
1,"Yeah, it's a little pricey and having to pay extra to e-file is a bit excessive since it's not exactly new technology, but TurboTax definitely shortens up this annual headache.  Every year when I do my taxes it takes about a half day from start to finish with this.  It used to take me several days of work spread over a couple weeks when I did it on paper ...downloading the forms, printing them, reading the instructions to see what's new, trying to understand the government's backward methods for calculating things, trying to make sure I have all the right forms and won't miss anything.  TurboTax's step-by-step process makes it much easier.       ...the time saved is definitely worth more than what I paid for this.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend many more hours doing it by hand or try to find free online software that's as easy to use.    My only negative comment would be that I wish the government publications and instructions that are relevant to the section you're working on were accessible via a link from the step-by-step page.    BTW, I get the negative reviews about software bugs and download issues, but what's with all the crybabies who posted negative reviews claiming Amazon is misleading them?  People, the product description clearly says \\""State eFile is available at an additional charge.\\"""
1,Program downloaded and installed without issues. Very satisfied.
1,I love this app.  It is great and can do anything.  I really appreciate the people who put this together for free.  I can't afford to buy micorsoft word or office.  I really needed it.  Thanks and I recommend this to anyone who can't afford the alternative.  This is just as good.
0,"When I tried to file my taxes, I discovered that someone else had already filed for a refund and it had been paid out. Now I have to go through all the red tape and wait 6 months for my refund. The bogus person used turbo tax to file their refund. Turbo tax needs to protect the information on their site and I will NO longer use Turbo tax after using it for years. It appears that Turbo tax is the only prepared product to have this problem."
1,No serious problems since I started using Avast! Appreciate its function and no expense. I'm not very proficient with my computer so it's nice Avast does everything for me.<br />Thank You<br />J. Smith
0,Problems with activation. Stay Away...Great Customer Service from Amazon though. Will continue to shop online.
1,great product. exactly what i was looking for.
1,"I use Quicken for Mac.  My old version no longer supported financial institutions that allowed you to download financial transactions.  I had to upgrade to Quicken 2015 to allow me to continue downloading financial transactions from my financial institutions.  The upgrade went fine with little hassle.  You just need to know where to find your existing quickendata file which I found in my Documents folder.  I have kept my financial transactions for years on Quicken and is a nice product to look up, compare, backup, and reconcile your financial accounts.  I don't use all the features offered but use the functions that I like."
0,"I downloaded this program, which never really worked as a day planner for $19.99, I think it was.  And then when I had to have the computer repaired due to virus infections, it was traced directly to this program.  IT's signature was all over the virus, costing me $210 to get it fixed and to put it back together.  I am highly disappointed in Amazon, who I trust, for representing such a malignant program."
1,"Punch is a good app to &#34;help&#34; you get started.<br /><br />If you are looking for a program to help you design a home project Punch can help. I put together a closet I was doing in little over an hour. The main issue I had was learning the program. It doesn't have great instructions and the online tutorial was short and hard to follow. However, after lots of trial and error I was able to build a mock house based on my house with exact dimensions and come up with a rough draft for a new closet."

1,yes
1,"The savings varies but we have 3 employees and we will save $146.00 by buying this product from Amazon....worth the hassle for us. If you have more than 25 employees, it's cheaper to use Intuit.

0,"I think this would probably be a very wonderful program, however I wasn't able to use it on my computer."
0,It's ridiculous in 2013 to sell any software that doesn't include a version for Mac OS.  This is why I just don't bother with Quicken products.
0,I was disappointed that this version of Turbo Tax does not include all of the features it has in the past. Intuit made the changes without letting anyone know and it has backfired on them.  May be the last time I purchase Turbo Tax.
1,More simple to use.  Cleaned out issues Webroot had not previously detected on my computer and super easy to use as I am not real techy.
1,Thank you Turbo Tax for making it so easy for me to do my taxes this year. I have used Turbo Tax every year and it makes my corporate taxes go much faster.

0,"I upgraded hoping the problems with Quicken 2012 Debt Reduction Planner would be fixed.  They are not fixed.  I still cannot customize my minimum payments.  And in some cases, the minimum payments suggested by the algorithm make no sense - like the $830 minimum payment for a debt with only $403 left to pay down.  Don't bother.  Just keep the expensive check book register and find clever programs elsewhere."
1,like the ease of use and auto filling in from previous years. Helps get it right without missing<br />items.  Have been using for many years.
0,It does not seem to operate like most editing suites.  Nearly impossible to scrub in order to quickly can the videos or to find the perfect editing point.  I wouldn't recommend this software.

1,"I finally made the decision to move from Apple Aperture to Lightroom. I was reluctant to move as I loved the organization of Aperture over Lightroom. Sure LR had more editing features, but for me organization was more important than editing.<br /><br />What sold me was now that LR6 has the ability to use search for smart albums. No prior version of LR could use that feature. If you have several thousand of pictures, it is a challenge to find them.<br /><br />I had tossed between the CC and the standalone version of LR. My decision was the cost per features did not warrant the price, and I prefer to have access to my photos without being restricted in a subscription contract. I compared the full releases dates on LR, and that buying standalone versions ever time it is released is cheeper than a CC subscription, as long as they price is the same as of this writing.<br /><br />Here are some of the other features I found useful and improvement from Aperture<br />-Cropping using the Golden Rule Ratio<br />-Key wording suggestions<br />-Extensive developing editing features.<br />-Curves shows how the tone light will be effected without having to guess<br />-Powerful adjustments. I have been able to recover blown out highlights, grain, and soft focused images in LR that was never possible in Aperture. These does make LR somewhat aggressive, so you have to be careful not do go to heavy handed with adjustments.<br />-Auto Exposure and Leveling<br /><br />I also appreciate how LR has slowly taken the highlight features of Aperture such as facial recognition, GPS mapping, and printing books.<br /><br />There are a few features that I missed that are not quite available in Aperture<br />-Full screen editing, when you use full screen you can only adjust tags like stars and colors, but that is about it. I loved the full screen editing using Aperture<br />-Zooming in at 100%. It takes LR longer to show these views than Aperture. I find this critical for choosing the sharpest image of a set that I shoot. This slows down the process for me<br />-No shortcut key for Purple color Label<br />-There is no Orange color label like in Aperture<br />-You cannot stack images in Collection albums, only directly in the Folders box. These slows down the editing process<br />-Deleting pictures is somewhat clunky as you have to click in a dialog box or use Shift+Control+Command+Delete. This is somewhat clunky. I liked how Aperture had a Deleted Trashcan folder to make sure if you made a mistake. In LR, you have to go to the actual Trashcan in your Mac to recover it. I have made several mistakes accidentally deleting pictures<br />-You can only compare original master and the adjustment in Development mode. Aperture was able to do it in any mode<br />-Aperture had a means of adjusting keyboard shortcuts. I have not yet seen a means how to adjust shortcuts or add them for missing ones (like tag Purple)<br /><br />While LR is not completely the same as Aperture, it has enough similar features and an extensive more than Aperture that made it fun to use some days.<br /><br />That said, I have had it crash on my me a few times. Aperture had never crash on me. It is a small thing, but annoyance.<br /><br />For a side note, I got the Exporter for Aperture on the Mac App Store. This add made it extremely easier for you to migrate your photo into a different platform such as Lightroom. I highly recommend it for those changing from Aperture and moving to LR.<br /><br />Hope this helps other Aperture uses for making a decision.e of a set that I shoot.

0,"If you've been using Quicken Deluxe, beware that you might not be able to load your old data files.  If you planned to start from scratch and don't care about your old data, then it doesn't matter.  For me, I wish I could get my money back.  I've been using Quicken for a long time and Quicken 2010 Deluxe for the last couple years.  Since I only use Quicken to manage a few checking/savings accounts, I thought the Deluxe version was way over-priced.  When I saw the starter edition, I decided to upgrade.  It converted my data without a hitch but when I loaded the file, it told me I'm using features only available in the Deluxe version and prompted for an upgrade.  When I select No, I'm put back at square one.  The file probably contains some stupid report that I created back in 2010 and have never used since.  I'm extremely disappointed!  Since Quicken cannot be installed side-by-side, I had to uninstall 2012 before I could re-install 2010.  I tried using the 2010 Export option (one of them exports everything in one shot).  But after uninstalled 2010 and reinstalling 2012, I discovered that 2012 only support the .QIF import (which does one account at a time).  I'm frustrated enough now that I'm debating whether to uninsatll 2012 and install 2010 again.  Or to just abandon Quicken completely."
1,"LR is well designed and thought out software program for the photographer that shoots a lot.  It is feature rich which gives it a steep learning curve to know all that the program will do.  It is at its best for batch processing of images that have similar lighting, where Photoshop and other RAW processors are better at working with individual images as one-offs.  But for the price it can't be beat."
1,I needed power point for a college speech class so I bought this and downloaded it. I started downloading and I used the 32 bit download as recomended by Microsoft.(It told me it was the recomended version) By the way I also had Office 2003. It asked me if I wanted to update what I already had. I answered yes. I made a phone call to a friend while downloading. When I was done with the phone call everything was done and working fine. I had no problems. By the way as I mentioned in my title I am in no way a computer expert just your average person. So I had no problems and am happy with the decision to buy this and download it right away as opposed to waiting for a disc in the mail or having to drive down to a store and get it. Thanks Amazon! P.S. Sorry others had problems but I had none.
0,Terrible! Spent 1 hr trying to activate. No luck. Serial numbers simply didn't work!!!!!!!
1,Didn't know about putting in key code to get full year. When i read the reviews i found out. Norton needs to put that information when you purchase the software. Other then that it's great!
1,"i,m very happy you will include the schedules you removed next year.  I shows you are listening.  Satisfied Customer"
0,"Avoid this product.  Has created all sorts of errors and glitches with the normal operation of my laptop including &#34;script errors&#34;, black screen, slow performance and other annoying problems.

1,it works....what else can you say
0,"For reasons into which I have limited omniscience, Amazon has elected to replace a proper desktop client (which, albeit clunky and buggy, integrated with Microsoft Windows and allowed bidirectional synchronization of files and folders) with an application that essentially replicates functionality provided through its website. With the exception of synchronization of photographs with telephones/tablets, management of the system is a manual endeavor. This significantly undermines the utility of the Cloud Drive, particularly for those of us that are power users.    Consequently I am going to spend an entire weekend offloading my data and moving it elsewhere. And discontinuing my subscription thereafter. I suggest others carefully consider their intended use of this product offering before committing to any sort of upgrade. What a shame, I really like Amazon."
0,I have been a quicken user since the very beginning and have been happy until i bought Q13. this version is so difficult to use and I have had so many issues with it. I have had to reload it several times after hours on the phone with Q help. I have had the same issue with my moms version.  you cant see the transactions and there isn't as much detail as early versions.I wish I never bought this upgrade.
0,I really need this tool to synch to a local folder.  I want to be able to just copy files in on a regular schedule... like I do with Microsoft One Drive and DropBox.
1,I put off getting a new computer because I thought it would be time consuming & difficult to transfer all my files. Laplink transferred all my files to my new pc quickly & without problems.
1,"For the past decade or so I have relied on TurboTax to complete my own annual tax returns. I do not have any complaints, and have been very pleased with this software."
1,Easy to use.
1,Good software.
1,"Great Internet Security!<br />I use this one in my desktop and Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security in my laptop.<br />Titanium is simple, but strong Internet Security software. Not many settings, not many modules to play around with. Norton Internet Security has many modules and allows one to play with complex settings. It asks for more resources then Titanium, but also offers a WIDE range of security modules and provides a strong, more than enough security.<br /><br />I would say, if your computer has more resources at disposal and if you are a computer geek, you should go with Norton Internet Security.<br /><br />You can always go inside settings and control which modules be kept activate. This way you would be able to control CPU usage and not let CPU used by unnecessary modules of Norton; still you have those modules just a few clicks away if you ever need them, unlike Titanium."
1,Did the trick!
1,"I'd never done anything like this before but wanted a simple program that I could quickly put together a slide show for a funeral.  I chose this program based on another's review of their success.  The results were very professional looking.  I liked the ability to crop the photos and add captions, which people really appreciated.  It was fun to do but time-consuming as I had to learn to scan and figure out the program.  Because I didn't know what I was doing, I chose the wrong button at the end, and it did not save all my additions and edits.  Also, for some reason it would not let me attach all the photos from my computer's file, but it would let me scan them again into the show.  After spending all day redoing the show three times, my time ran out, but what I had - half the show - was still a big hit!  Now that I know more, I'm going to create the complete show as planned - for gifts.  So...Tip 1) make hard copies of all the photos, then put them in the order you want, write the photo and page numbers on the page as a guide for when you attach the photos/clippings - or in case you have to re-do the show! 2) practice with just a few photos (not 87!) till you know how to save everything!, 3) add comments, colors, etc., 4) have any music already on your computer ready to attach.  I didn't have time to add music then.  So I had live music instead, which added a lot to the presentation.  I look forward to making more slide shows and exploring the full capabilities of the program.  Enjoy!  Ps.  I originally ordered the VideoShow Expressions Deluxe 2 by mistake.  It's probably a great program by the same company, but it was way too complex for me, a beginner - especially then."
0,"Don't bother - at least for Windows 8.1.  It downloaded but would not finish the installation process.  You get what you pay for and at a cost of 0,<br />| guess you get nothing.  I won't try the Drawpad Pro if that is what they were hoping."
1,This software is great. I have a little previous experience with software like this so I am able to modify and organize files with ease.<br /><br />I can see why others might find it hard to use at first. I would encourage you to explore and experiment with it!
1,Works great - was easy to install!  Cheaper price too.  Much better than going to the store to buy it!
0,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this program, graphics were so old fashioned and options were very limited. I should have researched more before I spent the money."
1,"My taxes are fairly simple, as every year the last 5 years, did my taxes, submitted and done with that &#34;chore&#34;.  THNX Turbo!"
1,"I got the basic version for home. The main thing I was after was to download and post transactions from my bank accounts. That part works just fine, and it categorizes transactions pretty well. The navigation between the graphs isn't as slick as I'd like, but it still does the job."
0,"Download worked well, software easy to follow, I basically used it to verify data I had already processed, like a double check. Cheaper than Turbo Tax."
1,This worked great for my 2012 taxes.  No problems arose with being audited or any other issues.  It was also very helpful at explaining things when clicking the small question mark button.  Doing taxes was made quick and easy with TurboTax!
1,"I have been using free avast for about 6-7 years.  I like it because it does not tend to &#34;take over&#34; as some antivirus software does.  I like the fact it alerts me to problem ware  as well as lets me know it is doing its job with up date alerts.  I also like the easy stop to down load & install programs and of course it monitoring all programs.  I have tried others before settling on Avast.  I have it on my laptop, desk top, and phone.  Awaiting the usage for my kindle fire to be come available.  When asked by friends I readily suggest Avast to them.  I also let them know there is a pay version, most of them do less on the computer than I. I am perfectly happy with the service free avast has provided for my devices over the years.  With the updates of Win-8 & 8.1 it is still working well.  Thank you for asking."
1,I've been using Avast for a few years now. It's always been solid and doesn't hog resources.  Keeps me safe and it's free.  I'm not sure how you can get better than that.
0,"- This is a product not ready for release.<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade because one of the banks I am downloading data from drop support for the version I was using (2011) without any warning. So I don't have a choice other than upgrading.<br /><br />Quicken used to be a good product with the reputation of listening to their customers. But this 2013 premier product, was not ready for release, and they pushed it out anyway...When I purchased the product, I didn't realize this is actually Quicken's new deceptive QA recruiting campaign, and unknowingly paid and signed for the testing effort for the product :-(<br /><br />Look, by the end of Feb 2013, Quicken 2013 Premier is already in its 11th patch release...You can imagine the number of bugs they have found since release...Had I known this, would have never purchased the product...<br /><br />- Terrible upgrade experience<br /><br />After upgrade, download from one of my bank account has the payment and deposit completely reversed. So my monthly salary deposit is recorded as payment going out of the checking account...Later support help me to figure out that this not a generic issue, it may be related to the upgrade to my particular account with over 10 years of history...It is alarming that such a mistake can happening with the product.<br /><br />Also after upgrade, every time I open quicken, there is warning about my Unicode setting on, which I need to keep to have other applications running...there is no even an option to disable this warning...It is ok to see the message at the first time, but every single time I open quicken, i have to be reminded and warned, it becomes annoying. Whoever design this feature, obviously does not use the feature, and does not care about how his customers use this program.<br /><br />- Terrible support<br /><br />It was wrong to release a product that was not ready, and the support made it even worse. When talking to support about the issues I encountered, the first support rep was now knowledgeable about the problems, and I was told that this was my \\""IT problem\\"" not quicken's problem. I have to escalated to his manager to get the problems resolved.<br /><br />- Terrible Bank Support<br /><br />This is not an issue with Quicken alone...but it really makes you question whether this product has a strong reason to exist if they cannot provide a smooth integration with the banks...I have different issue with both Citibank and Wells Fargo...when problems happens, you don't know who to call, quicken or the bank...Quicken will tell you that it is the bank's problem, and the Banks will tell you that it is not their service. For Wells Fargo, they recommend you to use the \\""Paid\\"" connection only, so there are extra monthly fee involved with using Quicken.<br /><br />- Not Worth the Money<br /><br />You make the call whether it worth the money to do the upgrade...<br /><br />A word for Quicken, there is a step in the software development procedure called 'beta' testing, and if you want to do it right, you should officially recruit customers to do it, and pay them to do it...<br /><br />Using a false production product to use existing paid customers to perform beta testing is simply not right..."
0,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones in that the removal of Schedule D from TT Deluxe won't affect me this year. However, next year, if Inuit hasn't seen the error of its ways, I'll be buying an alternative product from another vendor."
1,It was easy to download.  A good value for both Federal and State.  I'll buy it again to do taxes myself next year.
1,"Since I started using Avast! a year or so ago, I have never had ANY downtime caused by virus, malware, or malicious websites.  What more could you ask from anti-virus software?<br /><br />Meanwhile, my work computer -- protected by one of the big names -- had several.  In fairness, that could have been due to company IT being negligently slow in pushing definition updates... In my mind, though, it validates how quickly things move in the virus world, and why centrally managed corporate IT philosophy is prehistoric."
0,"Regrettably, this software excludes Macs."
1,"After a few weeks of using it, it has asked me twice to enter my registration number (after the initial install and registration).<br />If using for basic stuff I don't see a reason to upgrade....<br />Besides that it works great."
0,"Shortly after loading and using this product I had catastrophic computer failure and had to reload ALL PROGRAMS AND FILES!!!  If there were a way I would demand a refund!!!  Needless to say, I made NO ATTEMPT, nor will I, to reload this program.  By the way, my computer is doing just fine without it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR COMPUTER AND AVOID DOWNLOADING THIS HORRIBLE PROGRAM!"
1,Great tool
0,"This software is too basic. There are no hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) for quick and easy editing. It's a steroid enhanced version of iMovie and or Windows movie maker. Although Windows may be easier to cut and trim with than Corel.<br />If you know nothing of editing other than iMovie, this is for you.<br />If you are looking for inexpensive more advanced/traditional editing software that correlates more with Avid/FinalCut/Adobe, than this is not for you.<br />I ciberlink has customizable hotkeys that makes timeline editing quick and easy. I'm going to trial that.<br />I'd say trial them first. I should have.... I just spent a worthless 50$"
1,I have used turbo tax for many years.  It's easy to use and I like going through each category to make sure nothing is missed.  Loved being able to download and use the product directly from Amazon.  I will do this again next year.
1,"I had problems with this & had to contact Norton  regarding it.  It actually was not working when I thought I was protected with it. It took Norton about an hour+ to bring it up to date.  Now that everything is working like it should, I do like it, but I don't know if I will purchase it next year through Amazon. I don't think this Older Version was a good idea. Norton is an excellent company to deal with & glad they got it straightened out. I might purchase it directly through Norton even though the price is higher next time."
0,"If you want to to backup to image, as opposed to cabling the old and new computer together and doing a ONE TIME transfer, the imaging software is another $39.<br /><br />I recommend you DON&#34;T do a one time xfer.  Do an image back up.  Then you can pick, and chose over and over your restoration.<br /><br />Maybe this discovery means zlink is not that more expensive since they based their whole migration off an image in the first place! On I go..."
1,"I downloaded this with no problem on a Mac OSX 10.7.5. It works perfect and have been using Turbo Tax for the last 5 years now. It will enter all your information from the previous year with a push of a button. I was having my taxes done by a professional CPA before using TT, for a lot more money I might add. Strange, the TT printouts looked exactly the same as the CPA's! I could swear they were just using TT also and charging me 4x the amount for their fees! I actually got a larger refund using TT than I did with the CPA (using the same years info as a test!) That test made me angry and I fired my CPA!<br />I did upgrade to the home and business version for $40 as I was going through my entries. I found out I did need this because I have home office deductions and Home and Business walks you through it with much more detail than Deluxe. TT saved me a ton of money this year! My Daughters and Son all use it too."
1,Product was easy to use and was able to e-file and get my refund back quicker. It's nice to be able to go through all the options.
1,I have enjoyed using this program with my girls. They love the hunt and I can see that we will be using it for many years since my oldest is 4. Really makes you look good at parties with other kids. Thanks for the great tool for parents.
1,TurboTax Business was purchased after I tried the H&R Block Product which was absolutely awful. The TurboTax software was easy to install and update. Everything printed correctly. It's easy to find the right forms and to look up explanations. The taxfile can be saved in many different forms.
1,"I bought this for my office employees so they can scan documents into pdfs and jpegs that can be edited and emailed.  Compared to a bunch of other scanning software I've tried, this program is the simplest to figure out and set up, especially for people that are not very tech savvy and only know how to do basic tasks on a computer. I was able to teach my employees how to use this program in less than 15 minutes and that included configuring the program and scan settings to their specific needs.  I've personally used PaperPort for personal use as well as for my business for 7 years now, and I highly recommend it."
1,so i recently just got my mac book air. i needed the microsoft office for college. so i decided to buy from amazon since the price seem to be the cheapest. it went through the process of downloading and all that stuff. and when it came to the time of downloading it didnt work there was n error. i tried again and error. so i decided to contact amazon and i did. the lady was nice and told me to download the free trial from the microsoft office mac trial. and to download the free trial. when it was done downloading to put in the product key that amazon give me. that it should work if not to contact them again. and i did specicfically what they told me. and it works great =]. it downloaded pretty fast. and the key worked. even though it didnt download directly from amazon that i had to do extra time to download it from office site. i still rate it a 5. now my mac is complete =]
0,This was a mistake for what I was looking for. And I can't return it because it was a PC download. I was looking for a beginner game that I could create fun comics however this is more for experienced graphic designers. I was confused about it and am going to end up deleting it off of my computer.
1,"seems like a great anti virus this version however does not work with windows 10. however that lead me to their website and they do have it available to download for windows 10 i tried it out seems okay but has too many interruptions, very gimmicky wants you to purchase at a special rate within a few days. ended up paying for norton internet security instead. if you want a free anti virus i recommend it. just not my cup of tea"
1,Started on Quickbooks a few months ago. Pretty easy to learn. Haven't set up payroll yet. Hoping this will go as smoothly as setting up invoices and estimates. No complaints so far with what I have been taught.
1,I have used H&R Block Tax Software for years and just love I. The online and phone help is fantastic.

1,"Upgraded from Quicken 2011, support ending.<br /><br />Features about the same, transactions slower on a new Windows 7 computer vs. older XP computer."
1,"Upgrading Windows 7 from the basic Home versions is incredibly simple now with the built-in \\""anytime upgrade\\"" function of Windows 7.<br /><br />On occasion I've had the process fail and every time it was related to updates.  Do yourself a favor: make sure your system is fully patched and updated by using Windows Update BEFORE applying the anytime upgrade code.<br /><br />I've used at least a dozen of these, and all have worked flawlessly after making sure all updates have been applied first... can I stress that enough?  ;-)"
1,Great
1,"I had originally bought Norton Antivirus when I bought my PC from Best Buy two years ago.  Once my original subscription was up, I bought the new NAV through Amazon.  After I installed it, the software kept trying to tell me that it was expired, and I needed to buy the new NAV through Best Buy.  I tried different approaches to fix it on my own, but the installation isn't very user friendly.  I did a chat session through Norton support, and they got the software working properly.  It works without being annoying.  I also like the Vault to store my passwords."
1,Avast is very reliable.  I have had no problems with viruses or hacks.  I can easily recommend it to everyone.
0,"I found out after I ordered it that I needed to download and install a download program. No way will I do that. The only reason for the one star is I love Photoshop and would love to have it. Since I didn't get anything at all, but did pay for it, I am not even one star happy. I did email back and forth with customer service and I think we have worked out a deal where I can apply the credit to something else, so I'm hoping it will all work out.<br />I do think they should be more forthcoming about what has to be done, since I don't like to put anything on my computer I am not completely happy about."
0,brought a lot of other files onto my computer causing it to run slower. Also created a series of pop-up ads on my web browser. terrible product.

0,"I chose  automatic map code method of getting the lifetime map updates for my Garmin Nuvi over purchasing the upgrade card because the \\""How buying works\\"" said, and I quote:     \\""You will be able to get your Garmin Online Map Code immediately after purchase. Enter your code through [...] and start downloading your map. You can also gift your Online Map Code after purchase via e-mail.\\""     NOTE the \\""Online Map Code immediately after purchase\\"" claim.     This is not the case. It has been over six hours and I still have not gotten my code. I used the call me service from Amazon to speak with a representative four hours ago, and he said the it was only immediate once they processed the order, which could take up to 24 hours. I have purchased literally thousands of electronic downloadable products (whether it be software through Kagi, or esellerate, or music and videos through the Apple iTunes store) and this is the first time that this has happened.     The Amazon representative told me the delay \\""was for MY protection.\\"" That the all first-time purchases have to be manually reviewed before they can be processed. Even though I have been a one-touch customer with a CHASE Amazon.com account since 2002.     That's great that Amazon wants to protect me, but I have to go to bed now, and I am leaving early tomorrow for a trip and need to update my Nuvi. I won't have time in the morning, and I have waited up way longer than I wanted to waiting to get the code I was billed for six hours ago. So now I am going to be a tired driver with an out of date map. Great.     THANK YOU AMAZON."
1,"This is a great program.  I was able to instantly download it on line and start to use it immediately.  Produces very good, professional looking business plans."
1,"I have attempted to use other products available and was so pleased with what I could do with the Movavi Video Converter.  No matter what camera I use from my SLR, Digital even our phones, the software takes it and I can get as creative as I want.<br />I was able to do a training video on our ranch sorting software using Movavi, I added music for the dead spots, added audio where needed and everyone was able to follow along and learn.<br />I highly recommend this product as it is easy to use and understand"
0,"Had a lot of problems with the program itself. the down load with ok. But the program not as sufficient. A lot of bugs. Feel, that, I lost money on the program."

1,"I have been using AVAST for more than 10 years.  Keeps my PC clean and all other PCs, laptops and Android devices in my family.  I highly recommend AVAST."
1,Great product - compared to Mavis which helped my wife & I improved our typing (we initially learned to type in school - try to find typing classes these days). My 7 yr old daughter has learned to type using this product which has kept her coming back (even when she's stumped - like typing numbers).
1,"Just downloaded the Windows PC App for a three month unlimited storage trial. I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. My Norton Antivirus warned me about the App but I authorized it and that was it. I'm now uploading a folder with 38GB of data. I'm able to visit my storage and play with it as it uploads. Simple and easy to do. I understand others are having problems and I can only say that each situation is different. Check your system permissions. The App seems to work perfectly well for me.<br /><br />Follow up:<br /><br />It took several hours to upload 38GB (which sounds reasonable due to the file size). Then this morning I uploaded several smaller image folders and the upload happened almost instantaneously. I have reviewed some of my videos and pictures in the cloud. I was able to view all media online (no more Youtube for me) and also created links to share some of the pictures with family.  The only thing I could not preview were my Word documents. Those need to be downloaded if I want to read them.<br /><br />As for files I decide to shared, they get listed on a &#34;menu&#34; of shared files for future management (each file sharing permission can be edited or delete individually). This is one of the reasons why I have chosen Amazon cloud, it is simple and straight to the point without any extra info on the page. Although I'm computer savvy, I get lost in a crowded environment and the simplicity of this platform has not disappointed me.<br /><br />Also, organizing files after they have been uploaded is pretty straight forward. There is no need to read any instruction manual about it. All buttons and options are clearly explicit.<br /><br />Pleasant surprise:  Some of my video formats were not playable on my computer. I am now able to see them in the cloud thanks to Amazon's automatic conversion.<br /><br />I'll add more info as I discover more details. It feels good to have a permanent and unlimited storage I can trust and organize forever."
1,I've been using H&R Block software to do my taxes for over a decade.  It's so intuitive and walks you though even complicated items. I love that I can import my finances from Quicken.  I tried Turbo Tax one year and switched back to H&R Block the next year.  I think it's a better product. Don't buy the Premium off the bat unless you know you need it.  The Basic does a great job for most situations and you can always upgrade on the fly from within the product if you really need to.
0,More than double the price of the competition (H&R Block) for the same functionality.
1,"Memorang is by far the best USMLE flashcard/quiz program/app out there. It's the greatest tool for drilling in facts and testing your knowledge and progress. I have tried several different online programs in the past, but this by far is the smartest choice. And at this price, you just can't beat it. I have recommend Memorang to many colleagues and family and they all have thanked me for it. I'm getting ready to take Step 1 soon and having done PASS program and Memorang I feel very comfortable and confident. And the App is great as well. 5 stars all the way! I'll be buying it again for Step2."

1,Easy to use; glad to be away from TaxCut and their high rates and reduced services.
1,This works well. It does what it's meant for.  This is a worry free product. I'll renew the same way when it's time.
0,"Unfortunately ended subscription before the deadline, a 1 year !!"
1,I have used Quicken for years and have never been disappointed with Intuit upgrading the features each year to fix today's financial demands. Definite must for those of us who do not need an accounting program like QuickBooks.
1,You can not go wrong at all!!! This thing is the best anti-virus hands down. Plus it all free....<br /><br />Avast all the way
0,"Anyone familiar with Intuit products knows that the company generally reduces included features within a product in favor of charging for them as add-ons, or paid bonus content. They have almost too many versions of quickbooks to count, and within each of those versions, there are sub-versions that you also need to purchase. I have used Turbotax for almost 10 years, and have been happy that the &#34;remove then charge extra for&#34; mentality of the features was left alone with this product - until this version. Intuit has removed more functionality in this release, and makes you purchase add-ons for another $40. I'm done with being nickel and dimed by Intuit. After purchasing this version and seeing this, I'm also done being an Intuit customer of their quicken for my home expenses, and quickbooks at my business. Good going Intuit - Hope it was worth losing another customer across multiple product lines."
0,same as last year except that it will not let you file Schedule F.  so you have to upgrade another $10.  another hidden cost.
0,"For the last 8 YEARS, TurboTax had been a great solution for me to enter in our family's financial details and it 'magically' knew which forms (especially Schedules C & E) applied to me and filled them out.  I trusted this software to get it right.  But their decision to suddenly and quietly REMOVE key parts of this 'magical ability' effectively REMOVED my TRUST that they are a solution to my tax software needs!  I will NOT buy this newer, 'dumbed down' version, and will instead migrate to the H&R Block software.  Perhaps H&RB will get my NEXT 8 YEARS of business...or more!!"
1,GOOD...
1,Ok
1,I have used TurboTax products in the past and they have always worked well for me.  I have to give it four stars as at one point it suggested I upgrade the product to get more information on a single possible deduction.
1,"I used TurboTax, and went to a tax professional just to see if there would be a difference in my refund. Both TurboTax, and the tax professional, came up with the same refund. Save your money, use TurboTax!"
0,"This product was a hugh disappointment. First when it came to loading it did ok. but it would not work with company to sync/register it. Then it is a lot of work to make a good menu, not simple as the company suggests. Not to many recipes with order, so I went to allrecipe and had to build recipes to use. So I worked with it and made three weeks of menus, recipes, and shopping list, saved them but when I went back to use them they were gone, not saved on my computer.<br /><br />I would not recommend for anyone to buy this program."
1,I've used Turbo Tax for 7 of the last 8 years. I tried a different tax filing program one year and ended up buying Turbo Tax that same year again because the other program was just awful.  TurboTax rocks!
1,"have used for 3 years and it works great. The only issue I have is the updates of other programs, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.<br />But i won't use anything else. I recommend it for anyone who wants to protect their computer."

1,free and work great so u dont have to pay for microsoft
0,"Bought and downloaded what I understood was 1 year of coverage but it kept coming up with 15 day free trial and asking for product code which was not mentioned in the email, but an activation key was....turns out they are one and the same...maybe Norton and Amazon administrators need to COMMUNICATE more and decide on one name or the other....IT WOULD SAVE MANY CONSUMERS A LOT OF UNDUE STRESS!"
1,the greastest story every told
1,I have used TurboTax to do my own taxes for seven years now and it has been the absolute best software package. It's very easy to use and clearly walks you through each and every step of the filing process. I would recommend it to anyone!
1,This is a great product and now you get a free fico score with it.
1,"I am among those who switched from TurbTax this year because of their unbelievable greed. TaxAct does the same thing and just as well at a fraction of the price of TurbTax. My only complaint against TaxAct was that their form view was on a dark purple background with black writing on it. For me this was almost unreadable. I, or TaxAct, made an error in filling out my Form 8888. Their form view would have made a snap of correcting that if I could have read it. Form view is unique to TaxAct and a great feature. I got in touch with their technical support and they told me I had inadvertently switched colors and how to correct it. They replied to my email within a few hours. Good program. Good tech support, I will buy it again next year."
1,We have used Turbo Tax Deluxe the last 6 years and we think it is the best. We have no had any problems when we submitted our returns to the IRS. Great program and will continue to use it in the future
1,McAfee is an exceptional anti-virus program for the money.  I have been using it for years and have never had any problems.
0,"I believe that this has been discontinued, and well it should be. Using this software was like having one's teeth pulled.<br />Microsoft's DVD-Maker is far better and more straight-forward for basic youtube-to-dvd conversion."
1,"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 is a tremendous improvement from the basic/standard Microsoft Word program. I was so excited to see the numerous options for Word documents. When you select a particular format for your document, the format seems to work WITH you rather than challenge your insistence for a particular setting. Even though it's limited to 1PC/1User, the benefits of the Microsoft Word program alone makes the limitation well worth the cost and effort."
1,"If you're just starting out, or you even have a CPA and a medium-sized business, Quickbooks Online can quickly and easily integrate into your CRM and become your personal accountant! Great to show your bank profit and loss statements, invoicing your clients, and even allowing them to pay with a credit card on the go with quickbooks' credit card reader!"

0,Budget doesn't work. Some bugs with entering transactions.  Don't really trust the reports either at this point.  Does the basic download stuff just fine.  Suggest you use something else unless you are already locked in to Quicken.
1,"Ya know, a lot of people are grumpy about Quicken for Mac.  I too was a user of Quicken for Windows for a '100 years'.  It was the only thing keeping VMWare on my Mac for a long time.  But I finally made the leap with Quicken Essentials about 18 months ago.  And I've now upgraded to Quicken 2015 and have been using it for a couple months.  Sure, the Mac Versions do not have all the features of the Windows version.  But that is not what is most important to me.  What is most important to me is that the product works and does what it claims.  Quicken Mac does.  I have never had my data lost or corrupted due to Quicken.  That is what matters most to me.  I can deal without some bells and whistles as long as the product works as advertised.  And this one does.  And btw, I did try some of the Mac alternatives out there before I jumped to Quicken Mac.  And the ones I tried all had quality or reliability problems (duplicate downloads, etc..).  Couldn't trust them.  So, I rate this product well.  I got what I paid for, it has covered all the basics (and then some) and it works."
1,I was a beta tester for the 2014 Premiere product and had little issues with the product. Currently on Release 2 and things are working fine.<br />I am glad Intuit gave me an opportunity as a user to help roll out this new version.<br /><br />Support was good and user forums were very helpful.
0,"I am a long time TurboTax user.  The product has been easy to use and apparently accurate all those years, but this year the product has picked up a few bugs.  For starters, when you install it, it says you have to download the updates. Fair enough, do it. It does the 15 minute download/restart routine, only nothing has really happened. When you start again, it says it has to download updates. Same routine, ad infinitum. Finally you have to say no just to get some work done. Then it can't find last year's return, and wants you to re-enter all your personal info. Eventually I got around this by manually opening last year's return.<br />The whole Q&A process in this year's version seems clunky - it needs some streamlining.  And when you start the (free) state return it asks you if you want to use the \\""Free\\"" State software, to which of course you answer \\""Yes.\\""  But it turns out to be definitely NOT free. Actually, it costs $19.95 for the free e-file."

1,Still using this program and don't care to upgrade.  It handles all my day-to-day tasks quite adequately.

0,Quicken owns this market but is still full of bugs and is quirky to use.  Features are bloated and too complex. Mint is a nice alternative but short on reporting features. Will continue to use excel to do my own reports.
0,"Some say this is not a gimmick that state is not included, but the description does say state is not included. Even though last year I paid the same price for Delux and it DID contain state. Plus, this item description says:<br /><br />1 State product via download (Print for free or e-file for $19.99 per return5)6<br /><br />I'm not giving them $40 for state when I paid $35 for the federal. Who are they kidding? I admit it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I guarantee you Intuit was counting on million of suckers assuming 1 free state filing was included as it has been for the last 10 years."
0,"I moved from Quicken Premier 2011 to Premier 2013.<br /><br />First - in the 2012 version (between the 2011 that i had the 2013 version that I purchased), Intuit changed the security structure. So, my 2011 data file password was somehow changed in the conversion to 2013 and I COULD NOT OPEN MY DATA FILE. I searched Intuit and this is a KNOWN PROBLEM. I had to uninstall 2013, reinstall 2011, open my 2011 data file, remove the password, re-install 2013 and then I could open my Quicken file...<br /><br />Second - the budget layout and budget reports are completely different and do not carry the settings over from 2011 so you need to go in and re-enter all of your report settings to get accurate reports<br /><br />Third - it is EXTREMELY slow. There is a 5 to 10 second delay after every transaction entry. Worse, if you update and entry and then go to an open budget report, it can take up to 1 minute for the report to refresh.<br /><br />After struggling with this application for 3 hours this morning, I have un-installed Quicken Premier 2013 and re-installed Quicken Premier 2011. 2011 doesn't have the mobile capability but at least it works"
0,not really great u have to pay for the full service
1,"I also just updated today after reading the below review.  I reconciled all accounts and did a backup before upgrading.  There were a few odd items with some of my older accounts but they were easily corrected.  I actually think the upgrade found these inconsistencies.  Anyway, cloud is working and everything seems to behave as fast as Q10.  I only wish there was a way for cloud to update without asking every time.  Maybe that will come in an update."

1,this DVD Software is Awesome-it works great I like it better than the Windows 7 version and now that windows 8 took DVD burning capability away and want to charge you another 100 dollars to get their windows media forget them and buy this! this has saved my life :-)
1,I would recommend this program to all of my friend<br /><br />the software work in the background<br /><br />We have the software on all 3 of our family computers
0,I had X5 from what? the 90's?  Figured two releases had to have some improvements.  Not that I could see.
0,It came with the virus .
1,"have been using Norton for quite awhile, have not had any negative issues"
0,"I've been watching the ratings on the Quicken products for the past two years and totally understood what I was getting myself into.  I resisted because Quicken 2011 was working just fine, but I had no choice.  My computer crashed - I had to rebuild it and lost all my software.  I could not locate the Quicken 2011 disks and thought about all possibilities before I opted for the feared Quicken 2014 upgrade.  Ever since Microsoft Money was discontinued and I loved, I switched to Quicken and even through its warts have meticulously managed budgets, carryovers, savings targets since Quicken 2011.  I knew someday I would have to move to something else but nothing was quite as good as my Quicken 2011 and the changing costs were huge.  I read a few reviews and a few people seemed to indicate that the conversion caused no problems so I gave it a shot.  The conversion itself was seamless (no hangs or stops) but once I went into Quicken - my nightmare - all my budget information was blown away - no carryovers, no savings target, no current month budgets.  The interface was also more difficult than previous versions of Quicken.  I have not gone back in since.  I started from scratch and switched to Mint - a modern and FREE tool.  Amazon does not give software refunds so I am screwed but I guess that's my penalty.  I ended buying Quicken 2011 online so I can access my old information in a state that it was.  I will never buy a Quicken product again - yes, Mint is owned by Intuit, but thank god it was purchased by them - please don't ruin it in the way you've ruined the Quicken experience."
1,"I used to use Photoshop CS6, but now I find myself using Lightroom way more.  It is so much simpler to use.  I like the fact that it does not alter the original photo."
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax for years and it is the best tax program out there, hands down.  Last year, I got a competitor's program for free in the mail.  Not one to turn down anything for free, I installed it and prepared my taxes.  Except, the refund amount was drastically lower than the previous year.  I bit the bullet, purchased and installed TurboTax and lo and behold, I was right in my skepticism, my refund was off - a lot.  This tax season there was no doubt what software I was going to use.  Turbo Tax, we have a standing date every January."
0,The software has so many options that the learning curve is greater than I expected.  It's not my favorite software for altering photos.
0,It never can be uninstalled
1,"I have used H&R Block home premium for several years and very pleased with the software.  Easy to use, very accurate and makes filing my taxes very simple"
0,bought this software through amazon and though i dont use blu rays all that much i would like it to work. when you buy this it is registered to amazon and you dont get a password for updates so the program will only run a short while without the ability to update it. POOR way to sell a product Really.
1,Excellent Internet Security product.  I buy it every year.
1,"Outstanding, long-awaited successor to Quicken 2007.  A little different, but easy to learn and master."
0,"Don't buy this product if you plan to use it with Fidelity Investments accounts to download transactions.  It hasn't worked since an April 2015 software update (it's now end of June) and Intuit is non-communicative about when it will be fixed and refuses to provide copies of older versions to existing customers as a temporary solution.  Horrible, unknowledgeable support, whether by chat or phone."
1,"Wish it had a manual. It is tricky to get used to at first, as it is optimized for use on a tablet."
1,"It's Norton 360 - it works.  Not too much more to say about it.  It works, it works and it works."
0,"I was looking forward to syncing with my mobile device but so far I am unable to register the product on the cloud to create my ID that is needed by my mobile device.  Everytime I try I get the message \\""OOPS, unable to connect.  Try again later\\"".<br /><br />  Also, there was an update to Quicken that I performed and the program would not come up for a short while.  Not sure what was going on."
1,"Constantly protecting, constantly updating and tuning up my PC = all ways in the background.= Love it! i REALLY HOPE IT ALWAYS WILL BE AROUND!"
0,PRODUCT KEY NOT RECOGNIZED BY NORTON- a WASTE OF $ 48.76 WILL NOT DOWNLOAD
0,After downloading this 4 times it would not install I have a MacBook with Mac OS X version 10.7.5 which the description said would be compatible with the software. I'm so bummed! If I could give 0 stars I would!
0,It very slow
1,"It does the job, doesn't hog resources, provides sufficient configuration and customization options, updates without problems and is free. What else could one want?"
0,Very disappointed in Turbo Tax because they removed Schedule C and others from Turbo Tax Deluxe..Will not purchase again.
1,"As a new user of Photoshop Elements 11, I found this program to be excellent in doing much of what I want to do.  There is a little learning curve, but not too difficult.  With some practice, most actions are intuitive.  The Adobe Photoshop tutorials help to see a number of capabilities of the software, but are not instructional.  I would advise to those who are new to Photoshop to purchase one of the many books available."
1,"Being a computer technician, I've tried many other brands and read articles about other antivirus programs, and Kaspersky is at the top of the list. It is an excellent product, highly configurable and has excellent protection from viruses and malware. I've been using this about a year now and just renewed for another year, and the best part I get to use this license on 3 computer without having to buy a seperate license for each of my computers."
1,"Flexible and feature rich, you can't ask for much more in a free software package. Also smaller footprint than many others."
1,"I downloaded this from Kingsoft, but it is the same thing so here is my story-<br />1) Bought a new Windows 8.1 laptop after Microsoft finished off my XP Pro.<br />2) Discovered MS Office is a 30-day trial, then rent or buy at an outrageous price<br />3) Downloaded WPS 2014 FREE to check it out<br />4) It's fantastic! I've been using MS Office professionally and at home for thirty years and still running 2003/7, later versions gradually got too busy for my taste. WPS does everything I need and more, and much more user friendly. Some esoteric things may be missing but nothing very important.<br />The files seem fully compatible and save and open in both formats. MS Office users, we are free at last! I really do recommend everyone to at least try this."
0,If you have anything even slightly special such as replacing an item that is NOT completely depreciated it gets VERY lost & declares it as INCOME!<br /><br />It is VERY conservative (always MAXIMIZES your taxes - read their guarantee).  I always use books such Tax for Dummies & Lasser's to check anything I'm suspicious of.<br /><br />Is it worth the $'s?  If you buy on discount it's okay.
1,"I've edited 1,000's of pictures and this product is excellent. It works best for people who shoot Jpegs though. If you shoot RAW, I would consider using Lightroom as your picture storage and make specific edits with Elements. They work well together.  Photoshop is great but a large learning curve, Elements is much simpler and has everything you will need. You can improve the look of the picture, crop, edit out thing you don't want, and bring in things you do like all smiling faces in a family group shot, or I added my daughter who missed a family reunion and you can't even tell she wasn't there!!"
1,Kaspersky is the best Anti-Virus we have found!
0,ok
1,"Great software , I'm very pleased with it!"
0,"Very upset with this service. My refuse download it through my computer. I asked for refund NOW they said it's non-refundable. Do not BUY anything that are Download. THey should have put \\""ahead up before anybody buying it to know this is non-refundable\\"" So we will know we can be \\""RISKY\\"" to lose money on this. NOW it's ripped my broke money. I'm trying to get into school and now they telling me it's not refundable and I need money for school to pay for class else.. My goodness Jeez. Thanks my first time ripped off by Amazon."
1,It's A great product and I was able to download it on my three computers... I have used it since 1997
0,"known issue with Mavis beacon, doesn't work correctly with satellites.  This should be in the listing in order to warn prospective customers."
1,"This is the best Anitvirus Progam, I have ever used. I love it and don't have to worry while I'm surfing the web."
1,The tax preparation was easy for both state and federal.<br />I was overcharged however in that at least one state one is free. I got charged for everyone. YUK.
1,"My computer is running so much faster now that I have PC Matic.  Had Kasperky on my computer before and it ran really slow, slow and slower.  What they say about PC Matic is true it really does run faster.  Thank you"
1,"Years ago, I manually filled in my tax forms.  Turbo Tax makes filing taxes easy.  It ask all the right questions as it guides me through the tax form.  Needless to say I like it."
1,"LR5 has really evolved from the earlier editions I have used and is now a complete workflow for 99% of my needs.  Add the NIk photo suite of plug-ins for even more versatility, or at least Nik Silver - the best mono converter bar none."
1,"Doing a complex return was easy with this.  Less so with TT, its competitor"
1,Easy to use. No issues whatsoever. Completed my taxes in a timely fashion. I recommend.
0,It says for mac but it used windows software for training which is bad for business. I purchased this because I thought it will have C++ for mac. This is a misleading of content.
0,Very confusing to a Senior to download  and so is this email .bad mistake to have rated it. however in future will not
1,"i switched because of turbotax's misguided repricing scheme. It took some getting used to as it's a bit different than TT, but it worked well. I use a schedule C and E for rental real estate. Worked well and imported prior depreciation.  Worked as well as TT and is significantly less expensive. I plan on staying with H&R for future tax returns"
0,"Run and hide from this and all Microsoft 2013 if you have a small business. They have made the licensing and installation a huge hassle for anyone not willing to make a Microsoft account for all their employees. Yes, they require an ACTIVE MICROSOFT ACCOUNT in order to use."
1,Premiere Elements 11 is my first try at video editing software. The software was easy to install and works well. I still have some work to do in learning how to use it to make my videos pop. It will just take time and effort.
0,I was never able to download either of these items onto my computer
1,Used on several laptops & computers<br />Performs flawlessly<br />Nothing Gets By This Antivirus Program<br />Auto updates are excellent and no nagging<br />Highly Recommended
0,"This program is totally unreliable using Windows 7 Pro.  I should have paid attention to the other bad reviews.  My to do list for today was showing some (but not all) to do items for later dates.  I filed a support ticket and got a prompt response that &#34;today's list should show today's items and rollover items.&#34;  I knew that.  It doesn't answer my question or solve by problem.  I get the feeling that support has canned answers and just choose one so that they can close support tickets, even if it doesn't  address user problems.  Furthermore, sometimes when I edited items, the program deleted them.  Also when entering undated items, sometimes random dates were assigned to them.  In my opinion the program is total garbage and is unpredictable in how it treats your data, at least in Windows 7.  It should be pulled from the market.  Totally useless.  I deleted from my PC after 2 days, and am currently trying the 30-day trial version of EssentialPIM, which so far seems to meet my needs although it is more expense."
1,Works as expected don't know  what else to say about it . download worked fine so how else can you rate something
0,"I used Quicken for years when it first came out and migrated away from the product in the 2000's.  I thought I would try the latest and greatest, but boy am I sorry I did.  I will go back to my non-quicken status shortly.  This release will not sync automatically, there is no reliable tech support, the mobile quicken setup is non functioning (this was the main reason I purchased this version), and the GUI is tedious to use at best.  I see know why the price was so good.  They can not give it away.  Really sad I wasted the money on this program.  I would venture to guess that Intuit has really shot themselves in the foot with Quicken 2014."
0,"It wouldn't install for me. It hung up on &#34;Please wait while we configure Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistrbutable...&#34;  It then just sat there doing nothing. I left it over night and it was still doing nothing when I woke up next morning. If that's the way the free trial works, I'm pretty sure I don't want the full blown version."
1,very good
1,"I have used many different antivirus programs, both free and purchased.  Avast is the best I have used, and even found a virus that was missed by my previous antivirus program.  It is easy to use and EFFECTIVE."
1,great antivirus i have tried many from Symantec to Trend micro and avg has always been the best i can not recommend this enough its the best by far detects virus malware ect before any other software
1,TurboTax has been very user friendly for me. I have used it for several years now and it has made filing taxes much easier. It transfers over my previous years info which makes the process even quicker. I will continue to use this product every year.
0,"I too have 2010 and will lose the ability to electronically update banking information. \\""Upgrade is without a doubt a misnomer here - typically upgades (at least with most software) refers to a reduced fee for current customers to install updates to the current product. Quicken makes you buy the software all over again for, as others have stated, mediocre versions. Forcing users to purchase new versions (not upgrading) by changing past version functionalities is ridiculous. I will look for another product."
0,"Year in and year out for at least the last 10 I have been an ardent \\""fan\\"" of Quicken.  I didn't think there could be a better product than the 2010 version, but I updated to 2012 when it came along anyhow.  A few weeks ago I made the assumption that the 2013 version would be a little better with a few new wrinkles to become familiar with.  But, wow, was I mistaken.  Things I could do in the 2012 version don't work in the 2013 package, and I have virtually lost some of the functionality that was previously available in the releases of yesteryear!  I am disappointed with the obvious backslide in professionalism of the Quicken group.<br /><br />Don in Jacksonville, Florida"
1,Great
0,"For me, it was a waste of money...don't see any real improvements."
1,"Great product, easy install and works great"
0,It was very slow starting up and then seem to freeze while using it. I will think twice next year before using turbo tax.
1,"If you have used TurboTax in the past, no surprises this year.  Pulls everything from the previous return for faster form filling and comparison to last year to see how your income and deductions have changed.  Explanations are clear and it walks you through or lets you just go to the sections you need.  Explains why some deductions can't be taken or fully taken.  The import function is easy to use as well, less chances for error in transcribing numbers.  You can fill in numbers in the question section or directly on the forms if you know where to go.  Really helped with new rental business calculations."
1,as always a good product.
0,"In the previous 30 versions of Quicken, in the date column of your registers, the \\""day\\"" would be shadowed in \\""blue\\""...and you could hit the space bar to go to month and year.  Now, its nothing and you have to put your cursor on the day.  Its terribly inconvenient!!?"
1,I really like this program it has helped my computer from being so slow and has stopped Trojans from getting on my laptop.
0,downloaded software and couldn't open it up. contacted amazon and adobe and neither one could help me. trouble with customer service with both companies. would not return my calls.
1,I use it each year but when a decent competitor comes along I will probably try something new unless the price goes down.
1,The download was very smooth and easy.  It even let me put the program on both my primary and second computer.  The program itself works well as it has every year.
0,no blank card format to make your own. you must use cards formatted with images.
1,met all my needs
1,"The 2014 version of Quicken deluxe continues to measure up as a user friendly, intuitive  program. I especially like the ability to synch mobile devices to the cloud. The mobile app is handy to have."
0,"i was charged twice for the same item and amazon told me i need to contact quicken.  Why? The money went to Amazon.  Correcting this should be simple, but because I am dealing with health issues, it is just not a priority to try to get the charged removed."
1,TurboTax has delivered for me for the last 3 years when it comes do doing taxes on your own.  Simple and easy to use.  Would recommend.
0,I don't understand why but I thought I was purchasing a year subscription when I purchased this deal.  As it turns out - I only got less than 8 months of service from the date I first purchased it - not even the date I started using it.
1,good product
0,"Here comes TurboTax 2013 and again Intuit has a product that installs easily but doesn't always play nice with other software in the computer. It also imports well from other tax software, but doesn't export to them. So once you consider its limitations, the rest works ok and the actual tax preparation is good..."
0,"I tried to install to my PC but it doesnt work at all, anyone can help me?<br /><br />I purchased : Microsoft Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade (Home Premium to Ultimate) [Online Code] [[ASIN:B004E9SKEG Microsoft Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade (Home Premium to Ultimate) [Online Code]]]"
0,"With Toast 7 you can EASILY do ALL of the following, but NOT on Toast 10...<br /><br />1.  Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to extract. Toast 10 just starts extracting ALL THE SONGS, and way too fast for good quality too.<br /><br />2.  With Toast 7 you can extract music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to extract from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are no options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!<br /><br />3.  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Extracting either."
1,I love it but you should add face cam
1,"I have used SnagIt since it came out and have never had a problem.  I like the program so much I have integrated screen capturing into my office work and organizing far more than I would have ever imagined.  It saves tons of time not having to type text descriptions of things I have seen on the web when I want to let somebody know through email.  I often make a quick screen capture of something as a reminder note. When a browser freezes when completing an online form you can screen shot the form so you don't have to remember everything you typed.  I grab sections of pictures for word documents all the time.  Anyway, you get the picture, it's surprising how many daily uses I have for this program.  It works seamlessly and the editor is great for simple things like adding an arrow or some text.  I've really enjoyed the upgrade process as well, great improvements at a reasonable cost.  No, I don't work for the company, I just like the program a lot.  Hmmm, I might take a screen shot of this form before I press the submit button, just in case it doesn't go through and I need to retype it."
0,"Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2015 hung while installing on a new (June of 2015) Macbook Pro with a &#34;Protection Disabled&#34; error message box stating that we needed to get the latest version, and gave two options but wouldn't let you click on either.  Neither I nor our company's IT manager were able to get it to work. We weren't even able to Force Quite the Error Message, and unfortunately it reappears on the screen even after rebooting.  Luckily I am able to restore a backup of my Mac from before this failed install.  I suppose I could have wasted more time contacting Trend Micro support, but my feeling is if they willing to release this faulty of a product install, I don't want to have anything to do with their products."
1,My son is a freshman this fall at a University this is exactly what is needed and publisher is a dream to work with so easy to setup whatever.
0,"I bought it because it said that I could download from my brokers and the old Quicken did not do that as well as was promised in this Quicken.  I continued using it just for income tax purposes.  I find it very unfriendly and the support is also foreign and I do not understand them.  I have a personal assistant that knows computers better than I do and he also has trouble.  It just struck me that for 2014, I should look and see if there is a different product that would meet my need better.  I liked the old Quicken and got used to using it.  The 2014 is not that friendly to me."
1,The utility worked just as I had expected. It was a good buy at a great price. I highly recommend it.
0,"The business program is buggier than ever. This is the third year I have used this program, and it is getting easier only because I am leaving myself extensive notes on the workarounds each year.  Watch out for these errors which are new in the 2014 business version:  For my 1120S return, in calculating the Accumulated Adjustment Account (Schedule M-2 at the end of the Balance Sheet section) the program is picking up the prior year total assets as a starting point, rather than PY retained earnings. You will need to manually override this amount.  I've found two errors in  how the program is carrying data to the K-1.  First, it is importing accumulated Section 179 depreciation to box 11.  I called a local H&R Block business tax professional to be sure that only the current year should be on the K-1. You will need to override to put only current year's Section 179 depreciation in box 11 (unless it is carryover.) Second, in box 13 of the K-1 the program picked up a 2013 SEP IRA payment made in 2014 in addition to the other nondeductible expenses. This is incorrect  - this deduction had already been taken in 2013. I checked my 2013 and 2014 TaxCut programs to verify that those programs did not pick up this expense. It is an error in the 2014 program and if you have a similar expense when you complete the worksheets to balance your books with the tax software balance sheet, you will need to override this amount on the K-1.  Also note, the program does not support e-filing a K-1, so it is necessary to print and mail the return."
1,It makes the easiest computer synchronize with school and work....  :)
0,You sold me 2010 software after I thought I was purchasing 2011 tax software.  It took me about an hour of trying to figure out why it kept trying to reprocess my 2010 tax return.  After I called Turbotax they had me check the year version under help and sure enough it was the 2010 version.  Then I had to call you back to get a refund.  The net result was a complete waste of my time and nothing to show for it.  I will be very very wary before I ever purchase any software through Amazon.
1,"I have used Quicken since version 5 in 1989.<br /><br />The capabilities have increased dramatically over time as one would expect.<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,"Good price and the download worked very well, thank you very much.  I have used the product for several years and really like it."
1,Perfect transition for anyone who is fed up with Inuit changing their product this year. Great user interface and had all of the features that TurboTax Deluxe used to have.
1,works awesome
0,"Last year I buy TurboTax. Unfortunately I missed the April 20 cut to upgrade for free, and had to pay the $30 extortion fee to pay a minimum gas income (that was less than 30).<br />Will never ever pay a cent to Turbotax after using it for more than a decade. Bye bye - Loose all your clients with this idiotic rip off techniques."
1,The program was easy to purchase and a breeze to load up on the laptop.
1,Will be buying one more.
1,I like the program on my computer. I cannot log into the app on my phone. It tells me the user name and password is wrong. I have tried to reset the password and can't. They both work on my computer. I think I am going to uninstall the app and maybe forget about it.
0,The detail on the first few lines indicates the product includes Publisher. YOU NEED TO READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION AND LOOK AT THE LAST LINE TO SEE THAT IT DOES NOT! Very disappointing!
1,"this is what I have come to expect from turbo tax but they failed this year, tax act isn't quite as polished yet but had all the features I needed"
1,"I have used Quicken since 1984 and been generally pleased with the product. While not perfect, it does everything I want it to do and has improved functionally and visually over the years. (How I miss printing checks on my dot matrix printer!)    After reading yet another year of generally bad reviews of the newest Quicken, I was reluctant to upgrade. But last night, I took the plunge. How did it go? Flawlessly. (I did run the R3 update after installing the download and before setting up Quicken Cloud or Credit Score.)    * Software installed and converted my existing Q2012 file with no problem.  * Activated Quicken Cloud and selected my accounts to sync, downloaded the iOS app, ran the sync, and all mobile data was spot on. No issues at all. (LOVE the app by the way.)  * Credit score worked perfectly.    In full disclosure, I use Quicken to track my spending by category, pay bills via Quicken Bill Pay, set budgets, and run reports. In these tasks, the new software appears accurate and capable. Glad I upgraded."
1,"I have been using this program for 4 months. I purchased a new computer and loaded this program as a low cost  alternative to MS Office. The program has worked great. I've used it for spreadsheets, documents and it has been great. I highly recommend this."
1,I use TurboTax every year.  Makes Taxes so much easier.  Especially helpful is the ability to import data from last year to save time.  And that it copies all the needed data for the state taxes for you.
1,A lot less than stores
0,"I love the turbotax products but when I attempted to purchase it from Amazon, the download was unsuccessful, the software never worked on my computer, and Amazon would not refund my purchase price.  I had to buy it again directly from Intuit.<br /><br />Lesson learned?  Always buy TurboTax directly from Intuit and never try to purchase it from Amazon."
1,"I like it, I've been using this for about 6 months, I don't have an alarm clock. You can set this to be an alarm clock face in the settings, turn your phone on its side and good to go. I like the fact you can turn the brightness up and down and set whatever mp3 you want to wake you up. If you double tap the screen of your phone it turns on your phones camera flash to use as a light. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it used to automatically turn on the alarm by default when you set it. You now have to hit &#34;enable alarm&#34; to turn it on. It's not a huge deal but not realizing that first night almost made me late for work. I wish they would make an option for it to go back to the old way, it just seems logical that if you're setting an alarm... chances are you're setting it for a reason. You can have it set to repeat etc, I am a truck driver with a varied schedule so unfortunately for me that's not really a valid option. I highly recommend this app though, and with it being on sale today you can't go wrong. I paid the 2 buck price for it and would gladly pay it again."

0,"This is a tale of two cities/products: the first is of a company that chose potential profits over serving a loyal customer base, and the second of an updated product that actually worked flawlessly. Like many other people, I have used Turbotax for a number of years and was largely quite satisfied with it and had no interest is even considering another tax filing software product. However, Intuit's recent decision to remove functionality from the so-called &#34;Deluxe&#34; version of the software (i.e., remove Schedules C, D, & E), and it's initial boneheaded corporate explanation for its money-grab, made me search for other products including H&R Block and TaxAct, etc. Further, I began to follow the outrage of many thousands of previously loyal Turbotax customers on Amazon and other social media sites. It became a daily activity to watch the protest and revolt of customers. The number of 1-star reviews on Amazon grew from hundreds to thousands. This may be one of the most vilified products in the history of modern capitalism. Truly a corporate blunder of epic proportions, and all self-inflicted by Intuit. The company truly deserved the scorn from its previously loyal customers.<br />  With that said, I read all the reviews of all the other major tax software products and seriously considered going with H&R Block. However, I have previously had good experiences with Turbotax and liked its user interface. With the restoration on 2/7/2015 of Schedules C, D, & E to the 'Deluxe&#34; version of Turbotax, I decided to go ahead and try it again, knowing that I could either return it or still use H&R Block if Turbotax failed to deliver.<br />  So, I purchased 'Deluxe' for Mac on 2/7/2015 on Amazon, downloaded it without any problems; it then did an automatic update when it first launched, and then I did my taxes. In the middle of the process, it recognized that I needed Schedule D, and it &#34;upgraded&#34; to &#34;Premier&#34; without any difficulties and at no charge. Itelectronically obtained from my investment broker all stock dividends, interest payments, etc. and entered them correctly into the tax filing. I completed my taxes within an hour, e-filed both the federal and state returns, which were subsequently accepted by the respective federal and state entities. So, the download process working flawlessly, the software also worked without any problems, including the automatic upgrade to Premier and e-filing of the federal and state returns.<br />  How to rate such an experience. I'd give the software itself 5-stars, but Intuit and its money-grabbing, customer disrespecting ways - well, I'd give negative stars if it were possible. They did make amends, but it wasn't because they were serving their customers; rather, they changed only because their loyal customers revolted against their ineptitude and arguablely their corporate greed. If I was on Intuit's Board of Directors, I would vote to change management including the CEO and Turbotax Division Director."
1,Pretty straightforward for a simple will.  We made a will and put in our safe-deposit box.  It works for power of attorney and works for for both spouses.  I haven't had a chance to test its legality yet. Not planning to any time soon actually.
1,Prior to this I had been using version 8 for several years and just didn't see the need to upgrade.  After deciding to upgrade and getting version 12 I'm really pleased with my purchase.  Lots of progressive changes.
1,so far so good!!
1,"I purchased this for my grand daughter.  Now, I can't pry her off the PC!!!  And if you ever have issues with the program, Amazon stores your product code so you can reload it."
1,It is so nice to purchase this software on line and be able to just download it and start using it that quick. I love nut having to go to the mall to purchase things like I had to in the past
1,"As of today, May 1, 2013, Quicken 2010 will no longer load an Export.QFX file produced by my Bank, to import transactions. I have received an email from Quicken informing me that, yes, version 2010 will no longer do downloads.  Well, clearly my Bank has not changed it's file formats - so this is intentional sabotage by Quicken.  Having been forced to upgrade to 2010, I am thoroughly disgusted by Intuit ... particulalry as the reviews on this product I am being forced to buy are universally miserable !  Unfortunately, I see little to do but upgrade - but also to post this review and suggest that if you are not committed to using Quicken for the last 20 years (as I am) choose a different software and avoid these pirates !<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />Now 5 hours later:  OK have installed new version.  Couldn't get it to download credit card transactions: very irritated.  Went to Quicken support page, contacted voice support - reached great fellow (offshore, I believe) who helped me get it set-up - no easy matter - and now, great !  In fairness, Quicken support was magnificent.  Have gone though the various prefereances and options, and believe version 2013 big improment over 2010.  Still irritated to be forced to update, particulalry as the update price though Quicken - with my $10 discount for being a long-standing user - was still around $ 60, and bought on Amazon for less than $ 40.  So, Intuit: if you are going to force customers to update, at least give a price less than the brand-new price offered through Amazon.<br /><br />So, have upped stars to 4 for good program - but would still click 1 star for Intuit's irritating marketing via extortion."
0,"This made all video on my computer stop working/downloading I called and did everything the guy told me to do and then I gave up and took it off compleatly and all of a sudden everything started working again, so it appears the problem was this product"
0,I couldn't get the product and Microsoft Customer Service couldn't be bothered to help me after it was already paid for.
1,"I have a lot of recent experience with Adobe InDesign.  In the 1990's I used Serif Page Plus.  Publisher is far more user-friendly, more intuitive, and easier to learn.  And once you are familiar with Publisher, manipulating text and images is faster than any other software program I have used."

1,"Best antivirus around, Works a lot better than McAfee ever did. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Updates itself daily."
0,It kept causing problems with my computer so I purchased a different one.  I CANNOT get it off of my computer.  It is a real nuisance and I am sorry I ever downloaded it.
0,"I have tried several times to install this software, to no avail. I have contacted tech support, who have provided me with two different serials to try, neither of which work. They had me do all kinds of editing to my registry, which also did nothing. I am now trying to install it on a clean hard drive that I just wiped and put Windows 7 on, and am still having the issues of it not accepting the serial. I think I'm just going to give up. I purchased the boxed edition, which is opened and therefore non-returnable. Sigh.    Note: I didn't purchase from Amazon."
1,Had to switch from Turbotax because they no longer support my Mac and went to H & R Block. It imported all my data from last year's Turbotax and it was just as easy to work with.
1,"I have been working with computers for many, many years and AVAST is far and away superior to ANYTHING else I have ever come across.<br /><br />I've been given computers with viruses on it that McAfee and Norton couldn't get rid of, but AVAST took care of it effortlessly.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this product highly enough."
1,"Nothing works as well, works as hard and updates as frequently. I've been keeping my systems safe for decades and although Peter Norton is no longer a part of it (probably enjoying retirement on some Polynesian island) the product continues to evolve. Connected computing today is risky and the internet is downright dangerous in many ways so it's a real comfort to have superior help. Don't broadcast your signal without it...<br /><br />What I don't like is that the program stops working if the subscription isn't valid. That just seems wrong. I understand that it won't update but what you already paid for should still work. The whole license issue with specific rights isn't consumer friendly. What if you bought a car and it just stopped running if you didn't take it in for a service during the recommended time period. No other industry gets away with that crap and neither should the software industry. Paying for updates is reasonable, but keeping the existing purchased product from functioning in my opinion is illegal, immoral and fraud. It's fraud because nowhere on the package or in the literature does it explain this limitation. You only get this experience when they don't continue to get paid on time. A constant, predicable revenue stream is a corporations dream and with Norton once they get you hooked you most likely stay for life."
0,Stopped working for no reason after a couple months.  I hadn't updated my software or anything.
0,"Pro:  The product is pretty good although you still need to know what you are doing in any kind of complex situation.  I've tried other tax prep products and this is the best, albeit imperfect.<br />I give it 3 stars because of the huge cost to do state e-file.  This is really deceptive price advertising -- they say it comes Federal + State, but if you actually want to FILE your taxes then it's another $25.<br />The other terrible thing is if you pay your taxes electronically.  You GET NO RECEIPT OR PAYMENT CONFIRMATION.  The instructions say to check your credit card bill next month to verify that payment was made!  And the service fee charged is the highest of all possible online tax payment choices.  OK, you've got me as a captive customer, it's much more convenient to pay as part of the finalization of the return, but if you're going to charge me the highest fee in the market, don't you think you could give me the convenience of payment confirmation details?"
0,"I bought this and installed and everything was great. I re-installed windows and then re-installed the dictionary again; when that was finished I re-entered the key and when the key is verified I get a popup saying, 'the number of installs has been exhausted.&#34; I contacted Amazon and they told me I have to contact the software publisher. Good luck with that!"
0,how to get the new 3-D picture pro and download
0,"The feature set for Quicken 2014 for windows seems good. I purchased it because, between Intuit's apparent indifference to its Mac and Apple based customers and my banks refusal to acknowledge it's Mac based customers at all, I had little choice. So since I can run Windows in a virtual machine on my Mac, I bought the 2014 Windows version. Sadly, the procedure to migrate a Mac account file to a Windows account file puts all of my transactions 100 years into the past despite following the the official Intuit  instructions to the letter, I can only surmise that their indifference to their Mac based customers is part of their corporate culture and they haven't yet decided that their migration document is probably two years out of date. So, because I've liked the product so much in the past I am holding out hope that I will find a solution - but - having been horribly disappointed by \\""Windows Centric\\"" companies who value profit much more than they value their customers... I feel I could be wasting my time."
0,"I'm trying to grow and refine my household budgeting and forecasting which is what let me to Quicken.  The possibilities of what will hopefully come of this tool are not realized as of yet.

I don't know if I can make more than one logon for this product or if I can only do shared assets on this program,<br /><br />I have been doing the tutorials and tried to be resourceful.  There's just a few things that I'm missing.

0,"*******see update 2/2/2015 below******    Bam!  Goodbye Turbo Tax.  I just switched from Turbo Tax this year due to them not including the Schedule D with the Deluxe version that I always used.  In the end, they raised their prices - big time (67%) - on me.  So, I opted for this HR product.    HR Block was $35 vs the $75 that I was going to have to fork over to TT for the Premier version.  The Deluxe version for TT is $45.  That was what I would have purchased, but since they do not include Sch D, I would have had to opt for the \\""Premier\\"" version.    As of today, Jan 15, I have been able to import my last year Turbo Tax data, and have just imported my W2.    The flow is similar to Turbo Tax.... I find that the updates on HR Block are not as frequent as TT.  That is fine for me.  It becomes a bit of a pain anyway to keep updating every time you launch the software.  So for me, HR Block has a better method for updates.    This is a great value.    I will update if any changes.....    *****2/2/2015*****:   Oh well... you know how it goes.....  I just went back to TurboTax.... Here's why:    I had a situation where I had some 401K activity that was placed on a 1099-R and it just did not calculate properly on the state return.  For the state, it showed my rollover as income, and thus, I would be paying big bucks......  Federal was fine... it was just a state (NJ) issue. And, this had to do with some after tax $$ I had in the 401K.  After tax as in - I already paid taxes on the money......    I was going to call the state of NJ, but opted to try out the online version of Turbo Tax to see what it would come up with.  So, I prepared a return on the TurboTax site,.  I only entered my 1099-R.... to see what it wold come up with.  I entered everything exactly from the 1099.   And, the result was that it handled the 401K transfer properly for both federal and state.    That told me that it was an HRBlock software issue, so I opted then to contact HRBlock.    I contacted HRBlockvia chat...... I got no where with them.  I explained that I went online - to their COMPETITOR...........TurboTax............ and that the two programs were handling it differently.  If anything, that should tell the cs rep that something is not correct.  Their answer to me was to offer to put me ion contact with a \\""tax advisor\\"" - no doubt for a fee.....     I told them they are making a mistake, but alas....... the rep just ended the chat.  Supposedly I am to get a survey from them to rate the chat... I will have fun with that one.    Now.........  Turbo tax is offering a FREE upgrade from the Deluxe version to the Premier version..... it will occur as an upgrade on Feb 7th within the software.  If you already purchases, there is a way to get a $25 credit.     Just call 1-800-445-1875.  Details about the upgrade from Deluxe to Premier and how to get the $25 if you have already purchased it are explained in the message.    And, now that I used both of these, yes, Turbo Tax does 'flow' better for me.....  I am hoping that Amazon will allow me a credit on this HRBlock software, since the vendor was such a jerk.  Normally they do not allow refunds on software.....    I knocked off 2 stars for poor customer service."
1,"It gets a little more confusing every year, but I guess so does the IRS."
1,I have been using Turbo Tax for many years.  It never fails to disappoint.  I highly recommend the product. It is excellent.
1,"I utilize my Garmin GPS all of the time. Because I travel often by motorcycle, my Garmin GPS helps with every aspect of my journey. However, because many cities and areas are constantly changing, having an updated map is a must. After all, your GPS is only as good as the data it is supplying. The great price I received made this purchase a no brainer."
0,"In general I love Microsoft products and always have. When I use Office 2013 it makes me wonder what problems they were trying to solve. It looks like they just changes things to justifiy selling more product, but have not offerred any new useful features.<br /><br />Remember the good ole days when you were working in a spreadsheet, and you could creat a new on with a single click? Now they have simplified this so it only rquires three clicks - File, New - then finally &#34;open&#34;, after specifying what type of spreadsheet you want.  RU kidding me Microsoft??  There are numerous examples of routine tasks that take additional clicks.<br /><br />I have survived the last couple of upgrades with third-party programs to add back some of the old features, and I'm sure there will be some eventually for Office 2013. Can't wait for an add-in that brings back some reasonable color options. They are trying to make me go blind with the washed-out white. Oh, but there is a gray and dark gray option too. That's it?"
0,"With AGI and/or MAGI is way less than 160,000, it shows Tuition and fees deduction as 0 and the same for The Hope Credit.  I checked this with H & R Block local branch and was told, it should show some number of deduction if MAGI is less MAGI based on your tax rate.  Confused."
1,"I have had Norton Internet Security for five years now. It does a good job, and has evolved into a product that is 'light' on my system -- does not slow down my computer the way pre-2008 versions did -- and protects my system reasonably well against incoming viruses. Each year there are additional improvements to the program.<br /><br />I will be resubscribing next year.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, because it did miss one Trojan virus that was caught by my Super Anti Spyware program. Most experts I read state that you really need one anti-virus program and a separate malware program. The two programs both running on my computer pretty much catch everything."

1,I've been using Quicken Deluxe for a dozen years more and have simply upgraded to the latest version. I tend to do that every 2-3 years.
1,"I'm so happy I bought this!<br /><br />I recommend watching tutorials on how to download and install presets for instant filters that are easily controlled.<br /><br />I love the amount of control you get especially if you are shooting in RAW and editing your raw files.<br /><br />I'm a wedding Photographer and this is my main source of editing, there is a brush tool for minor touch ups, I use it for burning and doging and to fix the sky, whitening teeth, softening skin the list goes on and on.<br /><br />This has sliders that allow you to control highlights, shadows, exposure, vignetting, lens distortions and even more advanced controls for adding split toning and filters.  the only time I ever have to go to another application is when I need to do advanced cloning which i do in photoshop, other than that I'd say 95% of the work I do is all accomplished in Lightroom.<br /><br />The photo attached was edited and styled 100% in this software."
1,"Installation was a snap. For what it's worth, I was told that Internet Security includes the Ant-Virus, so no need to buy both. A little disappointed that the download only comes in a \\""3User\\"" or \\""3Device\\"" format, everything else seems to be available singularly. Just Sayin."

1,It helps out alot cause it's a flash drive.
0,"This new version has a lot of the same as previous versions that can be printed as pre-made cards, banners, calendars, posters, etc. But, now every individual item must be downloaded and often times there are additional charges; $0.99 and up per item. Where before there were thousands of projects and clip art that were included with the software download. I was able to make what I wanted to make, a calendar with additional birthdates and pictures, it just took longer to find something that worked that did not have an additional charge attached to it. I am quite impressed with the updates of this new version in way of built-in page borders so your text or pictures did not shift off the page during printing; also that the text and pictures I add in a calendar, do not overlap the lines for that month! Much more user friendly."
1,I used Turbotax for the past 12 years and have switch over due to the free offer.  H&R block software works just as well as TurboTax and cost less.  I can not believe what Turbotax did to their customer.  I will be purchasing H&R Block next year.  Thank you H&R.
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax for years; never had any problems with it.  This year I did have a problem downloading it from the Amazon Website.  After calling customer support, I was told that I needed to use a browser other than AOL's.  I switched to Crome, and it downloaded perfectly."
0,If you're an average user this review is not for you and you should still buy this product. This will protect your facebooks and twitters without using up all your geebees.<br /><br />I've always liked Kaspersky AV because it was minimal and just sat in the background without interrupting what you're doing. 2013 had a few new things that got in the way but you could either disable them or their notifications to not annoy you. 2014 is a different story. Most of the new features I don't mind that much after tweaking but the forced Chrome extension is unacceptable. I get where they're going with this but I had to go WAY out of my way to disable it and get it to stop reinstalling. After a Chrome update it installs itself again. I've been using Kaspersky for a very long time and the product is pretty solid but that's a deal killer for me. Part of this is just nerd rage not wanting things I didn't install running on my system but there is a noticeable performance decrease with this plugin runnning.<br /><br />Make a power user friendly version Kaspersky. You used to be very power user friendly but after 2012 it's been a roller coaster shooting down hill and you're just about at the end now.
1,"I switched from many years of using TurboTax and I am happy I did. I find navigation is easier, presentation is better, and so is help. I really like the way you can view the complete forms as you go along. Overall I find it easier to use and recommend it over TurboTax. Plus it is cheaper."
1,Have been using flawlessly for 4 years now.  No problems.  When I will be using for work will buy the active program.
1,"Great software in all aspects: the package contains everything you may need: antivirus, firewall, antiphishing, antispam and even tune up tools for OS... Installation is quite easy (make sure you have uninstalled previous antivirus and other anti malware software and reboot your PC). No issues have been detected so far. Antivirus seems to be pretty good: I was using Avast prior to install Bit Defender, and Avast has never reported any virus on my PC, once installed Bit Defender, I performed full scan, which detected about 70 (!) infected files... on my other machine has occured the same...<br />I'm very happy so far with it.<br />Highly recommended."
1,Only used it for a week so still getting used to the new interface and learning where the key features are.  So far so good and lots of help already available on the forum.
1,"Corel Painter is a MUST, if you are serious about digital art, as it's unparalleled in the way it mimics traditional media. I illustrate children's books and Painter is an important part of my arsenal of digital tools. I wouldn't want to be without it.<br /><br /> It seems like many new to digital art wonder whether they should purchase Photoshop or Painter or something else. Painter is a necessary tool if you want to create art more like the &#34;old-fashioned&#34; way (like you would in a real life art studio with real paints, etc.) and are not intimidated by having to learn a very robust, and deep program. Painter is the program where digital tools behave more like their counterparts in the real world. Watercolors &#34;dry&#34; on your digital canvas, you can mix oil paints just like you would real oil paints in an art studio, and the digital chalks have that &#34;chalky&#34; texture. Even the digital markers behave like real ones - going on somewhat transparently with overlapping strokes that become more opaque as you continue coloring. Painter has tons of tools with endless variations and the ability to customize to your heart's content. You get to play with acrylics, airbrushes, charcoal & conte, chalk, crayons, gels, gouache, liquid inks, pastels, sumi-e, watercolors, and lots more. There are even particle brushes that create amazing effects like smoke & dynamic fur, as well as pens that paint patterns of flowers, or chain, or even neon. There are also tools that mimic famous painter's styles like Van Gogh, Seurat, impressionist style, and so on. You could sit and &#34;play&#34; all day and not even go over ever possibility of every tool! You can even change all of the settings for each tool, to make it something really unique, and save your settings to use again and again. There are over 25 categories of brushes, each with a multitude of variants. I looked up the official number of brushes, and there are 806 (compare that to the 126 brushes in Painter Essentials)!! Look at the screenshot I uploaded of some of the paint marks I made with various brushes. I went through the categories and painted on the canvas with different ones, so you can see just a tiny bit of the options you'd have with Painter. It's like having an art store on your computer. You can even pick out different types of paper / canvas (smooth, textured, colored, whatever).<br /><br />You don't have to be a traditional artist to use Painter, though. Painter also has the capability to take a photograph and turn it into a painting using the multitude of brush options via cloning options. It also has tracing paper! Quick cloning is a time-saving tool I sometimes use to make some of the backgrounds for my illustrations. The computer does a lot of the work to turn a picture into a painting (in seconds or minutes) with all sorts of options to make things unique, but you can fine-tune it and add your own personal touches, so that it's not totally cheating, lol. The 2nd screenshot I uploaded (of a flower) is something I made using the tracing paper and the cloning tools. It took me about 4 minutes to create. With Painter you can create art that is nearly impossible to create in the &#34;real world&#34;. And it has an undo button. ;-)<br /><br />There are also Photoshop style tools, layer capabilities (like many layers of glass that overlap that you can draw/paint on), selection tools, vector pen tools, a paint bucket (to dump color or patterns like plaids and so on onto your canvas or into a selection), color correction, and other digital tools you can find in just about any digital photo / art program. You really don't want to use Painter for photo editing though. That's more of a job for Photoshop. Painter is for…well painting, lol, (and drawing, sketching, airbrushing, etc.). You can paint and draw in Photoshop, but that's not its original design purpose. I use both (along with Manga Studio / Clip Studio Paint, Krita, Illustrator, and Sketchbook Pro). Theyare all important tools that excel in different things.  Another reviewer likened the Painter and Photoshop to a hammer vs. a screwdriver, and he's spot on. I have to have Photoshop to accomplish specific tasks Painter just can't do (a lot of image manipulation and that type of thing). I have to have Painter to mimic the real life painting techniques that Photoshop just can't do. Bottom line is if you want to paint, get Painter. If you want to do digital art that is more about manipulating images, get Photoshop (if you can stomach the nasty subscription model they moved to - I personally am sticking with Photoshop CS6, until I can find an alternative).<br /><br />Please note that (in my opinion / experience) Painter is NOT the best for inking (think comic book style drawing). I've found that Manga Studio (which is also known as Clip Studio Paint) is better for that, in that the lines are nice and better stabilized (there is a slider that will make it so it will auto correct tiny jitters as you draw). It is also not the best if you just want to sketch. Getting Painter to sketch is overkill and there are other programs that are better for drawing. I think Painter is truly BEST suited for PAINTING (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.).<br /><br />If you are NEW to digital art, I recommend getting your feet wet, first, in something like Sketchbook Pro (or Painter Essentials) that is much more inexpensive and easier to use. Sketchbook Pro is easy enough for a child to use. You can literally sit down, open it up and start sketching and drawing in no time (you can take a look at my review here on Amazon, under my profile). The basic tools are intuitive from the outset and It's very freeing not to have to learn all sorts of complicated controls & commands, etc. , especially for a beginner. You can try it to see if you like digital art, and then, if you do, you might be interested in pursuing something like Painter to take a step in a more professional direction.  Painter is a quite a bit more of a challenge with endless options that can be daunting to a new user, but Corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started. Also, if you would like to learn how to use it quickly, I recommend getting a month's subscription to Lynda.com. They have a great beginning video course on how to use Painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them. I've been using Painter for about 15 years, and even I learned something from the Lynda.com video for the 2015 version.<br /><br />Please note, if you are interested in purchasing Painter, you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a Wacom Intuos, or Cintiq. This is not a program to use with a mouse (imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse!). You need a digital pen in hand. I have used it with both of the above. Painter works very well with Wacom tablets and responds to the tilt, speed, pressure, etc. of the Wacom pens. There are less expensive tablet options (Yiynova, Huion, etc.) but they are not (in my opinion) as good as Wacom. If you have something like a Surface Pro, you can already draw directly on the screen. Anyway, the point is, you need something to draw with other than a mouse. ;-)<br /><br />If you already have Painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it, for me it was. The brushes are MUCH faster (no more lag time), the brushes track better, and the new particle brushes are amazing (and fun to play with, lol). I recommend trying the 30 day free trial to see if the upgrades are worth it, which is what I did. The increase in speed alone was so worth it for me (I'm on a bit of an older computer so lots of my art programs lag if I have a really big brush, etc.).<br /><br />Also, don't be afraid to get Painter as a digital download if you are like me and want the instant gratification of receiving your purchase right then and there, lol. I've purchased software downloads from Amazon numerous times, with no hitches.<br /><br />If, after reading this review, you have any questions, please ask via the comment button below. I'll be happy to try and help out!<br /><br />Bottom line: Painter is a worthwhile program that is the best at mimicking real life media, but especially paint. If you want to take your digital art to the next level, or want something that will behave more like the &#34;real&#34; stuff, and less like digital tools, this is what you are looking for. Just keep in mind that there is a LOT to learn, and if you are a beginner you might be best served by a less expensive program, to start with. Painter is an amazing tool that helps me create my illustrations, and I highly recommend it, with that particular reservation in mind. 'ons that can be daunting to a new user, but Corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started. Also, if you would like to learn how to use it quickly, I recommend getting a month's subscription to Lynda.com. They have a great beginning video course on how to use Painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them. I've been using Painter for about 15 years, and even I learned something from the Lynda.com video for the 2015 version.  Please note, if you are interested in purchasing Painter, you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a Wacom Intuos, or Cintiq. This is not a program to use with a mouse (imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse!). You need a digital pen in hand. I have used it with both of the above. Painter works very well with Wacom tablets and responds to the tilt, speed, pressure, etc. of the Wacom pens. There are less expensive tablet options (Yiynova, Huion, etc.) but they are not (in my opinion) as good as Wacom. If you have something like a Surface Pro, you can already draw directly on the screen. Anyway, the point is, you need something to draw with other than a mouse. ;-)  If you already have Painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it, for me it was.

1,More stable and faster than Norton 360.
1,Did our whole families taxes and worked fine! Been using for 4 or 5 years now!
1,"I got the Mac download version and installed it with no issues. I have used H & R Block tax software several times before and this years version is very similar to the previous ones. I did encounter one minor software bug during the preparation of my return. I used the interview process to enter a 1099-R income form and the software did not allow me to enter the fact that this income was a Substantially Equal Payment Plan (SEPP). I was able to get around it by manually checking a box on the form. Other than that, everything worked great."
0,I had QB Pro 2010 before and it supports non-english environment. But this QB Pro 2013 requires to set language for non-unicode as English. Otherwise you are unable to start QB. However I have other applications which reqire non-English for non-unicode. This is really so inconvenient.
1,"Initially I had some problems with the installation, but rosrtta support was timely and I am very switched on by with the purchase, thank you very much."
0,"If you want a good feel for how a good-sized chunk of people are reacting to this version, go on over to one of the many complaint threads on getsatisfaction.com (which Intuit is using to take customer complaints).  The title on one should say it all: \\""Budget process unworkable.\\"" Intuit has created a rolling budget system that makes changing entries and going back to make adjustments not \\""intuit\\""-ive.  Plus, it's a memory hog, needing at least 1GB of RAM to run correctly.  Several people have signed on to a petition asking Intuit to change things.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of multifeatured progams out there to manage your finances and investments. However, if you are doing primarily cash flow management and just want flexible budgeting, then You Need A Budget might be a better choice.[[ASIN:B000QO76HU You Need A Budget (YNAB) - Personal Finance Software]] It's also cross-platform, unlike the Windows vs. Mac versions of Quicken that will not move much of your data if you want to transfer from one to the other."
1,I have used TurboTax for lots of years. It is a good product.
0,"I have been ignoring all the pleas to Upgrade my Quicken b/c it made me so mad that they decided to Upgrade right after I have bought the last version. But today, May 4, Quicken still downloads all my credit union tranactions. Take that, Quicken! I don't plan to renew..I will find another product if they deactivate me.[[ASIN:B001D1Q7PM Quicken Deluxe 2009]]"
0,When my return was rejected by the IRS because of a missing Fed. ID number I went to the program to correct it. EVERYTHING WAS GONE. I had to start all over. I will be looking for a different program next year.
1,I like the price and also the protection.
1,"Work perfect in win 8.1, like it doesn't spend too much pic capacity"
0,Many of the standard functions don't work as well as my previous version.  Example when I change a value which has a split and it asks me if I want to change the split I can't do it directly. When I hit the OK button it opens the next line of my Quicken instead of the split window.  It also changed the way it works with my bank and now I can't download directly from it.  It may have a lot of 'advanced' functions but it screwed up the basics.
1,"Always chose this one as its easy to use, 100% accurate and cheaper."
1,"Very easy to use, walked me through each step and answered my questions on allowable deductions.  Great Work"
0,"If you need a decent office software package, you are not a professional or power user, and you are not tied to a corporate ecosystem using Microsoft Office, this may be for you.The price is certainly right. The &#34;beware&#34; part of the deal is this: If you are creating everything new using Open Office, go for it. It seems to do everything you are likely to need assuming you are not using Office to its maximum, and few do. If you have already existing PowerPoint presentations, then be aware that this may not be a good option for you if your presentations are even slightly complex.  I am an educator in a major hospital, and I have PowerPoints done on everything from Office early 2000s to 2012. Trying to get these to work in Open Office is trying, to say the least. The problems: 1. Animations are iffy. Some work, some don't work so well. 2. Even simple slides consisting of nothing but text often require resizing the text or the text box, or both, and repositioning the box inside the slide. 3. Slides with, for example, graphs generated from Excel data, do not display right at all, and I have so far not found a way to fix them. 4. Footers display, but not the same size as in PowerPoint. If you have a number of PowerPoint presentations that you need to keep and use, think twice about Open Office. The good point is, being free, you can always download the program and try it with what you have."
1,I have been using H&R Block for 5 years and prefer it to Turbo Tax.<br /><br />Historical data from previous years saves time and money.
0,"I've used TurboTax since 1998 and have been satisfied until this year, when the product deteriorated in several ways:<br />1. This is the first year that TT has crashed. The bug appears to involve Microsoft's Silverlight, but Intuit can't blame Silverlight because it is Intuit's job to test their software will all of the packages that they elect to use. Quality control has slipped, which undermines confidence in accuracy and in Intuit.<br />2. TT's software-update process sometimes reported an error.<br />3. I split my work over many small sessions. Every restart insists on logging into Intuit's cloud server. I want to do my taxes on my own gear for computer security, and I resent being forced to store any personal information to Intuit's servers. This is the first year that TT obliged me to login, so it's clearly possible to offer a product that doesn't force logins.<br />4. Every time I pass TT's checking steps, I'm nagged to buy AuditDefense. Once I've said no once, TT should stop nagging. Repeated unwanted upselling makes a brand look cheesy.<br />5. The same goes for nagging to store my taxes on Intuit's servers. Servers get hacked, so I want to minimize the number of copies of my taxes floating around. Once I've said once that I don't want cloud storage, stop nagging."
1,"First, let me say that if you have a small business, this is truly a very functional and robust product to help you keep track of so many things.  You have the ability to customize your products and services and your reports and if you need information, you have it at your fingerprints. I would recommend this and have recommended it to many small business owners.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is primarily the interface with gopayments.  After setting up all of our products and services, I realized they don't synch up with go payments so I have to input them into the app, too.  Which is PAINFUL and very annoying.  It should synch. It seems like such a simple thing that appears to be a big miss.<br /><br />Also, though you can add your custom logo to your invoice, you should be able to customize more than just that.  We have a particular company font and I wish we could add that.  It's a nit, but to have seamless communication including invoicing, we miss that.<br /><br />Otherwise, this keeps us organized - a great deal."
1,has always worked for us
1,easy to install
0,OK for very simple calculations with preset values. Variables cannot be modified.Would like to be able to modifiy the payment amounts to reflect accelerated principal payments or early pay-offs.
0,"I prefer the older versions of the included programs quite honestly. I don't like the way Word is setup compared to older versions. I know they were trying to streamline it to make it easier to use, but I think they failed users who are used to the older menu layouts. It ends up just being confusing having to figure out what you need to do to get to things that are no longer where they were. This combined with the frustrations of Windows 8, makes me want to write Microsoft and tell them they've taken a wrong turn. The download itself was great. Took a few hours, but that's due to my DSL connection. Installation was pretty painless, and I've had no issues so far aside from the annoyance at the learning curve."
0,really was not worth it for my systems even though it was free
0,NO MEDIA option.  Bad reviews and problems!!!  Purchase the 2010 if you can still get it.<br />Also no internet required to install 2010 & ONLY internet option to install 2013.
0,They charge extra. False Marketing!! I wish I wouldn't have bought this product and I highly suggest you don't either.
1,"I plan to be on the road a lot in the near future, so I decided to go with this server based accounting package. It works great for me and a bit simpler than my very old version of QuickBooks Pro.<br />The only downside is that you can't use it if you loose your internet connection."
0,"Utter disaster---downloaded it over two hours ago, and there is a bug in the install.  Three troubleshooting options provided, first two failed (after much drama following instructuions to the letter) so am now on option 3, which includes having to live chat with the Quicken customer service. I have been \\""number 1 in queue\\"" for live chat for over 20 mins....Disaster.  I hope Amazon will refund me.    *Update* I spent two hours with online support.  They finally just ran out of suggestions and started offering things that they offered up in the first 30 mins of the call.  It doesn't even seem like if I had the physical installation CDs it would make a difference.  Now getting my money back seems the least of my worries, I am completely stalled out.  Unbelievable that they would release a product with these known issues--don't get me started about the post-purchase survey I received asking me to rank my opinion as to whether quicken \\""cares about its customers\\"".  I'm not feeling it!"
0,"I was very disappointed that the Debt Reduction Planner STILL looks at the ENDING balance of an account instead of looking at the current balance. Many times i have 0% accounts with an expire date and I input all future payments in that account. Instead of using the CURRENT balance of the accounts, this version STILL looks at the projected balance of \\""0.00\\"" which makes it USELESS. It has been an ongoing issues that Intuit seems to not want to fix."
1,"Pros: Reasonable price; easy download, easy installation, (no issues found); easy to use;<br />Cons: only 1 state included, 2nd state price high. some items such as import, list is not complete.<br />Overall, very good SW and recommend it."
1,Great
1,"Before purchasing Office 2010, I had been getting-by with Open Office. At my workplace, we were using the full Office suite, so I had first hand experience before making the purchase. The software is definitely solid. So many things work just the way they should. Installation went without a hitch. The ribbon is powerful, useful, and customizable. The interfaces are pretty and well integrated with Windows 7. OneNote is incredibly handy and intuitive--alone worth the price of the Home and Student pack."
1,Will need it again in 2015 !
0,"I have purchased Quicken 2013 this week and I think it was a mistake. the product is buggy and hasnt been tested before releasing. I called customer support to get help with it, and the response was Quicken is feverishly working on fixing the bugs. Basic things dont work..<br />1. Quicken announced new feature online loan downloads. however, it shows wrong balances and wrong dates for next payment dues. and no way to correct it manually.<br />2. I get CL-501 erros, and the response from Quicken is we are fixing..<br />dont they test it before releasing?"
0,"I went with this for the price and reputation of H&R Block. I didn't see anything that made it better than Turbo Tax, and it cost more after getting the State and Federal pieces. I'm sticking with Turbo Tax."
0,"I am stuck with this product because it has all my past data.  However, the daily updating and many offers of additional services is time comsuming and annoying. Also, I find it difficult to find desired information from its help menu."
1,"so far i have had no problems with this software,it updates and stops any virus that has tried to come in so far. i hope it keeps doing a good job. i gave it 4 stars so far."
1,Saves a lot over tax preparers.
1,no comm
1,Its a great tool for us artist to make a living with.great for sketching with plus other kinds of styles.
0,It never. Work call Norton help after awhile they. Whated to sell me something else and it was<br /> 200.00 dollars very upset waste of money this was a new hp computer Should be no stars
1,"I bought this software after my boss recommended it to me when I was thinking of buying a new computer.  It works great! I love that I can customize everything that I want to transfer and leave all the unwanted stuff behind.<br /><br />The only thing I'd recommend with this software is getting the data transfer cable!! I tried it with the internet transfer first and it took 24hrs + and then it canceled out on me because my internet failed.  With the data transfer cable it took about 3-4 hours total.  You can do other things on your computer while the transfer is happening, just don't touch the transfer screen!! I clicked on the program app icon in the Windows 8 start screen and it stopped the transfer so I had to restart.  Other than the little hiccups (that were my fault completely) it was awesome."
0,offer was for an old expired version of Norton that I could not use or return.  Was a complete waste of money!
0,"I bought the TurboTax Deluxe install program from Amazon.com. It downloaded fine, but I get \\""Unable to extract files\\"" and it won't (can't) continue. When Win7 tested the software it was found incompatible with the operating system. I do not recommend purchasing this software for a Win 7 machine. My complaint is not with INTUIT but with Amazon for not providing a product I can use. And, if I knew how to tell Amazon so they could fix it (by either giving me a product I can use or refunding my money) I would not be writing this review."
1,Easy to install. Good price.
1,Works very well - long time user and the performance and new features (although limited) were beneficial.  Certainly like the easy way to monitor your credit rating.  Haven't found any severe bugs this far.
1,great buy.
1,works fast in the background - does what it is supposed to do - Amazon had a great price with download. Simple and fast download process.
1,"[Edited 3-12-2012] OOps- wrong product, posted for TTax2007 by mistake but meant for TTax2011. In eithar case, I rate both as 5-Stars."
0,Terrible design. Then need to get everything together.
1,"I saw your commercial on TV, and due in large part to being &#34;Made in the USA&#34;, I wanted to try your all-inclusive security solution.<br />Wow. After running it, my pc started up noticably faster with seemingly less &#34;confusion&#34; running in the background. My pc also runs probably 30% faster due to the various fixes and registry cleanups your software performed.<br />With Super-Shield Protection on, nothing gets through. Nothing. I had to change it to Prompt to let selective downloads through...<br />The only caveat is that it is always updating itself, which wakes my pc up often. Other than that, I have only praise for your product! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top-tier security/scrubbing solution!<br />Thanks,<br />Chris"
1,Avast has proven to be the best free antivirus software I've used. I have even chosen it as my Droid protection. It's easy to download and the updates are scanned often. Great program!
1,Norton 360 -- Works GREAT -- you should buy it -- I'm using HP Quad core Windows 7 -- I've had Norton for years -- always worked for me -- Norton is very reliable.
1,Product performs as good as or better than the costly antivirus programs. Have recommended to friends and family for their computers.
1,Excellent product!!
1,"I have used Avast Antivirus for over six years now and it works great.  It updates regularly and the price is right, it is free.  A friend who works on computers recommended this and used it on his own systems recommended this to me and I appreciate his recommendation.  Make sure you remove other anti virus programs if you use this or any other antivirus as two programs on the same system will conflict."
1,I was forced to upgrade from 2009 to keep accessing online banking info.  The download was flawless...the install was falwless and all systems seem to be working perfectly.  And Amazon had the best price.
1,"Been using for two years and no problems. Very thorough, quarantines virus's, cleans registry and tunes up P.C.. Great price on Amazon."
0,I used this software under the premis that I could Efile my State tax as well as Federal. When I got to the end I was asked to pay a fee to file the State Tax.
0,"Not only does it crash, but when it does, ALL your editing is lost - titles of slides, order of slides, any menu you created.  Technical support is much touted, but basically nonexistant.  The live chat is only BEFORE you buy it, and then not live, but a belated email response that doesn't answer your question.  Any other link to &#34;Technical Support Team&#34; only sends you to a search function that rarely finds the answer, and the &#34;Full Manual&#34; is just 4 basic steps, even though much of the information is somewhere?? because that's what is available when you search.  I found that most of the questions and problems I encountered simply trying to make a DVD of a trip were simply not answered.  If you create an account, you get no more help, but there is a link, called (for some unknown reason) &#34;Ticket&#34;, and here you can send off an email, which may or may not get answered.  There's no phone number, and the company is apparently located in Japan.  I was unable to add music period, or customize the menu in any meaningful way."
0,"I am glad I read these reviews about removing schedule D. I have been using Turbo Tax Deluxe for 20 years, but will be purchasing HR Block's product this year. What Product Manager or Marketing VP made this decision? Money always goes where it is treated best. Next year, expect either Intuit to correct their mistake or HR Block to follow Intuit's lead. This policy is so unbelievable that it is the first time I have ever reviewed a product on Amazon.<br /><br />I noticed a few years ago that the price jumped from $35 to $50 because they included the e-file as mandatory. They used to charge $15 for the e-file. This was probably mandated by the government as HR Block did the same thing at the same time. One of the IRS's mandates was to reduce costs by encouraging e-filing. After more research, Intuit along with other entities are funneling money to Congress against making the tax code easier and less complicated because that affects their revenue stream.<br /><br />http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/turbotax-maker-funnels-millions-to-lobby-against-easier-tax-returns/<br />http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing<br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2013/04/15/the-tax-complexity-lobby/"
0,"I had more difficulty converting to the 2014 version than any past years.  It could just be my lack of experience but, I have not had this experience in the past.  I use larger type font and I soon discovered that you need to reduce your font to successfully convert."
1,"Excellent for guided effects, layers and healing.  Used primarily for photo restoration and other adjustments I can not do in Lightroom, without shelling out the money for full-blown Photoshop."
1,"At this price level, it seems that each of the video manipulation/production programs have a forte, but none can do it all.  The interesting thing is that the price for this item rollercoasted up and down over weeks, so I tracked it and purchased it when it was right for me.<br /><br />I have used it now for about 2 years.  Easy to install and relatively easy to use upon getting familiar with it.  I say that, because each of these programs have their own way of operating, so the user needs to get used to each.  There's definitely nothing wrong with this one and I actually love it.<br /><br />What sold it for me was the HitFilm effects.  I checked the cost of a basic collection of HitFilm effects from HitFilm and purchasing this package came out better for me.<br /><br />It is a nice program with functions that become intuitive and actually make it easy for the user to operate.  I see this as a strong competitor to other video production packages, specially given the price.<br /><br />I produced one of my videos using it and using some HitFilm effects.<br /><br />Update (March 2017):  I still use and love this package (using version 13).  It's a mini Sony Vegas."
1,I moved from Turbo like a lot of others. This imported my 2013 Turbo data and was easier to use once you got use to the different prompting. Will use it again for the 2015 returns.
1,"I have used H&R Block for a few years of tax declarations. This one was very doable. It did have a couple of hang ups, but I was able to get past that fairly easily."
0,"I obviously bought this to learn QuickBooks, with which I had NO experience. The video is comprehensive and, if you can pay attention from beginning to end, you can probably turn around a teach someone else how to set up and run QuickBooks.<br /><br />I just wanted a basic understanding to get me started. I found after trial and error that using my laptop to &#34;play&#34; the video while I worked on my desktop was the best way for me to get any value out of the video rather than clicking back and forth between windows.<br /><br />Overall, I found the video a little boring and tedious, and I lost interest. My accountant showed me the basics of QuickBooks in ten minutes on my laptop in her office. For me, it turns out that sitting down with my accountant was a far better learning strategy for me. I doubt if I will refer to this product in the future..."
0,"Please don't but this product, too complex and the UI is painful!  Very confusing, I would definitely look elsewhere for your needs."
0,"they refuse to use clear, easy to understand language when advertising their products.Please be aware of hidden charges and the lack of covering all the topics most people will have when filing federal and state taxes"
0,"If you have windows 8, I would not purchase this product.  Chances are it won't work properly.  I installed it on 2 different windows 8.1 machines and ensured Net Framework was installed, still no go.  Also I searched high and low online and NOLO website but didn't find much help in how to get it to work.  Luckily Amazon refunded me my money.  Thank goodness I didn't have any prior returns.."
1,"It is good. Only note of caution.. Completely remove any other anti virus software  before installation.. If you do not, there are lot of issues..."
1,"This is a great product. I would give it 6 stars, if there were 6 to give. This software is used in a production environment and works every time, as you would expect. I have bought multiple copies for my employees."
1,"I successfully utilized the Quicken file conversion service to begin  my experiment with the Mac version.  I was initially a bit skeptical since the converted file was significantly smaller than the original one.<br />However, i must say that i am pleased with Quicken 15. It required (and still does) a bit of diligence to explore what and how it does various activities.  But it does do the job for me."
1,I am just totally satisfied. I have no issues with any virus attacks and I pray that I don't either. Norton's reputation is on point!!
1,"Like most programs from Intuit payroll is a simple and easy to use product.  Emails to remind you to run payroll, yse some of us forget, and to file and pay taxes.<br /><br />Great product at half the price of most of the services out there."
1,This was an upgrade of Quicken Premier 2010. I wanted a newer version to upgrade my capabilities as far as investment tracking and expense management. The product worked as advertised and was a reasinable value for the money.
0,"this is a piece of crap.  It took me three downloads till it would open, (error.... please download and try again)  then all I get is a \\""locker\\"" that is empty, if I want the actual math part...it wants me to purchase the program again.  For $1.99 this time.  I'm not going to pay more money when I haven't gotten what I paid for originally."
0,"This will be my last Turbo Tax and Quicken updates. Not only did I have to upgrade Quicken 2012 to the latest because Turbo Tax does not allow transferring the tax data from Quicken prior to 2013, but now I find that TT Deluxe does not support Schedule D info (transferred from Quicken!).  I'm fed up with the greed of this company, and I've had enough!"
1,"this is a basic and free program, upgradable as necessary.  It is phenomenal.  Constantly updating the virus database and stopping unwanted software malware intrusions."
0,"This has nice templates, but changed all my MS Office docs to OpenOffice!!!! Every time I opened Word it opened in OpenOffice format!!! Was not at all pleased!!!!"
0,I have not had time to use this program very much.  I bought it hoping I could transfer the picture in my first adobe photoshop to the new one but haven't had time to try
0,"Norton 360 slowed my computer down tremendously. It began immediately having problems locking up, screens freezing and I would spend hours shutting down and restarting my computer each day. Will not buy it or recommend it again!!!!!"
0,"Yeah, the program does what it is supposed to do - calculate your taxes.  But when you get done, you get nickel-and-dimed to death with added costs to do things like add another state and to e-file to those states.  No, you don't have to pay them to e-file (you can print it all out and mail it in) but you do have to pay them for any additional states.  In the end, I paid $64 for the program, but then had to pay $45 for an additional state (the additional state really costs them 70% of the original cost???) and $25 ($50 total) to e-file each of the two states for a total cost of $159.  I might have been able to take all of my receipts to H&R Block and have them deal with the aggravation for that cost."
1,It was easier to buy it here and pay a little than to download it for free from the manufacturer.
1,Worked.
1,"[[ASIN:B005S4Y3LU TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file 2011 for PC [Download]]]I've been using Turbo Tax since 2006. It makes filing taxes so easy. It automatically fills in the information from the previous year and asks questions so I don't forget anything. When finished, I file online. Never thought I'd do my own taxes.  I highly recommend it."
1,"I think AVAST Free is a great program and like everything about it except for the fact that it slows things down.  Sometimes, when I'm trying to do something, nothing happens.  I look down at my AVAST icon and, sure enough, it is working away at something.  Once it stops, I can resume at normal speed.  Although annoying, it isn't horrible and I have decided I can live with it for the security I get in return and especially for the price!"
1,Excellent program for mac.  I use it a lot. It also comes with templates for resume and so on.
0,"Because it appears difficult to transfer all data from prior years use of TurboTax into a competing product, I fear to stop using it.  This is doubtless part of their marketing plan.  But even if this is not the case, please note that one is literally prevented from adding in a capital loss or gain from a non-financial (reporting) institution in Deluxe.  One is forced to buy the Premier Deluxe upgrade because the designers will simply not permit any input of a capital gains transaction for which there is no institutionally issued tax statement; for that one is actually forced to upgrade at $40 and cannot buy the form used for this or even add in one's own data unless one buys the upgrade.  How many other &#34;gotchas&#34; or forced purchases exist?"
1,"Not sure of what all the fuss is about but I had absolutely NO PROBLEMS downloading this software. I paid, was directed to Microsoft to download but because I attend school online and am not issued a student email I &#34;almost&#34; encountered a problem verifying, however, I clicked the customer service link to start a chat and explained my dilemma and without even submitting any documentation I was issued a verification number and Presto!! I was good to go in less than ten minutes!! So don't be discouraged by all of the negative horror stories listed in these reviews (as I almost was). I'm so glad that I didn't let them cost me $120 over an issue that could be handled through the click of a button. The program works GREAT!  :D"
0,"works well for most of my needs, but generating roof lines is a pain. You will see if you order it that you are limited to very basic roof lines, the more complicated you try to make a footprint of the house, the more likely your roof line will be all sorts of messed up. But great for the floor plans."
1,my pc was slowing down now it is like new
0,"This download was done at least 5 times.  Each time you must re-verify by having you download over 1GB from Amazon.  You cannot try to reinstall what you just downloaded.  The you get a message that Photoshop Elements fails while installing shared technologies.  Their website tells you to rename a directory and try again.  I did, but it still failed with the same message.  It suggests you download a product that analyzes the log.  I tried that and the installation of that product failed too.  I chatted with their tech support and they suggested the anti-virus product might be preventing an install.  I turned off my Firewall and removed my antivirus and DID get it to install BUT once I started up the product it would not go into edit.  It simply displayed a barbershop style twirler which stopped to no effect.  When I changed my preference to go into edit once installed it refused to start at all.  Now I am no computer neophyte and have solved some very difficult problems but this is one of the worst I've seen.  It may not happen on every computer configuration but BEWARE."
1,"So far I think the program is pretty cool. I think most of the bugs are worked out by now that the earlier reviewers were talking about.<br /><br />Things to be aware of:<br /><br />1.) If you have a UBS \\""OneSource\\"" account though your company it will be a pain in the ass to link up. You have to get a dedicated ID and PW for quicken from UBS. Once it's linked up it works, however, if you have restricted \\""un-vested\\"" stocks it will not show up... I was disappointed in this regard.<br /><br />2.) If you have a Charles Schwab 401 though your company you will NOT be able to link it to Quicken. You will have to download the data from Charles Schwab manually.<br /><br />From what I've seen it has some cool features. Some of which I may use. I'll have to re-asses the program after the next tax term to see if it helps out."
0,"I purchased this product two days ago from Amazon (Order No. 106-5358814-0477834) and was directed to Office.com to download it to my laptop.<br /><br />I have tried several times, plus \\""Repaired Online\\"", only to be told over and over \\""Your download will start shortly.\\""<br /><br />Baloney, the only thing that has happened in my download folder is it's full of the same info (Setup.x86.en-US_HomeStudentRetail,and so on and so on) but bottom line, I have no program.<br /><br />Oh, but I have had Office downloaded up-teen times and a cherry note saying that I'm ready to go to work?????"
1,"Still getting used to it, but it is a huge improvement from v9 that I have been using."
1,Great product
0,I needed something now and cheap. Not a big fan of norton but my old av was expired and not worth what they wanted to renew. It's been adequate and not too annoying.
1,"feels trustworthy, worry free, i appreciate the prompts when a download is questionable."
1,I have been using TurboTax for years now. Makes tax time much less stressful. I recommend this to all those with basic returns.
1,i love this hotspot I have my ps3 my iPhone my wifes iPhone and a few other devices attached to it. it help because I use my brothers connection 3 appartments away. I recommend to everyone thanks for the service connectify.
0,They continue to omit forms that were once included. This is my last year buying ANY Intuit products!
1,Avast has my back.  I have the free version.  It saves me and prevents me from going to unsafe places.
0,"The 2013 can't compare to the 2010. Seems to me if it ain't broke don't fix it. When your used to performing tasks in a clear way and it changes, it cost time and patients."
1,"Seems to be a lot more nimble than IS 2014 so that works for me, Norton has always kept my computers free of viruses so I keep using it. To those who think Norton is too expensive I bought my renewal code from Amazon last week when it was on a deal for $19, hard to beat that. The other thing is what will it cost in time and money to have to get a virus removed by somebody else? Ounce of prevention..."
0,"I bought this to repair old photos, crop, remove unwanted background stuff..  it has no instructions with it, so if any of this can be done, I can't figure it out.  I see other books out there, but I think it's a shame you have to buy a separate book to explain how to use software you've purchased..  click on &#34;auto-repair&#34; it does nothing."
1,"If you know how to use this program it is a very good editor for sound files. If you don't have a clue you are one of the people who have written bad reviews.<br />This is a good editing program for voice over and music editing. You can build in overlaps for cross fades, assemble live performances, overlay things like applause and otherixing operations.<br />The LP ingest and noise suppression works well to remove pops and clicks.<br />This is not a multichannel mixing program so don't slam it for not being one. I have been editing audio, recording live performances and tightening them up to make CD's of for 15 years. It has served me well.<br />For those of you who know DOS commands like control C and control V, you can edit audio fromultiple files to a clipboard/file of selected takes using those commands. You can also zoom in and drop markers and then select regions between markers to quickly and repeatedly select desired sections of audio."
1,Highly rated security software that doesn't seem to bog down my PC.  The Amazon download is also a very good price.
1,I buy this product every year and these prices are terrific.
0,product will not install.  I want a refund.  i purchased the disc from amazon.  i want a refund for the download garbage.  Do I have to file a dispute with visa?
0,"I installed it once, it seemed that everything was better,but the next time I tried to open the internet it was not working, so I went back in time (restore) and when I tried to reinstall Kasperski I got a message telling me that the files are already there. custormer service send me to spend $249 or $229 and gave me two websites, which I don't want to use. So I'd like a refund, but it seems there is no way to get it."

0,I used Microsoft Publisher many years ago and the past three that I have HAD to change to I have hated! They have eliminated things each time they 'upgrade'. I am glad to see other ppl equally disappointed. I just couldn't believe that someone would actually continue to make a product worse over the years.
1,"Per my husband who does the taxes for over 17 years using turbo tax.  He's educated in computers, cameras, video etc...17 years of loyalty from him equals a 5 STAR RATING."
1,"Avast! is the anti-virus of choice in our household - it was simple to install, configures with ease, sits (mostly) quietly doing its thing. In conjunction with our Malwarebytes installation we feel our systems are protected."
1,There has never been any real issue .. keeps you updated and helps when you dont know what to do .. I love the product
0,"Download was not accepted on my desktop computer, probably because the computer had a Vista Windows program.  It was accepted on my laptop which has a Windows 7 program.  I would have liked a video tutorial in addition to the written one.  The tutorials on the internet are either fee based or difficult to understand because of narrator's accent."
1,I am just starting out but this product is great for the small business professional. I am still learning the ins and outs but it does everything I need it to do.
0,"I just bought this, and for some odd reason it asks for a product key, and I found out what I bought was only a trial. I look on my norton account in the product key section and it says the same thing &#34;trial.&#34; This is very disappointing. If I would had known it was a trial I wouldn't have bought it."
0,"I have used Turbo Tax for more than 10 years so I bought it again this year, but this year when I reached the deductions section i wanted to make me upgrade just to include the schedule A. Instead I purchased another program for $9.99 (less than 1/3 the cost of the upgrade on TurboTax) and did my taxes using the other program. I still got free electronic filing and a nice refund.<br />I'll never go back to TurboTax"
1,easy to use and compatible with most Microsoft applications.
1,I've been using AVAST Free for quite some time and it stands up to all to all of those other high priced ones.  I'll keep using this as long as they keep it.
0,"Regarding the changes made to Turbotax for 2014, I would like to thank all the reviewers that brought to my attention the game that Intuit was playing on their loyal customers...like me.  I bought the H&R Block Deluxe software this year as it has been very easy to use, I would recommend it."
0,"I have used Quicken for several years after MS Money disappeared. I don't update every year and I had the 2012 version but I wanted the Quicken mobile app for my iPad for travelling. I have just tested it for 2 months travelling in SE Asia. Conceptually it is OK but decidedly klutzy. Hence the 3 star rating. There are simple fixes that would improve it 100% - where are you Quicken???<br /><br />1. It only works when connected to the internet because it needs to sync right away - not always possibe in Burma for instance. This should be fixed so that it takes ones entries right away and then syncs when next connected.<br /><br />2, Why can't I enter check numbers if I use checks to pay bills from my bank accounts when travelling?<br /><br />3. Why can't I make transfers from one account to another as I do when at home on Quicken- for example paying a credit card account? Right now the only solution seems to be making two entries- a debit in my bank account and a credit in the CC account, marking them both \\""transfer\\""<br /><br />4. Where have all the full category and sub category decriptions gone? The mobile app pulls them up but if I for instance choose \\""TRAVEL with the sub category MEALS\\"" only meals appears --I need to know my travel expenses which is the way it works at home on the full version.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what happens to it all when I get back home and sync!!!"
1,Solid antivirus software for free. Easy to use. Seems ever vigilant. Updates are frequent and easy to install. Pretty much runs itself.
1,"Great, quick, easy, anyone can do it and get great tax return. It took just a little over an hour. Be prepared to pay for filing with the state, it's a separate charge of about $20"
0,"NOT FOR iPHONE or iPAD: As a pc norton user I made the ill-conceived assumption that it would be a good idea to add Mobile Security to my iPhone:  Bad move:  Leaning after the fact that the program adds NO VALUE to Apple iOS which already has the functionality that this software provides, I deleted the program, which left its vesitigial icon at the top of my iPhone screen- still working with Norton support to get that fixed."
1,"Photoshop Elements 13 isn’t exactly a consumer version of Adobe’s Photoshop CC (Creative Cloud). However, it’s wrong to think of Elements as a watered-down version of Photoshop. It’s easier to use, but its feature set is vast, very powerful, and does not require a subscription. Elements provides all of the editing capabilities most users will ever need.<br /><br />PSE13Box<br /><br />Year-after-year Adobe produces updated versions of Photoshop Elements that include incremental improvements and enhancements. Elements 13 has just been released and if you have not yet used Elements, now would be a good time to jump onboard. The Mac version now supports Apple’s Retina screens.<br /><br />This year, Adobe’s engineers focused on providing answers the frequently asked question, “How do I ________?” The resulting solutions work well. When a process is started, step-by-step instructions appear in a panel on the right side of the screen. New this year is Elements Live, called eLive, that occupies a fourth tab at the top of the screen next to Quick, Guided, and Expert editing modes. eLive is curated on Adobe’s servers and is updated frequently with tips, hints, how-tos, and news. It requires a live internet connection. Adobe plans to include eLive video tutorials in the future.<br /><br />eLiveScreen<br /><br />There are a few enhancements in Photoshop Elements 13. One popular editing task is selecting a person or object from a photo and pasting it into another photo. A new Photomerge step has been added, called Photomerge Compose. You can now select what you want to move using a new Refine Selection Brush. This tool allows much more precise selection than previous versions. Once the selection is pasted onto the target photo, the Match Color Tone feature can be used to make the selection match color notes and lighting.<br /><br />RefineSelection<br /><br />Another enhancement is a tool for converting your photos to black and white. There are three new Guided Edits: Basic black and white and a Color Pop process where you can isolate a single color and have it remain when the rest of the photo converts to black and white. The third and most useful step is a process for selecting a number of areas that will remain in color after the conversion to black and white.<br /><br />FiveHummersBW 2<br /><br />The Guided Edit section is now presented in a collapsed outline view to minimize screen clutter. The righthand pane contains just four expandable categories: Touchups, Photo Effects, Camera Effects, and Photo Play. Open one and you’ll see both the familiar and new Guided Edit tools.<br /><br />OutlneView<br /><br />I’m not a Facebook fan, but a new feature in Elements 13 provides ways to combine cover and profile photos with graphics, and typography and post them directly to your Facebook page from within Elements.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements 13 again includes the Organizer module. You can grant access to your photo library, folders, or other photo files so the the Organizer will show you thumbnails of your photos. From the Organizer, you can open any photo that you see. While use of the Organizer is not required, it is available as a useful option.<br /><br />Pre13Box<br /><br />Adobe has also updated Premiere Elements. It does for video editing what Elements does for still photography. They both share the same Organizer module so that thumbnails of your photos and video clips are available. Premiere Elements 13 contains a variety of enhancements including a Favorite Moments trimming feature that greatly reduces the time required to edit and cut the best section from each each scene. Adobe includes a welcome new a Shake Stabilizer that automatically enhances and calms wobbly hand-held sequences.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements 13 and Premiere Elements 13 are each $99.99 from Adobe. They are also available from many online retailers. Upgrades from the previous version are $79.99. The Elements/Premiere bundle is $149.99 andthe upgrade is $119.99.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements belongs on your Mac as it will quickly become your photo editor of choice. It’s user friendly at the outset and as you become familiar with its many features you’ll begin to realize how powerful it is. I give Photoshop Elements a consistent 10. Photoshop Elements 13 is a reasonable upgrade but isn’t absolutely mandatory if you already have the previous version. If you are not yet an Elements user, this version is a perfect starting point. It’s full-featured, stable, and you’ll be thrilled with the results.<br /><br />MyMac Review rating is 9 out of 10. (Only if you are on the fence about Elements 13 being an essential upgrade from 12. If you are new to Elements, it rates a solid 10.)<br />http://www.mymac.com/2014/09/photoshop-elements-13-review/the upgrade is $119.99.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements belongs on your Mac as it will quickly become your photo editor of choice.

1,"Good value, easy to install"
1,"Avast is not only very user friendly, but is a wonderful program for new to the net people. I'm fairly new to the net and find myself in all kinds of objectionable places,lol. Avast catches everything though. I would definatly recomend it to anyone looking for virus protection on their pc or portable devises,"
1,"I have used Norton for many years and this is by far my favorite Norton product. It did not take long to download. Installing the Amazon downloader was a bit of an inconvience but once it's downloaded, it's easy to download future orders. The best part of Norton Internet Security is the Identity Safe. Identity Safe stores all your passwords and makes it easier to access. Everytime I turn on my computer I log into Identity Safe using one password, then anytime I visit a website, the log in's are automatically filled in. Using this has saved so much hassle with having to remember so many passwords, it makes everything easier and makes the whole experience that much better. The antivirus runs in the background and you never really know it's there. I would reccomend this product to anyone!"
0,I was using microsoft security essentials earlier and and i think it was better than this
1,love it
1,"I easily installed this program a month ago. I knock star off because itis a forced upgrade by Quicken in order to continue to download transactions from financial institutions. It  imported correctly my old transactions. I use only the checking/savings account features, so I cannot comment on all the other aspects of this program.  It works on Windows 7 and Windows 8 correctly for me."
1,"So far so good. It is an improvement, but when I am expecting it to auto-fill a line or a check, it seems not to be doing that. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, so I'll work more with it to see."
0,"I purchased this program assuming that, like competitor Mint, this program would have the ability to access all of my online accounts. I was shocked to find that this program lacked access to many of my banks and credit cards. Upon this realization I contacted Amazon to request an exchange to software which actually worked. Amazon never responded. BE WARY OF THIS PRODUCT."
1,Better than I expected
0,"As a user of Quicken Windows for well over ten years, I can tell you that this product is horrible. Rather than list the dozens of ways it's inferior, just trust that it will take extra keystrokes to do anything, and many features are just plain AWOL. I've given up managing my investments on Quicken and just use it to balance my checking account and credit cards, and even there it sucks. The reconciliation process is infuriating, and it takes multiple clicks just to enter a transaction. Making a payment has extra fields for no good reason. And when I went to delete all of the securities from my account since I gave up on them, it won't let me. Even worse, it insists on updating their prices, which takes forever, and there's no way to turn it off. I'm desperately seeking an alternative, but QuickBooks for Mac, which I also use for my business, is awful, too."
0,The product is more difficult to use compared to it's preceeding versions.  Primarily due to it's added functions.  I believe that after using the product for awhile I will become more accustomed to it's features.
1,Very satisfied
1,"I've used McAfee Internet Security on my computers the past few years and have been very happy with it, no complaints! It does what it's suppose to and I feel protected. I usually purchase the retail card version but it wasn't available. This time I purchased the 'online code' version of this product, by which they send you the product key via email right away. Nice!"
1,I find that Quicken 2015 works very well.  It is faster loading than the last version and it's features are great.
1,"Just what you need for detailed, organized for all business categories to record what's going on. Get it! Amazing n useful tool"
0,"If you want to electronically file your state return, you'll be surprised with another $25 fee after you've finished all the work of filling out all the forms. It is dishonest."
1,My wife installed  this to keep my computer a must do to protect our stuff. It was very easy to install.
1,"TurboTax refugee here.  I'm using Block this year after 7-8 straight years of TT because of Intuit's pricing antics<br /><br />Import from TT 2013 was flawless.  So was installation.  I have a Windows 8.1 machine.<br /><br />The download from Amazon of the main program was stop go stop and took 30min to 1 hr to complete.  Amazon's issues, not Block's. Just minimize the download Window and let it keep running lest it drive you crazy.  It will complete."
0,Does add features that support price to upgrade from older version.
0,"I purchased this and had nothing but problems with it right from the start! I strongly advice people to purchase this elsewhere and NOT download it right from Amazon! Seriously, I downloaded it and still couldn't use it so I had a friend come over to try to help me out and they at least got it to work 'at first' but then when I tried to use it again another time, it wouldn't even LET me use it and it said that my TRIAL was over so to be able to USE it, I would have to pay for it again!  Yeah, right...I don't think so! IT WASN'T A TRIAL! Sooo needless to say... I ended up uninstalling it (since it didn't work anyway) and now I will repurchase it but I will definitely be BUYING it outright instead of trying to go thru Amazon! Please, Trust me here, don't waste your money like I did... purchase it elsewhere!"
0,"Turbotax for Mac works Ok. In fact they even upgraded to premier in the app at no additional cost.  What really bugged me is that the return cannot be saved with password protection unless you create an Intuit account. This is purportedly to help people remember their password. Well, give the people a chance to decide if they need your help. Not keeping  sensitive info on the cloud is one of the reasons I opt for desktop software instead of online version.<br /><br />This is a really troublesome and unnecessary requirement"
1,"Very reasonable price, and I saved several dollars over renewing it directly with Norton.  I've used this product for years and really like it."
0,I was unable to download so I will not pay for it. Disappointed as this is the second year in a row this has happened and I am somehow going to cancel the charge.<br />IC
1,"Half the price of nortons upgraded offer at their site. And if you already have Norton 360, just use the key number they give you after purchase and skip the download process..Pull up your horton to upgrade/ put in #/ and it is all but instant..very happy with Norton Protection. We have a Laptop that has had no problems in 3 1/2 years...fast as day I bought it and we use it a lot as our desk top computer."
0,"Less than one star would be appropriate.  I bought this program directly from MobileTrans, and wasted $19.95 of my hard earned money.  After installation, I followed the instructions fro opening the phone's USB port via the Developer's options instructions (Samsung 5G), and then installed and ran the program.  All seemed to be going well, until the actual transfer failed.  NOTHING transferred to the phone from iTunes, although all songs from my iTunes account was showing.  Even tried as little as 10 songs, without success.  then I turned to the &#34;support&#34;, and they responded to my initial request for help with reasonable questions (asking fro screen shots, sending log files), but immediately their server REJECTED my responses.  BE CAREFUL!  I cannot speak to a phone-to-phone transfer, but just a warning that if you need ANY customer support, you may not get it.  All support and product is from China.  Worst purchase I've made for awhile."
1,After a few months the program starts to freeze?
1,I was flying from SLC to Orlando and needed to edit some word files and noticed the new Mac Pro I just purchased did not have word software.  I searched different websites and found Amazon to be the one that could deliver it over wifi immediately.  So I purchased it and downloaded it over the Southwest Wifi network.  It finished downloading just as the Captain informed us of our decent into Orlando... Whew just in the nick of time.  I was able to complete my install and meet my deadline.
1,i recommend norton to any body guives me piece of mind i fiell secuere i trust the product excellent keeps my computer working smood
1,"[[ASIN:B007BG9Y44 Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 Student and Teacher Edition]]I used LR4 with Windows and it worked well.  If you try to use the Mac edition with Mountain Lion, it shuts down iPhoto and locks up your photo files.  Efforts to recover the files caused some corruption of iPhoto.  It just leads from one incompatibility to a really serious problem.  Amazon, it seems, does not offer any refund options on this download. An expensive mistake!<br /><br />After further review, I have raised my rating of Lightroom.  Everything I said is true, but once I updated Lightroom to the latest revision, all of my photos on all drives were retrieved by Lightroom.  The four star rating is due to the learning curve, but the software is performing as it should."
1,"It got the job done, but their support stinks. They don't know anymore than you."
1,This is my second PC Matic license.  I have no issues because of this great software and I fully support this American owned company.
0,"Do not purchase this. I'm a designer and artist with my own small business. I got tired of using Excel spreadsheets and thought Quickbooks would make life easier. I have use Quickbooks for PC in the past before I had my own business. Quickbooks for Mac is horrific. I can't even use it because every time I try and import a file or upload any information my QB crashes. The PC version allows you to create inventory for saleable items, but NOT the Mac version. I even asked a community forum question regarding inventory tracking and was misinformed. You cannot track inventory components and then add them into an inventory piece for sale. $200.00 down the toilet because this is a software purchase and understandably cannot be returned. Do not buy this."
0,I've used Quicken for decades. Starting with Quicken 1.0.<br />Yes Quicken and Quickbooks is great.<br />My last purchase was Quicken 2012.<br />We keep track of our expenses and investments.<br />I was very disappointed when my Online Banking started to not function.<br />It kept getting an error when downloading my transactions.<br />I complained to the bank and lo and behold they told me to keep that functionality I HAD to upgrade to Quicken 2015.<br />All the new features are lost on me as I never need to do anything but write checks and make deposits.<br />This is just another way Corporate America is squeezing us for that extra nickle and dime so that they force you to upgrade.<br />This is my review and I'm sticking to it (and them).
1,"One of my favorite tools, it works perfectly... I am now able to watch videos from years ago on my tv thanks to this converter..."
1,"i downloaded for my mac mini (which i purchased this year so it's a newer machine).  downloaded just fine and it continues to update whenever intuit puts out a new update.  This is my first year to use turbo tax on a mac.  but i'm now new to turbo tax, been using it for pc for the past 10 year (or maybe longer).  Always happy with turbo tax."
1,Works as advertised. I was able to add programs that I could not use with the Home edition. No problems with it.
1,Great as always
0,Awful... This is a product designed for people who don't know better and want the illusion of effectiveness..  Scheduled scans over use resources to the point a making the machine unusable for  any other purpose even on a fairly high end machine.  There is no way to cap or throttle resource usage at run time.  Configuration options are childish in there simplicity.  Default settings are irresponsible.  Defragmentation is turned on by default with no detection of SSD drives which should not be defragmented.
1,"Unless you truly have a VERY unusual return, this program is the way to go.  I have investment, savings, and checking accounts.  I have a mortgage and charitable donations.  Additionally, I have a son in college.  This handled it all very well"
1,Got the license key just fine. Plugged it in and the software worked. Quick and easy setup. Had the trial version so the software was already installed. Just had to update the license. Everything works great.
1,I thought that the lessons were very helpful.  My onlu complaint is that the scoring system was a little confusing.  Otherwise I would recommend it to anyone trying to increase their typing speed.
0,"Did not do what I wanted, and put in things I had not planed. It took me a while to get it out of my system."
1,This program was quite useful. I bought it primarily to edit PDF house plans but slowly have been using it for photos.  The learning curve is LONG and FRUSTRATING but you will get there.<br /><br />Biggest drawback is I didn't realize that I couldn't install it on all three of my PCs which would have been REALLY nice since we often would sit in living room with our laptops but wanted it on our main PC.  Adobe absolutely refused to extend a third installation to us (even though I said I would pay $$s for it) and basically just said - buy it again. I would have paid more for a third setup - but not the whole amount again !<br /><br />We set up REMOTE DESKTOP so we could run it from one PC via another - not as ideal but it sufficed.
0,"Product stuck in constant loop trying to update to current version release.  After 2 calls with level 1 support with H&R Block, no resolution.  They escalated twice to level 2 with promises of 48 hour call back form level 2, and zero calls back.  Terrible support structure with their customers, and level 2 and level 1 do not even communicate together to discuss problem logs.  I specifically asked this question when discussing with a supervisor.  This software is a joke.  Bad code and worse support."
1,I have used Quicken for years and this version does not disappoint!  I recommend it to anyone who wants to easily track their finances.
1,"I love this, i did have issue downloading due to quick time but after i install and restart it works.<br />i only need it to improve my accent or pronounce. the fact that this software has a gauge that show the different between native speaker and myself. It's simple but it works. it compared my voice with the native speaker i just kept trying until my gauge to to the native speaker side. just what i need. Thank you so much."
1,excellent never had a virus since installing avast 6 years ago
1,Very easy to use and navigate through.  The system asks many yes and no questions which helps you select the correct choice.
0,It never loaded. Therefore a fix is needed by the creator.
1,"Improvements are great.  But!  It would be very helpful to have a reverse button in the event a transaction is deleted.  In particular in brokerage accounts.  Q does not process reorganizations effectively and gives instructions that are wrong in the final analysis, e.g., indicating a transaction should be deleted when in fact deleting the transaction information is lost completed and having the effect of changing the cash within the account.<br /><br />It would be helpful if Q software developers talk with brokerage firms to understand complex transactions with stocks.  Over the years, this has improved, but it still need more work."
1,"I used the earlier version of Quicken for Mac until I was forced to upgrade to Quicken Essentials.  I am glad to be back with Quicken.  Although being a creature of habit, I would prefer that the new version was more like the old.  I have not yet fully explored all the features, but the ones that I have used have been straight forward and easy to use.  I mostly use the basic functions and I've had no problems.  I like being able to know daily where I am financially.  This program allows me with little effort to do that."
1,So far work good.
0,"Update to 3 stars: 10/22/2015 I have purchased a new Mac. I personally didn't have any issue with Corel. I actually like it pretty well. But I work with other photographers and clients that are Adobe people. So I gave it another attempt. Downloaded the Creative Cloud and it installed. I was very surprised and relieved. Perhaps they have fixed some bugs.<br />This was a 1 star review, and I am upgrading it to 3 stars for now. I will update this review in a few months after I see how things work with this cloud. So far so good. I am leaving my initial review below that was 1 star just so people can see how things may go on the bad end.<br /><br />Update still 1 star: 3/17/2015 After 2 hours on customer service 1 month ago and cancelling the account, they just charged me again! The man i'm on the phone with from India told me it would take him 3 minutes to review my account. It's now almost 10 minutes! I'm still on hold right now! So you go through the whole process of using the trial for 30 days. You then purchase this wonderful deal for $9.99 a month. If you have a Mac like me be careful. I couldn't get the Adobe cloud to accept the fact that I paid for Lightroom and Photoshop. I contacted customer support after I had read many web pages of people talking about the same exact problem but no fixes. Customer support told me over and over to click the link that says &#34;license this product.&#34; Oh wait, there was no link to be found. After almost 2 hours with customer support I got a refund. The whole process of being screwed took about 2 days. No tutorial or documents to walk you through a problem that i all over the internet!? All I'm saying is either purchase the CD-Rom version or don't get it. Adobe Cloud is the worst product marketing platform I have ever dealt with."
1,As always a good product
1,Very simple to use. I have not had to use on the online help sources. It's great if what you want is a checkbook on your computer.
1,"I've been using Quicken since 1996 and have upgraded it every three years.  This was the smoothest upgrade ever.  It kept everything I use pretty much the same as 2012.  There was no learning curve or having to realign my printed checks or digging through all the menus.  Since I've been using for nearly 20 years, it goes without saying I love the product and would have no qualms about recommending it."
0,"The advertising for this product is extremely misleading...it is NOT Photoshop.  It is nothing more than a fancy file manager; it does not allow you to &#34;photoshop&#34; anything.  It was a waste of both time and money.  If all you want is a photo file manager, do yourself a favor and look into ACDSee, a much better (and less expensive) product."
0,So many news stories about problems with it.  Hopefully I won't have any.  Maybe next year I'll try something else.
1,I have been a Quicken user for a long time (since 1994)and love using it.  I was using 2010 Deluxe version and learned that I could no longer download my transactions without upgrading (what's up with that???) but like being able to do that and is almost a necessity now so I decided to get the 2013 Deluxe version (downloaded) and install.  Hopefully I'll be able to to use this version for several years. I didn't have any problems converting my 2010 data to 2013 and was up and running again in just a few moments.  I love being able to maintain the several accounts I have and can switch between accounts with just a click.  There are many nice features about Quicken but for me I really love being able to reconcile my accounts so easily which used to be a real pain.  I'm not a real hard user so I don't make use of all the features but it works very well for me and is well worth the cost to keep track of things.
1,A great program and it is free.
1,This was quick and easy to install and I am not by any means great with computers!  It is also so much cheaper than ordering straight from norton
1,"Turbotax has a $25 rebate if you used it last year and this and bought the permier. Between buying on Amazon, that rebate and the 10% bonus you can't beat it."
1,I purchased Office Home and Business using the product keep and it worked the first time!  Wow!  I was so happy that it was so easy.  Love it too!
1,"Unfortunately I am not very good with using the computer and Avast helps me feel secure with my emails, posts, etc.<br />really enjoy using many programs and being alerted when I might have a problem is great.  Thank you."
1,"My son really enjoyed a photo editing class that he took in his high school. I wanted to feed his new found creativty, and took advantage of the student pricing. He uses the program all the time."
0,"I was mistaken that the program would be exactly like the typical, everday word perfect program that my son could use for his online courses. Sadly, the program was not compadable with the online courses (wouldn't transfer correctly to the teachers program which became a big pain to try and fix). I landed up wasting money on a program that never gets used. I am sure it is suitable for some but I should have reviewed the program more closely before I purchased it."
0,ruined my computer i was so naive i thought it was a symantec product so it couldnt be bad i installed it did the deep registry defrag half way through the scan my computer freezes and it stays like that for an hour then i turn it off and turn it back on when i turn it on i come to find out everything on my hard drive was deleted meaning everything i had on my desktop is now all gone thanks to this little demon . this thing is truly the worst virus on the planet stay away from at all cost !!!!
1,I'm a home user who wanted a good video editing package without paying for features that an amateur like me will never use. This absolutely fit the bill.
1,Much faster and more templates. I do wish there was a way to share more than one Mac if you decide to get a laptop and I just purchased one download. Thumbs up.
0,"Be very careful, this year's version of Deluxe has stripped out several key schedules (C/D/E).  You will need to buy upgrades to either Premier or Home&Business.<br /><br />I used Deluxe version for at least 15 years.  Always had the necessary forms and schedules for me until this year.  They did publicly say they are sorry and After you buy the upgrades and After you file your return, they will give you a twenty five dollar rebate for your time and expense.  Its like ordering the combo meal for years at the drive through and then getting home and finding that fries are not included anymore.  Check out what you need before you buy."
0,i had this for about a month now and all i can say is that its crap. it takes forever to scan my computer if it even opens the program. and thats the other thing it wont start up it keeps saying loading the application and then stops and closes the program. save your money...
1,Simple and fast.
1,"Avast is easy to use and understand. I am  very happy with the performance of Avast, it is a great way to protect personal information. I highly recommend it."
1,"Every year, it seems to be fairly easy to do my own taxes with this software."
0,"I got &#34;upgraded&#34; to Office 365 at work (a large university). What a piece of crap software! I clicked on a calendar link in an email and it changed the date and time. I tried to cancel. It informed the people who had mysteriously also been connected to the link. I went in and tried to set a new calendar entry for the meeting. It said the right day and time. I clicked ok. It reverted to a meeting at 11:30 p.m. and automatically sent this info out to a bunch of people whom I had not invited. (I got a lot of WTF replies and looked very unprofessional). The interface makes the old Outlook seem like a graceful gazelle. Clunky, hard to navigate, old outlook folders mysteriously disappeared, nonfunctional features. I am a long-time apple user, and I have to say that the ethos of Microsoft has NEVER WAVERED. It is run by, designed by, serviced by a bunch of engineers and robots without a single awareness of how humans actually work on computers. Their software is ALWAYS unintuitive, awkward, ugly. But this? This is even worse than usual, as it has finally reached the level of unusable. And my workplace didn't give me a choice. I'm thinking of forwarding the entire mailbox to gmail. (By the way, I used to run a computer network for an entire newspaper, and have a high level of knowledge and experience. I'm an expert-level user and teacher of Quark (yay!), Indesign (ugh, so bad) and photoshop.) And yet, whenever I have to add section breaks to a word document I end up curled up on the floor in the fetal position sobbing like a baby. And now my email, with which I correspond with the 150 students I'll teach and advise this semester, is UNUSABLE."
1,"If you are a Quicken user, you will love this continued great product."
1,"VIPRE antivirus killed my product key so i had to get a new antivirus, saw this and was skeptical at first. i bought it and scanned with it and it wiped all the viruses off my computer, i also has a quick defragger,it has a PC optimiser,i has so much great stuff to run your pc better. I love it and i hope others will too. plus your saving money, iobit sells this on there website for $50. this is one hell of a steal. if you hate viruses and your computer is slow, BUY THIS NOW."
0,the server sucks<br />auditions from good to bad<br />the major proplem is the activation server<br />and phone activation sucks 2
1,"Poser is a really difficult program to learn simply because it is so powerful and filled with options and tools that are arcane at best and hopelessly confusing at worse.  Without this course, it would be hopeless.  This series of tutorials is enough to get you going, but not enough to make you an expert.  I assume that nothing but practice, practice, practice....."
1,I called AVG & they actually took control of my laptop (after I gave them permission of course) and remotely installed the software for me. I give AVG a big thumbs up!
0,Not what I'm looking for in an invoicing software. I didn't evening install the program on my desk top. If you are looking for a three month subscription online. Its a good program. I needed a program that I am able to use offline.
1,"The latest version of Quicken has addressed many issues from Quicken 2014. Along with Quicken cloud and the mobile app, keeping track of my finances has never been smoother. Even better the new version let's you combine all Intuit passwords into one so there is not a need to remember your data password, one step update password and Intuit password separately."
0,"I did the upgrade as I was still using 2010 and figured three years time was long enough. I did a backup of old data and then installed upgrade. For some reason, when I went to reconcile with bank statement, it had data from three months back that was already reconciled. A minor pain, I guess.<br /><br />My big gripe is the toolbar. Maybe I am missing something but the older one was more intuitive, unless the new one requires me to set one up myself and make it my own design, I don't know. It's very frustrating to learn one way of doing things and then \\""upgrades\\"" force your workflow to follow a new path. I don't care much for the new layout, either."
1,It is dependable and easy to use.<br />I recommend to other people very well.<br />Very good antivirus.<br />Always maintains my PC clean.
0,"Total waste of money.  Software did not handle a routine basic filing issue.  Provided a cryptic confusing error with no support.  &#34;Since you received employer-provided care for your children or dependents, you cannot e-file your tax return.  You'll have to file a paper return.&#34;<br /><br />Wound up purchasing TurboTax which more than paid for itself."
0,"I can't get audio to import at all no matter what format I convert it into, none are supported on anime studio."
1,"Of course, unless one is a techy that can truly &#34;see&#34; if the software is really doing something, we can only guess that the software is doing its thing.  I like this because it seems to have little to no affect on the speed of this machine with little memory & little speed to begin with.  Like I said before, it truly runs in the background with no hassles.  The &#34;upgrade&#34; reminders are aggravating at times, but for free, I understand."
1,Works great. Cannot change style. To an earlier version of Word. Looks a little different than a regular Microsoft Office program.
1,"I been using this product for the last 10 years I never ever have any issues, my computers are working fine I have 5 computers in my home all running fine."
1,"I am very happy with Avast, I have had it on all of my computers for years.  My son the computer whiz recommended it to me.  I've never had trouble with a virus or bug. And guess what, it's free!"
0,"This feels like something a company puts out when they want to use the  &#34;serve our customer better&#34; line. When you hear that, run away. It only means you get less for more. I have been using TurboTax Basic since they bought out Parsons way back when (my old tax program) and have been mostly happy with Intuit. I even started using Quicken. This year with TurboTax changes and what has happen to Quicken, my loyality to Intuit has changed. The sorry for our mistake is to little to late. I moved over to H and R Block this year and couldn't be happier. Mostly because it is a good alternative and it works just fine. Good by to the cocky TurboTax attitude that we are the one and only. This change really opened my eyes.<br />I will be on the lookout for a good alternative to Quicken. I have lost all confidence in Intuit that they even care about their customers. Again another company with only themselves in mind."
1,Great price and really helps with my taxes
0,"The previous year's version included rental income Sch E, which is now moved to Premium. A message with a link offering free upgrade led to an online payment demand."
0,I HAVE BEEN USING QUICKEN AND TURBOTAX FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  WAS USING TURBITAX 2004 AND VERY HAPPY WITH IT. IN TRANSITION ( ON-LINE)  TO QUICKEN 2013 I HAVE DISCREPANCY IN BALANCES ON ONE ACCOUNT.  HAVE TRIED TO GET SUPPORT FROM QUICKEN AND GET NOTHING BUT A RUNAROUND. MAY BE OTHER GLITCHES WHICH<br />I HAVE NOT FOUND BUT IT BUGS ME THAT SUPPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE .
0,"As a professional artist/photographer, I had been using Photoshop Elements version 3 for many years. It was wonderful, with no issues whatsoever. I recently had to get a new computer which then required I get an up-to-date Photoshop Elements 12. This new version is totally idiotic or maybe I'm just stupid. It looks to me as if they intended this only for moms and pops jazzing up snapshots of the kids and printing them out at simple standard sizes. This version refuses to save any dimensions I enter for doing repeat orders for art prints under their \\""Custom\\"" setting. The older version not only saved everything but it also provided a constraint feature that showed the actual measurements. This new version doesn't. I absolutely hate this new version. It is taking me endless hours longer to print through this program. I will have to find something else. Sorry Adobe, but you goofed."
0,Junk. Do not buy!!! Will cause more problems that you already have.
0,Federal return processed without problems. State return is inaccessible without paying more money.  What is going on with all this?
1,A very complelte finantial system with many features that make it intuative and easy to use.
1,"Excellent! Did exactly what it was supposed to,  and user friendly as well!"
1,There were so many changes in the program that I had a hard time finding some things and it was hard to find how to print out the state tax return if you did not file it electronically. However it is still an easy way to do one's taxes and I plan to use their program again in the future.
0,"As a long time MS Money user, I was forced to convert to Quicken when Microsoft discontinued that software. Quicken promises an \\""easy\\"" import of your old data. Numerous incompatibilities, however, make this all but useless. After importing the data, Quicken said that my checking account had $100,000 more than was actually there! I suspect that this is because it doesn't support investment accounts, so old transactions to those accounts don't show up. It seems that it would be easy to preserve at least the withdrawal values so you get the starting balance right! I'm just getting started, and I suspect that it will be an ok package on its own, but lack of real support for MS Money users seems silly."
1,"Cook’n is without a doubt the best recipe software on the market !! I have been using Cook'n since the onset and the way the cook'n team and Dan have grown are just AMAZING!!! This product just keeps getting better and better!! I am soo excited about Cook'n 12 ! The iphone app is fantastic and getting better and better with every update!! I don't know what I would do without Cook'n My recipe catalog is massive ! For those of you who need a recipe organizer and much much more, look no further! Cook'n is the only one you will ever need! Congratulations to Dan and the whole Cook'n Team !! Keep up the great work!<br />Forever Greatful<br />Sandy Farina"
1,Ordered this on Amazon as it was less expensive to buy a new license than to renew my old one... kind of dumb.  Wasn't too difficult to just switch to the new license number and felt it was very worthwhile in cost savings!  AVG does and excellent job of protecting my info.
0,"I cannot capture anything without it skipping ever so slightly, but enough to make it annoying."
0,Did the marketing folks really think removing a key feature was a good thing?  Did they think Deluxe users just wouldn't notice .  Really?  Does anyone know if you can import prior year data from TurboTax Deluxe into H&R Tax Premium?
0,"I bought this Adobe product because I have gotten into photography and needed a photo editing program but I should have known better. I was in the printing industry for over 20 years and (in my opinion) found Adobe Photoshop products to be way over complicated but I took a chance on Lightroom and found that Adobe has not changed one bit. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5 is no different overly complicate with lousy instructions.<br />I even ordered a book on Lightroom 5 but when it arrives I am going to send it straight back so I can get a refund.<br />To Adobe simple is BETTER, complicated SUCKS. So maybe one day you might wake up and make your Photoshop programs far less complicated and in the mean time I have decided to see if I can sell my copy of Lightroom 5.<br />My review is NOT for the download version, my review is for the hard copy version, the version that was mailed to me in a box with the CD, why Amazon shows me reviewing the download version I do not know but they are wrong and I am right as usual  :}<br />But that still does not change the fact that this program as with all versions of Adobe Photoshop are overly complicated."
0,"I have been a quicken user for a very long time.  I love that it makes balancing the checkbook easy and accurate.  I am not happy that this version (and 2014) continually goes blank on the screen, especially when I am balancing an account.  I have to close it and open again.  Fortunately, I do not have to start over.  It is frustrating though.  I do not usually upgrade every year, but I wanted to this year as I thought the blank screen would be resolved.  No so.  I have tried all the tricks recommended on the web and none have worked.  Even with this frustration I will continue to use Quicken."
1,Avast keeps my computer free of viruses and I like it.  I have used others in the past.  They didn't do as good as job.
0,"I like Quicken. Except for the online banking function, though, I don't see that the last version is better for me than the first one. The company has simply found a new profit source, threatening customers with loss of online banking without an expensive upgrade. I wish there were a good alternative."
1,Very easy to use. A truly great accounting package. Have been using it for over ten years.
0,"Trial period only<br />Bought this product in good faith, for 30 bucks I'm being told its a trial period of 30 days!! Complete ripoff!!"
0,"May 4 - I received an email from Amazon.com that issues related to the map update codes had been resolved.  At 9:15 this morning, I started the download of the map update . . . 6 hours later, the download was complete.  It took another hour for the files to extract and actually update the device.  All in all, lots of frustration but problem resolution after 48 hours.    May 3 - I should have listened to the other reviews where people were having problems!  I got an email from Amazon offering this great deal on the one time map updates.  After purchasing, I went to the Garmin site, tried to activate the code that was provided and got an error message saying \\""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again. If difficulties persist, contact Garmin Product support for assistance.\\""    Similar to others, I called Garmin to get a recording that hold times were running 30-35 minutes.  I was on hold for about 17 minutes before I got a live rep and after describing my problem, he came back on the line to tell me that Garmin is aware of the problem and that the tech department is working to correct it.  I asked for a timeline and he said, just try your code again in a couple days.  I asked if they could provide me with a valid code or one that wasn't having technical issues but again, similar to other users - they said I would have to contact Amazon.  The Garmin rep had to the nerve to say \\""since you got it so cheap, can't you just wait a couple more days?\\""    I am very disappointed at both Garmin and Amazon - don't push products when there are technical issues with the product and reps are not able to communicate resolution timelines or provide any meaningful assistance!  I would not recommend purchasing this product until you see consistent (recent) feedback that technical issues have been resolved."
0,I haven't been able to get on the computer internet since it was installed
1,First time buying downloadable program.  Easy to download and install.  Very satisfied with Norton's security and updates.  Great product--would buy download product again.
1,Did exactly what I needed and it was pretty easy to figure out. Worked with my banks software too so I could directly download my statement right into quickens software. Easy and convenient
1,"Having to learn a new program is always frustrating especially if you're used to the old one, but I'm glad I had to upgrade, the changes in this version make it much more user friendly once you get the hang of it."
0,"I've been a loyal user of Quicken ever since Quicken has existed.  A couple of years ago I switched to an iMac for probably the same reason everyone else switches from Windows-based PCs.  I had to install Parallels on my Mac, solely for the purpose of being able to continue to use Quicken.  I thought it would be great if Intuit would produce a reliable Mac version, so I could dump Parallels, and I had high hopes for this particular product.  I could not have been more disappointed.  There is very little in this product that resembles the PC version.  If you're used to the PC version, you'll become very frustrated trying to work with the Mac version.  What is so difficult about giving us a product with the same features and interfaces as the PC version?  Between this and the Turbotax 2014 debacle, I beginning to wonder if there's anyone left at Intuit who knows what the hell is going on.  Come on, Intuit."
0,worthless poor support ending up using free rapid tax with no problems at all
1,"Every thing was great just like every year, I used the same computer etc. for my taxes and H&R block's software.      The mistake I made was, when I performed the check status of (my) return and received my DCN number, I decided rather than go into the other room to print it or my return's copies, I would PRINT SCREEN and cut/paste into a Word 2003 new document. Apparently that not only destroyed Word 2003 from working, it killed my laptop's video driver, and then killed Windows XP. I am now reinstalling the OS with no 2010 tax return back up file, no printed files, and no DCN number saved (because they are all being wiped out in the OS installation process).    Do NOT print screen for your DCN. Print the page and print your documents. Oh, and, it also killed Adobe PDF Writer (and Acrobat 8).  Well done to the software writers and .dll folks who failed Windows 101 programming.    Good luck!"
0,Downloaded the program then tried to start.  It told me that I need the updated XP software.  But MY OS is windows 7.  SO just go to the store buy the disk and save the hassle and loss of money.
0,unable to install the product; tried multiple times. Filled out form provided activation key with no results. Desire a refund.
1,"My friend liked it, I personally did not use it."
1,"5.0 Deluxe has been good to me so far, and I waited for the upgrade since Windows 8 came out.<br />VHS to DVD 7.0 doesn't have bells and whistles like other video editing software, but I don't care to use fancy software because it's time consuming to learn such software.<br />I've gotten used to the simple capture, edit, and burn/convert so I use the product with a new HD camcorder. I recommend the software upgrade to those who enjoyed the simple and easy of use with previous VHS to DVD products from Honestech."
1,Norton Internet Security 2012 - 3 user download was quick and product has met all my expectations. The price was extremely good.
1,I  love it! been using it for years! always protects my computer! way better than norton ever did! Just the best!
0,"I read the complaints about installing, but I thought it wouldn't happen to me, because I didn't have a problem with Excel 2013. But I couldn't install Word 2013, so I called Microsoft Support. A technician took control of my computer for 30 minutes, then disappeared into the cloud, without having fixed the problem. I reinstalled the program on my own, and it worked for a day, until it stopped working whenever I opened the program. Could it be some conflict with Word 2007? I'm not going to uninstall 2007, since that works fine. Why can't Microsoft write a program that works on its own operating system? A mystery."

Now I have to be honest with you by telling you that I could not down load this file after I payed for it but it got my curiosity going so I went and got the available one ( free ) Boy! am I glad I did.<br />it found 503 junk files and quarantined them.The speed increased a least 50%<br />Robert"
1,good. fast. works good
0,"I had to uninstall version 2014 and reinstall version 2011 because I need to track money loaned to others.  For some reason, Quicken decided to eliminate the loan tracking option.  The same thing happened with the 2013 version."
1,Very Nice video editor.
1,So easy to use.
1,"I am very pleased with the software I purchased.  When I purchased it, there was somehow an error and my account showed that I had purchased two instead of one.  Your customer service was helpful and deleted one of the purchases, but I felt as though they took the position that I made an error when ordering and I do not believe that was the case.  My credit card was credited for the second purchase so I really have no complaint...just annoying.  Very happy with the product."
1,"LOVE THIS!  The BEST antivirus I've ever had.  I've used MacAfee and Norton, but Avast has them beat hands-down.  I HIGHLY recommend this software.  You'll love it."
0,"I've used MS Money for several years and decided to try Quicken, esp since MS Money Plus isn't supported by MS any longer and, given my good experience with TurboTax, thought Quicken would be at least as good as Money. I have to say I was very disappointed. I would have given the nod to Quicken on features until I got tried to use 'categories' for transactions. I moved my old MS Money Plus file to Quicken and everything seem to transfer over all right but it too half a minute to \\""split\\"" a transaction into 3 sub-categories. For some reason, Quicken is moronically slow in finding the categories and subcategories for transactions I'm trying to enter. Entering, say 20  - 30 transactions into MS Money takes me several minutes. Quicken takes me at least twice that long. I haven't called the Quicken customer support to see what can be done but I suspect it's due to moving a set of categories over from an MS Money file rather than building them in Quicken. I'm really disheartened. I was looking forward to dumping MS Money and using Quicken from now on but this one flaw is just insurmountable.<br /><br />Update: I still hate this POS software. It's great except for the insurmountable flaw of the infinitely slow entry for splits. I keep reading about how Intuit's such a great company, great tech people, etc. Why can't they hire a programmer who can figure this out?"
1,Long-time user who really likes this product and relies on the accuracy of the results.
1,pc matic gives helpful advice.
1,Great product and delivery.  I've been using H&R Block for 21 years.  It is easy for do-it-your-selfers to handle their taxes.
0,"I own my own business, but do not use Quicken for that.  However, the icons and graphics taken most of the space where data was is quite frustrating.  For instance, when I download my mortgage payment into Quicken, I like to see how my principal and interest are progressing.  So when I look under Property and Debt on the left side of the screen, all I see are big graphics.  I can only see one or two months back and the rest of the screen are big graphics and percentages.  Why can't I use Quicken the way I did in 2010?  When I look at my \\""selected asset accounts\\"" I see more graphs.  Personally who cares about graphs.  I wish I had my 2010 back and my money back!"
1,"I received Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security as part of a Bzz campaign and have been using it for a month. I am please with it so far. It does what I need it to do and I think it does it well. Install was easy, I did have to uninstall my old software first, then everything else went smoothly. The controls are easy to use and I find the whole program easy to use and understand. When my 1 year is up, I will purchase again."
1,I've used this program for several years now and have consistently been satisfied with the performance.  I would recommend it to others.
1,"Product came as described, DOWNLOADING WAS EASY!"
0,I see ll of the ads saying you file for free why was I charged 35.00 to file my taxes?
1,i bought this so my son could do a project at my apartment  it worked but i think i should have bought a bundle instead
1,very good product
1,pretty good
1,I've been using TurboTax since 1992 (recently found the manual for the 1991 tax year). I will continue using it as long as they produce it!
0,This was my first time using Quicken. I was able to get the credit score to work and input all of my account information. however the program continually crashes.  Downloads all patches and mondo patch. nothing works. crashes just as soon as the program opens.  After reading the comments this program has so many bugs it is completely unusable.  Finally was sick of it after a week that I had to request a refund. It looks like a good program and was recommended by my accountant however going to have to look other places.
1,Great product for me in a small business setting.
1,Have used this product for 5+ years. Have had no problems with it. Reliable product. Have it running on 4 different computers.
1,Simple to use and follow.  As long as you have all your paperwork filing taxes is pretty straight forward with Turbo Tax.
1,Been using Quicken for over 15 years.  The 2014 edition continues its reputation.  Still the best financial product on the market.
1,"I always order Nortons from Amazon,it's easy,fast and never have any problems with the product.I had to do a restore on my computer so I ended up downloading it twice ,that went easily,I highly recomend buying Nortons from Amazon!"
1,The best anti-virus software period.
1,I had an older HP scanner which was not supported under Windows 7 Home Premium. By moving to Windows 7 Professional I was able to use the Windows 7 Virtual Machine feature and run Windows XP as a virtual machine under Windows 7. With this setup I was able to continue using my scanner.
0,"To all considering using Norton products, I strongly advise you not to. Myself, my family, and our business have all used Norton for the past 10 years but are done.<br /><br />I was double and triple-billed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 for Norton 360 on 1 computer. Why? Because every year I digitally replaced my Norton product with the most updated version when prompted by Norton through your software-- and yet they continued to bill me for the previous version! Again, I was replacing old versions digitally on only ONE computer and Norton had the gall to continue to bill me for old versions no longer even installed on my computer, since Norton replaced them when I updated!<br /><br />When I called Norton to explain this, I was first helped by a courteous young lady on Michael Babbit's staff in Springfield, OR who explained to me Norton's ridiculous and stubborn policy regarding refunds. She however was polite and respectful in speaking with me. When I spoke to Michael Babbit, her high and mighty supervisor, it was an entirely different story. The guy was condescending, rude, unhelpful and pompous. Like a little child he continued to repeat \\""You never toggled off auto-renew! This is policy!\\"" while offering no other insight or help. I am neither stupid nor unfamiliar with the concept of auto-renew. I make 95% of my purchases online, including all types of software. However I have never once paid a renewal charge on an outdated product that the company has prompted me to replace with a newer version by any company other than Norton. When I explained this fact and said that due to this I did not understand how Norton could possibly justify this, he sneered \\""How can I explain this to you in a way you'll understand?\\"" If their conversations are recorded, they can easily go back and listen to our conversation and won't have to take my word for what a jerk he was to me. He called me on Monday, 8/20 at 2 PM Pacific Time. I have honestly never been so insulted by any company's employee in my life. The fact that this guy is a supervisor is LAUGHABLE. Makes their company look absurd, as does the fact that they clearly endeavor to make some extra money by conning consumers into unknowingly paying auto-renewal fees on old versions of your product.<br /><br />In short: I am done with their company, as is my family of 8 and my family business. That's close to $1,000 a year that they have chosen to forego for overcharging me a few hundred dollars. Great business strategy! That coupled with their mediocre product should surely keep them as the #1 Antivirus product for a LONG time.<br /><br />I recommend you switch to Kaspersky Lab, which is a far superior product with excellent customer service and business practices. I am in no way affiliated with them but have been very pleased since I replaced Norton with them. If you do a simple Google search, you can find a rebate that will get you their Pure antivirus software free for the first year. As opposed to Norton which gives nothing free and overcharged me for the past 3 years. Done and DONE with them."
1,I am running W8 32-bit and everything is good and enough for my recording.. And that is what about it !
1,"I wanted to do my own taxes and have been using TurboTax for years. This was the first time I bought it online, and it was easy and cheaper than going to their site and doing it online."
1,Husband loves this software.
1,No damaging occurrences have made it through to our computer.  Avast doesn't seem to slow the computer at all and all dangers have been blocked.
1,Makes corporate business so much easier! Well worth the investment for no more the cost and its easy to download..
0,"This software worked, but it caused problems with my laptop that disappeared when I removed the software.  Price was nice, but not worth it."
1,Buying TurboTax thru Amazon Prime is the only way to go. You get the best price with no hassles and you can download it right away and get started with your taxes. It even came with Federal Efile and state tax Efile for a small fee.
1,Hard to switch when it makes filing a return easy and I have an accounting degree and focused on Taxation.
1,Love the idea of giving me a warning for possible audit issue and max my deductions. It also explains all the tax terms that am not familiar with.
1,It was easier to put on my computer  than last year and I don't have to worry about my daughters computer either .  Thank you
1,The software is excellent and I've been using it for years. The problem I had was that I couldn't get it loaded. I had to contact the Norton Symetec people via a chat and they loaded it; this took about 25 minutes. I never had this problem when I purchased the disc and loaded it myself.
1,"Software is great and easy to use. Even after calling Amazon a few times, I could never figure out how to use my 25 dollar credit."
1,"Well, they got us - if you have more than 1 device, no choice but to subscribe - Bill Gates now has his straw firmly into our wallets.  That said, subscription price is good for 5 devices, no more licensing issues - downloads and validation are fine - and lots of good collaboration factors.  At least the monopoly is offering a good product with good value at this time - we'll see how that plays out over time."
0,"In order to use the software, you need to figure out how to use it. I cannot figure out how to use. It does me no good at all."
1,Office for Mac itself works great...it's just taking some time for me to get used to switching from a PC to a Mac. So far I love it.
1,"There is no better antivirus, smooth and safe, highly recomended"
0,"They have completely ruined budgeting in Quicken 2013! I've used Quicken for years and been on an older version until they turned off the bank syncing and forced me onto this new version. Despite considering that a slimy tactic, I decided to buy the new version anyway. Boy am I disappointed, I can't figure out the new budget creator to save my life. All of my friends have moved to Mint.com and I've held out because I liked Quicken so much (I've been a Quicken user since the DOS version in 1990). Congratulations, You've just managed to create another Mint.com customer! The only way they'll be able to retain me is to release a patch that reverts to the budget style used in previous versions. I hope they enjoy their company's last few years turning a profit, that's about to end."
0,"Forget the mobile app. It is useless as many accounts you can't login but with the same password and user ID you can on the desktop version. Nothing has , old problems with the mobile app in previous versions."
1,Good for being free. System hog though
0,"It sucks! Duplicated some of my accounts, it wants me to pay for the mobile update, and I'm generally unhappy with it. I've had nothing but problems. I've used Quicken for years and wish I had never updated!"
0,this is not user friendly<br />the old print shop was much more user friendly<br />I cannot figure out how to transfer images from my scanner to the print shop<br />I need instructions I don't know where to go to get instructions
0,"Not as user friendly as I was expecting- not as many options when working with audio tracks as I was expecting- and this might be user error, but I had trouble sincing attached audio tracks to the video's audio track. This was easy to do with Windows Live, but my first few attempts with the Corel product have had poor results."
0,Unable to open it in windows 8 or above.
0,Please don't make the mistake I did - I have a Mac OS and in my haste I downloaded the PC version.  Amazon will not refund / exchange in such a case - despite the fact the the download did not even function and no full file was ever transferred.  I had to go the route of requesting a refund directly from Intuit.  My one star rating is therefore intended as a ding against the Amazon / Intuit policy not the product itself.  So much for the convenience of one click purchasing!
1,"I was a little nervous purchasing this product with some of the other reviews out there.  I had no problems whatsoever downloading, installing or using this product.  It got the job done quite nicely."
1,"I've never used any other program for my taxes, but i like the fact that for around the price for efile stand alone, i get the program and 5 federal efiles.  state efile costs extra, but I just print off and mail the forms.  The walk through was easy to follow.  I have no complaints"
1,This works great.  Just what I needed
1,yep
0,"Really disappointed, still cant figure out how to utilize, slows down my pc. Bought to organize my photos and read that it was pretty user friendly. I must be an idiot. I cant figure this app out to save my life. I work on computers all day long at work and although I'm no expert I'm no newbie nether.<br />I'm deleting it from my pc today, money down the drain. At least it wasn't to expensive."
0,"I am so glad that I saw the comments on losing the capability for capital gains.  I am going to find out what other products still have this capability and if they work with my stock site.  Thank you everyone for point this out.  I suppose that there will be others who will still pay the extra money, but I hope that they don't so we can keep both the functionality and the lower price in future years."
1,"Just downloaded this and it's nowhere as bad as everyone is saying here. I think it makes better photo creations, though it kinda lags moving pictures around making business cards, etc.<br />I tired to make just one business card image because that's all I wanted and it came out great, except it came out as a sheet of 10 and I only wanted one, so for the moment I had to use the postcard setting for what I wanted. Unfortunately it came out kinda blurred but I guess I'll have to live with it.<br />Should of stuck with the original user friendly format of 2.2.and then added these new features to it.<br />Overall if you have Windows 8 or 8.1 and need a cheap way to make business cards, forms, banners, definitely buy this. Version 2.2 works on Windows 8, no problem but I upgraded my OS to windows 8.1 and had no choice."
1,This is what I bought  that I will use till I am forced to buy another  computer  This one might be my last one but next time I buy I know what I want and  will buy it complete than to buy programs  by someone else that knows what they are doing.I know what I  like now.  Since I am 87 I am not giving up on the computers.  So sad so many my age don't know about a computer.
1,Great
0,"I own Quicken Premier 2011. I guess I'll have to upgrade to 2014 when it comes out or my Bank won't work with it. So when will QP2014 be available? Any indication that Quicken has seriously fixed all the bugs in 2013? Will Quicken pay me to beta test it if I buy the first release when it becomes available? Is \\""Katherin\\"" still project manager or did they hire a professional? Any updates?"
0,"I upgraded from QuickBooks 2011 and, honestly, there isn't much difference here.  The format it entirely the same with a few cosmetic differences.<br /><br />I've also had some issues with the program crashing.  This tends to happen the most (about once per month) when processing credit card transactions.  They payment will go through, but it won't record the transaction when this happens, which means you have to make a new transaction to match.  A bit annoying.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a good product; it suits our small business' needs nicely.  But, having upgraded, I see why some people wait to years and years before getting the latest version."
1,"I got what I wanted from this. It protects what it can, and I'm alright with that."
1,"Originally, I used the free avast! anitvirus software because prior to that what was on the computer did not prevent a malicious malware from attacking my computer.  After much headache and work work work to rid my computer of the malware, avast! was suggested to me and from that point on, I never had another problem.  When I started back to school for my degree, I upgraded from the free avast! to paying for the next level of protection because I knew what I had stored on my computer was more than I could afford to lose.  After 3 years, I am very happy to report no problems still.  Yes, avast! has prevented a couple from happening because it always alerts me to suspicious webpages and downloads (there have been a few).  Thank you avast! for the great protection and I love that voice from no where that let's me know daily that my avast! has been upgraded!"
1,"I have used Quickbooks for over ten years now, and find that it does almost everything that I need it to do accounting wise.  I would highly recommend this program to anyone who needs accounting software."
1,Worked like a charm ...easy breezy ..over half the price of renewing from previous install...just do it!
1,yeah is cool and fun to use!
1,"As a user of Turbo Tax software for over a decade, I'm obviously sold on it. I have bought the more expensive versions but for a typical family with checking, savings, investment property, portfolio, well, the deluxe version handles it effortlessly and allows free efile for 4 family members, a great deal imo."
1,Did a great job cleaning the old garbage out of the systems. Just be aware that any URL passwords will be removed as well. Read the options before pressing the clean-up.
0,This Product is a terrible waste of time and money
1,Turbo tax was so easy to use.  The instructions were extremely detailed.
0,I had to send it back.  Hung a lot and had to close often.<br />Not intuitive. I will not purchase again.
1,"I have personally used WebPlus since X4. I am now on X8. I do not even pretend to understand the negative comments here. I have used this product for professional information sites, educational sites, product sales sites, and most recently, numerous political candidate sites. Once you understand its simple cognitive map, it is excellent.  (Yes, I have used Dreamweaver and WebPlus 8 is better for most people.)  And, yes, your sites will come together quickly and easily. The layout is WYSIWYG. It now has the ability to do Mobile-compliant sites through the templates in the Serif Resource Guide.  The links to PayPal, Youtube, Facebook, Pinterest, etc. are quick and easy. It has a straight forward shopping cart feature.  And, developing response forms is far easier than in any other package that I have used.  Serif will even host your WebPlus-designed site for you.  As a disclaimer, I do not work for or have any relationship with Serif software.  I am a professional marketing consultant and have been so for 35 years. Many of my clients use WebPlus others use Dreamweaver, Wordpress, etc."
1,Works extremely smooth on my new MacBook Air 2013. Absolutely no differences that I can notice from Windows version. Happy with purchase.
1,Everything worked out OK
0,"After using this application for several months, I started getting error messages that Windows Defender wasn't working and Windows System 7 couldn't update. The computer had become terribly slow, taking way too long to boot, and after booting it took several minutes to launch Outlook and other MS Office applications. When I had an evidently unrelated problem with my wireless network, I couldn't figure out how to disable the firewall so I could check my wireless router set-up menu. I emailed iObit and asked them several questions: \\""How do I turn off the firewall?\\"", \\""If I uninstall the program, how do I reinstall it?\\"", \\""Could it be interfering with Windows Defender?\\"", etc. The response didn't answer any of my questions; it appeared to be a canned answer without regard to my problems. In three or four exchanges of emails and they steadfastly refused to answer the questions (such as, \\""How do I turn the firewall off temporarily?\\""). I asked for my money back because I wasn't getting the tech support I paid for, and ultimately they agreed to do it (although I haven't checked to see if I was properly credited on my Visa card yet).<br /><br />Long story short, I uninstalled the program, and installed the paid version of AVG Internet Security 2014 in its place. My computer now boots much, much more quickly, MS Office loads without problems, there are no error messages about Windows Defender or Windows upgrades, and I'm able to turn off the firewall if needed."
0,"My attempted download resulted in my computer pulling in some malware/virus that drove me to restore the computer to a date prior to the attempted download. As a result I never got Word. I did however pay Amazon and I spent hours and dollars restoring my computer. Never, NEVER, again will I attempt to download any program. There are too many creeps out there with malice aforethought to allow free enterprise to work here."
1,As always the program just gets easier. The price just keeps going up. I am required to file a Ca. state even though I don't owe anything. I feel that the Turbo Tax Fee to e-file  the Ca return is excessive.
0,did not work would not update
1,I've been using Avast for years and they just keep making it better.
1,"Our company has used Quickbooks since its inception with great results. This year, with its new, online format, Quickbooks has an even greater ease of use and reliability of back-up information. Thus far, we've been incredibly pleased with our decision to use Essentials."
0,What you get are a few public domain images that anyone could find for free through an image search. Please don't waste your money on this.
1,This product came quickly and was just what I needed. Thank you.You even save the activation codes online so I can retrieve them whenever I need them. That is cool.
0,"I would not recommend this tax software to anyone.  I had a very hard time downloading my taxable information from my TD Ameritrade account.  That process was extremely frustrating and irritating.  I was told by TD Ameritrade that had I used a purchased H&R Block disk instead of the downloaded version I used I would not have had the download issues.  That was in no way satisfying to me.  The thing that turned me off the most about H&R Block was the fact that although I had purchased a federal version, which included one state return, H&R Block charged me another $20 for me to file a state return.  Even though next year I will have to enter much information manually if I use another tax company to file my 2014 taxes, I will gladly do it to get rid of H&R Block once and for all.  Don't go with them, you'll probably regret it if you do."
1,"Ugraded to this from Quicken 2002 (2002 does not work on Windows 8).  Interface is changed somewhat, but it still does not deal with processing restricted stock units smoothly.  Still, it does most of what I need it to do, and I will probably try out some of the other features, including a hopefully improved budget creator."
0,The price increase and de-contenting efforts of Intuit has caused me to think about using other software next year.  I've used TurboTax for many years.  What a shame!
1,"A very nice update to Quicken Essentials. That said, if you didn't like Quicken Essentials, you won't like Quicken for Mac 2015 at the moment.  Still, the developers have committed to adding functionality, for free, throughout the first year.  As a beta-tester, I watched the product go from a very early state to a nicely polished program built on the Quicken Essentials base with an easier to use register, significant investment capabilities, and on-demand syncing with Quicken's mobile app."
0,"I appreciate the lowered price, and I only needed it on one device anyway, but I really wish they had included Outlook, or at least offered it at a discounted price after purchasing this bundle,"
1,"Great free AV,been using it for years on several computors & never had any problems or virus's pop up on them."
1,This was one of the best purchases I have ever made.  It helps me keep my finances in order.  It is easy to use.
1,Works great!
1,"I have been using WordPerfect since the beginning of time.  I have bowed to the inevitable and have started migrating files to Microsoft Word, but prefer WordPerfect for certain things.  I especially like the View Codes capability.<br /><br />And my wife LOVES WordPerfect.  She really wants nothing to do with Microsoft Word.<br /><br />But when I installed WordPerfect X6 on my wife's computer, her Microsoft Outlook email program would no longer work.  I did a System Restore to move back to an earlier time--effectively uninstalling WordPerfect--and Outlook resumed working.<br /><br />So, unless I could find a way to resolve the conflict, my wife would have to choose between Microsoft Outlook (which she uses for email) and WordPerfect (which she dearly loves for word processing.<br /><br />Her mandate to me was GET IT FIXED.  I WANT WORDPERFECT AND I WANT EMAIL--AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  She didn't exactly use those words, but that was the message.<br /><br />As they say, when Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!!!<br /><br />The conflict turned out to be a corrupted Microsoft file, but it took me 3-4 days to learn that--and to learn how to fix it.<br /><br />The first thing I learned is that it is VERY difficult to find a way to get free tech support from Corel for a newly purchased product.  However, their PAID tech support is very INEXPENSIVE ($19).  When I finally broke down and paid $19, I found WordPerfect's tech support to be quite good.<br /><br />LESSON LEARNED:  As long as Corel has paid tech support for $19, that's the way to go.  Don't drive yourself crazy trying to get free tech spt from Corel.<br /><br />Then I had to go to Microsoft to get the bad Microsoft file fixed so we could use WordPerfect and Microsoft Outlook on the same computer.<br /><br />Microsoft wanted $99 for their tech spt, which would be good for 30 days for this one issue only.<br /><br />Instead of doing that, I paid $199 for Microsoft Home and Office 2010, which would give me 90 days of tech support on all the office applications.  I had some questions about Word and Excel, so the higher price was worth it to me.<br /><br />All in all, this was an expensive fix to this problem--expensive both in time and money--but we finally got there--and I am out of the doghouse.  Well worth the money!!!<br /><br />Dick Donovanve me 90 days of tech support on all the office applications.

1,"I only put good because there are a few quibbles. Word and Excel are painfully slow booting up and there are some things in Outlook that are counterintuitive to operate. Such as, how do you make a group contacts list from an excel spreadsheet? It should be a lot simpler than it is."
1,"still learning to use it, but easy to follow for keeping the business organized this is great, thank you for producing this program."
0,"This year's program was terrible.  You were unable to pull updates.  This is a known bug, because they have a manual work-a-round documented.  You cannot get updated state forms, since there is no workaround for that bug.  You can't file the return without getting the latest updates, but you can't get the updates.  I spent more time on the phone with customer service (multiple times and multiple tickets opened) than I spent completing my taxes.  And there customer service was terrible.  They would not resolve my problem (after hours on the phone), they would tell me they were going to have the next level support contact me, then the next day I would get an email that the ticket was closed.  This happened TWICE.  I have used Turbo tax for years, but never again.  If I could give 0 stars, I would."
1,This is a great software to track all bank and credit card accounts. This eliminates the need to use several spreadsheets to track bills. Works great.
1,I have used this product for 7 years in a row now and they make it easier and easier every year.  Keep up the good work intuit!
0,"Been a customer for 13 years.  Never again.  Intuit has completely lost track of any idea what they are doing.  They have misdirected my refund through some third party bank I have never heard of, and have no idea how to get it back.  I have now spent 6+ hours on the phone with several companies trying to get a hold of the refund that Intuit lost.  They are completely clueless and you should NEVER trust them with your business.  I have seriously never dealt with such an inept company in my life.  Apparently multiple levels of their management have no clue how the product actually works.  I stopped using Quicken last year because of the same ineptness.  Don't buy anything from this company, and if you own stock in Intuit SELL, SELL, SELL.  BTW, first time ever I have spent the time writing a negative review.  They are that bad."
1,"A top notch program that does it all - a hard drive file manager with scan-ocr-pdf handling features that can also archive, organize, and find computer files. Plus many other helpful features too numerous to mention. I've been using a 'power' hard drive manager program for years that turned buggy re: Win 8 some time ago, so can't say how happy I am to have found this program."
1,"I've used TurboTax for many years and been satisfied. I had a more complicated tax situation this year, and this edition of the software handled it with ease. It seems more user-friendly than ever. In addition, I had to replace my computer in mid-stream and was able to redownload the software from Amazon, transfer the working file from backup, and go on as if nothing had happened. Very pleased with both Amazon download services and TurboTax."
1,With Media Player missing a must have.
0,It came free with my used laptop and i wasn't too sure about it last wk when it notified me it stopped a few attacks to my system. That definitely made me feel protected.
1,"I like this a lot, easy to create a lot of different graphics. Not complicated to use."
0,Tech Support is a joke.  You write them an email stating the 3.05 patch will not apply and rather than issue a 3.05 patch that actually works they ask for your address so they can ship you Print Shop 23.1.  You write and tell them you want Print Shop Pro 3.05 and they offer NO clue.  Apparently tech support is offshore and performed by people who can not read English.
0,"Lies, lies and more lies... you spring an additional $37 fee to file my state taxes at the end."
1,Great program have used for years and handles everything you need. It handles all my business needs along with the household.
1,Very pleased at how quick I received the download
0,"I used Quicken several years ago and finally gave up on it because every time I downloaded transactions from my bank and investment accounts, I would need to clean up duplicates or transfers or something. It was more work than it was worth.<br /><br />I picked up Quicken 2013 because I had a new need: to track the value, asset allocation, and performance of all my investments (including my wife's). I don't care about individual transactions; I just want the big picture. And yet I find that Quicken still makes me examine and resolve transactions that it doesn't fully understand. It's too much of a pain in the neck.<br /><br />I've experimented with free online investment trackers (personalcapital and sigfig). They're not perfect either, but I'm leaning towards using one of them over Quicken."
1,It's been working great for me.
1,"Works great, but can be an annoyance with the pop-ups."
1,Having Quickbooks has cut down in time and efforts on paper work and has made the office much more efficient and effective.
0,"I just submitted my return with this program and found out the hard way that it does not include State filing; you have to buy it separately. I am a former Turbo Tax user and bought this because of the way-lower price. I'm looking at the thumbnail for this product and you can hardly make it out on my 15&#34; Mac screen that it only says Federal. Maybe I just assumed that these kinds of programs have both because of my experience with Turbo Tax, and the price was lower because it was a download thing and not a physical disk with packaging.<br />As for the program itself, it can import your file from Turbo Tax if you used that last year. The interface isn't as dummy-proof as TT so it may be hard to navigate or even understand at times. I was second-guessing myself on a few questions and I did not feel comfortable trying to work backwards. I ultimately e-filed my Federal taxes and it took me until just before writing this that I would have to buy State for about $40. I'm either going back to TT next year or going to an actual H&R Block agent, so I wouldn't say it's a complete loss on their part."
1,"When purchasing, you will get a license key, just write it down, go to the website, everything comes to your pc for you.  Enter the key and you are off.  Great graphics, does not slow down your pc and is working well for me."
1,"It works, I have used turbotax for more than 10 years and don't know of any tax software easier to use."
0,Downloaded but didn't open
1,"I bought this program and downloaded it in October 2010 for a big Halloween party. It was a HUGE hit with the kids and I have used it countless times since then! It allows you to make indoor and outdoor scavenger hunts for adults and/or children. It allows you to make multiple groups and designate how many steps you want. My favorite features are being able to customize the hints and also the way they print with a tip at the bottom of each hint on where to put that specific clue. It really makes this fast and mindless for me!  TIP: Print the different groups' puzzles on different colored paper so you can have teams that only find their colored clues. Otherwise the kids find each others clues and it can mess up the hunt.    This program is well worth the $20. Plus, I just bought a new laptop and emailed their support to see how to get the program on my new computer and they responded within 24 hours with directions on how to do this for no additional fees!"
1,"I have been using Lightroom on and off since version 2.  Not being a professional photographer, nor graphic artist, Lightroom has provided easy to use functions for me.  The feature set can be used by Novice and Professional alike.<br /><br />Every time I use Lightroom, I discover a new feature to make my images better."

0,"I got this in November and started working on a 1041 trust return, just putting in estimates trying to get an idea of my tax situation.  After getting updated forms, my tax return became unreadable, causing the program to crash just trying to open the file.  So I started over, wasting about an hour re-entering the data.  Today I got updated forms again, and once again, my tax return can't be opened.  I will have to start over once more.  I'm really disappointed.  The only good thing I can say is it was cheaper than TurboTax, but then you get what you pay for."
1,"Works great.  Just like the online version, but for only $16.00, and it comes with 5 free electronic filings also..."
0,TurboTax was unable to print Maryland Form 502 CR due to a glitch in the software program.  This form is needed to obtain credit for taxes paid in other states.  Many TurboTax users complained of this problem but the software problem was still not fixed when taxes were due.

0,"I HAVE BEEN MATCHING QUICKEN AND TURBO TAX FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS. I LIKE THE NEW FEATURE OF THE CREDIT REPORT.

1,"As a former PC User and Microsoft Office 2003,2007 and 2010 Versions I found this product to be exactly as anticipated and pleased to be using a product on my Mac that works as well what I have been using in the past on my PC. The functions I am use to work every bit as good on the Mac platform as Windows 7."
1,I've been using Norton for five years now. It is a great product! Never an issue with my computer. Highly recommended!
1,This software is the best! It will ask you questions just like a tax preparer and take care of all the forms you need!
1,"It is great! So happy to have Microsoft Office for more than a year. However, MAC owners take note, you might as well just buy the Office 2011 for the single price of 120 or whatever it is because the download gives you the 2011 version for MAC anyways and it's not a subscription. I also bought the keycard and not the amazon download. So get that as well if you want this program. Great for college students."
1,Been using Turbo Tax for years and has always been easy and useful.  Saved tons of dough over using a CPA and bet I'm getting similar results!
1,"This software  saved me three hundred dollars, I am a author and I am using this to write my story's<br />ain't life grand when  there  is  still free stuff on amazon,  why buy when you can get something like this that works just as good as one  that you would buy<br />thanks to the makers and suppliers , If you looking for a good free software this product should be your first  choice.  less face it these day there is few free software out on the internet that's  free. by the way if your looking for a e book to read free try one of my stories that's  free on amazon, called Moonshine Whiskey wedding , it free like  this  software , thank for reading"
0,"I will update the review for software content after I have had a chance to use it - this is about the process of buying it today as part of the Gold Box deal.<br /><br />I chose the PC download version so I wouldn't have to wait, plus my Surface3 doesn't have a CD drive.<br />The download process from Amazon was easy, it installed, launched and suggested an update. no problem - but then it wanted to \\""add a Language Level\\"" from a CD. I didn't find any easy answer, however the Rosetta support site has a page for downloading from them (I googled \\""rosetta stone install without cd\\"" and there is a version 4/TOTALe link to follow)<br /><br />That process was time consuming, installing the Akamai installer, etc but when i was done my product key from Amazon worked and I have created my account, started the 90 days of online access and the Windows software opens.<br /><br />Good Luck to you all!"

0,"I thought I was getting an exceptional player since I didn't have windows media player but once I downloaded the software and ran it, it shut down my system and gave me the blue screen of death!  I thought it was a fluke but I retried opening the player after recovering from the blue screen and again the blue screen reappeared.  I tried many times over but it still gave me the same screen.  I suspect that the software has a virus.  I got tired of trying and gave up.  Do not buy this!"

0,"I bought Office 365, which is basically Office 2013 on a subscription basis.  It installed fine and the whole cloud thing seemed kind of cool.  Then visited Panama City Beach where I needed my word processor and it had completely disappeared from my computer.  I reinstalled it when I got home, then went to Venice, Florida and it kept telling me it needed to configure (which it had already done at home).  Got home and it worked just fine, then went to a writer's conference in Tallahassee, where I live, and it went into getting office ready for me permanently.  I needed this program for my laptop, and it only works at my home, where I don't use my laptop.  What a bunch of crap.  I guess I am out my $99 but will not renew this subscription, and do not recommend it to anyone who actually wants to do any work on their computer.  I will be forced to buy another copy of Word 2010 to actually do any work on my computer.  Good job Microsoft, another screw up that hurts your users."
1,"Since using this product ,I have not had any problems.I am currently useing a asus G73.I also use it on my desktop."
1,Been using TTax probably since it came out. Can't believe there is a better way to do taxes.
1,"Good product, easy to use, beautiful UI.  Thanks"
0,"Just as other reviewers have said, the program is riddled with errors. I love Mavis Beacon and she taught me how to type a long time ago, but this software needs to be fixed. I got a refund from Amazon and told them to research the problem: let's see if they do."
1,"Free, good UI, easy-to-use. What else can you ask for.  :)"
1,Good software easy to use and can transfer tax files from previous year. The only downside is they didn't include rental properties and investment in this version like they did in previous years.
0,"Please do not buy this product as the full video tutorials are only viewable in a 6\\"" window on my mac. IT doesn't offer full screen mode and there is no tech support. Waste of money"
1,"I've used Turbo Tax in the past but due the recent complaints, I decided to try H&R Block Tax software. This was extremely easy to use and since we file an EZ form, we did not have to go through all the deduction questions which saved a lot of time. The step-by-step process was very easy to understand. I was finished with the return in about 30 minutes. I will definitely choose the H&R Block software next year."
0,"When the multi-clip function disappeared, I tried to re-download the software. The trail was circular... I was directed back to the same place I started from. When directed to my account, there was no tab unless I started over only to experience the same problem. Corel X7 just came out, so I tried to download the free version. After 60 minutes downloading the behemoth two different times, an error window instructed to re-load. A waste of time and money."
1,"this purchase was received promptly, exactly as promised.  This was for two desktop replacements at my office.  The item was necessary for production requirements of some of the office software.  The price was competitive and the items downloaded properly.<br />thanks"
1,"So far, this software has been very awesome. 3D works & everything I've thrown at it so far has run smoothly. Not too flashy, not very many ads/BS ruining the experience, just a good product.<br />A whole lot better than my experiences with PowerDVD which plays very few of my 3D BDs, despite claiming to be able to play all of them."
0,"The other reviewer is correct -- this download didn't work, eventually they just refunded my money and I had to order the hard copy anyway.  What a pain."
0,"Needed to move my files from my PC to my Mac after it started to die.  iBank is sufficient for keeping track of all of my bank accounts, investments and loans/credit cards etc.  I do miss some of my Quicken features, but for the most part I am happy with the software."
0,too complicated and it does not convert or compress video images to dvd format
0,"I downloaded Norton 360 and typed in the key, and it said it was not valid! Do not purchase. Rip off."
1,What a bunch of whiners.  People keep repeating the same complaint without any details.  It makes no sense at all and they are all crying over $20 or $30 and it is not like H & R Block is any bargain.  They have hidden costs for E-filing as well.  I've used TT for years and it has been a life saver for me.  When I'm ready to do my taxes I'll look for the best value for me and pick one.  Even AII joined the whines.  You can buy a subscription to hear them whine too.
1,"I think that I received a very good price for the lifetime maps- I saved about 17 dollars as opposed to the price that was being offered on the Garmin website.  The installation was very easy.  Just make sure- on my web browser the product key to enter on the Garmin website came up as a popup and was promptly blocked!  Luckily, I had read other reviews that said that this information can be obtained from my account which I did without difficulty."
1,Great protection
0,"I installed on my Windows 7 ultimate and everything went fine until I ran a full system scan .......after two days this antivirus kept being stuck at 80% of the scan and the worst was it was using 99% of the pc's ram memory, I had to cancel the task. I went and bought Avira Pro and this one is working perfectly without any issues."
1,"I recently purchased a MacBook Air. The reviews for Quicken for Macs were bad. I highly recommend iBank4. For my purposes, it has the functionality that I need."
1,"This is a nice app for drawing up and testing rhythms.  I am not much of a music person, I have taken a couple classes out of curiosity and now my kids love putting together little ditties.<br />This is not the easiest one I have used, but it is nicely displayed, plays well, and is not too difficult to navigate."
1,"Thank you! Thank you! for this wonderful,blessed, and so helpful program. I know my boyfriend loves me because by sharing this he's contributing financial independence to my life plus the knowledge in how technology is a blessing and agreat contribution to our lives and for our future family's lives, such as this. If this has been working for my honey Kam then I for sure know it'll help me. This is coming from a woman who wants to have control and be independently involved in my financial affairs of my life. Quicken fits perfectly into my catergory of life for personal use. I also heard and love quickbooks but that program does not work for me in what I need in my life.<br />Thank you!!!"
1,"Yeah, this is great. I feel real protected from hackers..."
0,"Toast worked as advertised for the most part. Corel (apparently Roxio's parent) gives a measly 14 day warranty, with one question that you can ask for free, about ROXIO TOAST. After that it seems you are thrown to the wolves as it were. There is a forum that seems to have an active community and that's good. If you have the time try to use EVERY option before their &#34;warranty&#34; runs out.<br /><br />I have the Apple OSX version of the software. I found that the ARCHIVE function kept crashing the APP every time I plugged in my Camera (CANON HFM32) until one day it stopped doing that. Could not find a reason for no more crashes but then once it stopped crashing it also did not back up my camera files as advertised. Still trying to figure that out.<br /><br />On the positive side, once you share your iMovie for a media browser Toast does produce a good quality disk image if you need one of those old fashion DVDs. It does copy and data disks. Have not tried convert yet.<br /><br />I gave it a three star rating because of the measly warranty and the archive issue. I hope these get fixed without having to purchase an upgrade which seems to be their MO, as I found out."
0,"Turbo Tax has pulled a fast one.  Last year they charged 30 bucks for their Basic, which did everything most taxpayers need.  This year they cut the price of their Basic to 15 bucks, but they made this version useless for most taxpayers, who will now require TT's 50- or 70-buck upgrade.  There's an easy way to avoid this rip-off.  I just bought H&R Block's Basic version for 20 bucks, and it appears to do everything TT Basic did in prior years.  All the forms are included.  Also, it imports your 2013 data from your old TT file."
1,I have tried several antivirus programs both one's that I have paid for and the free one's and I find Avast to be the best of all of them. It takes a much smaller chunk of CPU resources and provides me with all the protection I need.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Avast!!!
0,There are parts of the program used to send reports to the accountant that do not work and I understand Intuit wants to charge as much as the cost of the program to fix.  Will work around but will not recommend Quckbooks to anyone
1,downloaded less than 5 minutes and up and running.  Best product yet.  would recommend to friends and amazon shoppers.  love it.
1,well done
1,love it
1,I have been using AVAST since I knew that computer may crash or hacked or go into trouble withouust some antivirus. thus I used freed AVAST till some years back. And then I expend a few constructive bucks for ProAVAST. I am tension-free  in all these 10 years of using it..
0,"I used to have Quicken 2012 Deluxe, but Quicken notified me that in order to continue downloads from my financial institutions, I would need to upgrade.  Given Quicken 2012 Deluxe worked just fine for me, I was reluctant to upgrade, but did because April 2015 deadline was looming.<br /><br />Well, the 2015 version of Quicken has been nothing but trouble.  I have a few accounts I have to reset or deactivate/reactivate almost every time I update my transactions.  They just stop downloading even though Quicken message says all downloaded as of &#34;&#60;insert present day here&#62;&#34;.  Then when I reset the account or deactivate/reactivate, all transactions that I already downloaded from the prior few months are duplicated so I have to go in and then manually delete the duplicated ones.  Needless to say this is extremely error-prone and 2-3 times now I have had to compare my banks website to Quicken to make a reconciliation (for example if I deleted the wrong transaction and now account is unbalanced).<br /><br />I talked to Quicken support through their Chat interface and eventually the tech support person had me turn off automatic downloads to the register and we were hoping that fixed it.  Unfortunately no and today I came in and my accounts wouldn't update until I deactivated/reactivated.  I'm busy deleting transactions duplicated now. :(  I was hoping that this problem would be quickly rectified by Quicken, but it's hanging on now since I bought the SW in ~ Jan/Feb timeframe.  Honestly I am spending a lot of time to analyzing problems with Quicken and not much time looking at my finances.  I wish there was some alternative to Quicken.  All I really want to do is download my transactions to track my spending and map to budgets.  I want it to be relatively easy process (not 20 minutes overhead each time I use the program)."
1,My machine and my daughter's were infected and killed by a virus in a Zone Alarm Download back in December 2013. That was the only issue in about 7 years.  Much better than where I work and they have expensive antivirus and professional i t guys and viruses 2 or 3 times each year.
1,This was much easier to use than HR Block Home. I received roughly the same return as last year but it was a faster process with this version.
0,At the time of advertising the app was not clearly labeled Mac or PC. I found out after the purchase process that the app did not work on my computer type.
0,I own Magix Video pro I wish they would make this product using the same track setup to many extra unnecessary steps for multi-track recording

0,"This is the same poor experience that Intuit has delivered over the past five or so years.  A few low-lights from my month or so of use:<br /><br />- My accounts randomly lose transactions, resulting in hours of headache from having to go back to find and add the missing transactions.  This bug existed in Quicken 2013, and still has not been fixed.  I contacted Intuit support, and they did not offer any assistance other than having me install a patch that was already installed.<br />- My bank accounts fail to sync after an additional account at the same bank is added to Quicken.<br />- Quicken freezes indefinitely when I hit the &#34;resolve&#34; button to try to fix the above sync issue.<br />- When I start Quicken up again after closing it due to the above freeze, the bank accounts still won't sync, and now appear with useful names such as [CREDIT CARD].<br />- Quicken crashes about 1/3 of the time that I click on the File menu.  I'm not even joking.<br /><br />I don't have the patience to keep digging into Pandora's Box to see what other bugs might await me.  This has been the worst experience I've ever had with a piece of commercial software, and I've asked Intuit for a refund.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just got the refund check in the mail, just under one month from e-mailing the refund request.  I didn't even get an auto-response when I e-mailed the refund request, and through 2-3 customer service chats couldn't get any update on the status of the refund or whether they had even received it.  If you are thinking you might try this with the assurance of Intuit's money back guarantee, be aware that your refund request will go into a bit of a black hole."
0,"my rating is for the trial version only, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to make beats on this trial.  I'm still considering getting the pro version though, or maybe the full acid 10 home version.  It's just that the trial version didn't give me access to what I wanted or I didn't know how to access it.  Tutorials are limited.  Online tutorials are non-existent on making beats from the music 10 version.  maybe I'll download the trial again and if I figure it out on second round then I'll amend my rating."
0,couldn't get the program to work on my iMac.
0,I am very disappointed because I was not able to download the  office software and amazon would not give me a refund and told me to call Microsoft to get it resolved.
1,Received as described. Good Seller.

0,"I upgraded from 2012 to 2014.  In the process of trying to add the Dillards and Bananna credit card accounts, I received an error and the program instructed me to try again later.  I waited a day, tried again, and received the same error.  My first attempt to reach support was on 11/4 and I gave up after being on hold for over 30 minutes.  On 11/5, an agent answered after 50 minutes.  He was rude, frequently spoke over me, and then requested log files but would not stay on the line and assist me in sending the log files.  I sent the log files.  No response on 11/5, so I sent another message asking for next steps.  No response on 11/6, so I called into support.  After 55 minutes on hold, a representative looked at my account and said more logs were needed.  She helped me send the appropriate files and told me that it would take a few days for them to review.  Today 11/12, I received a message stating that internet banking is down for scheduled maintenance and to try again later.  Scheduled maintenance for over a week?  I did try again--it's still not working.<br /><br />I just received another response on 11/17 asking me to \\""refresh my accounts\\"" and see if the problem is resolved.  I don't have a problem with refreshing--I can't add the accounts in the first place.  I sent more logs and today, 11/18, received the same e-mail escalation message I received on 11/7.  I must be caught in a loop.  EDIT: As of 12/2 I'm still sending logs and receiving messages to send more logs with no end in sight.<br /><br />I'm ready to return the software.  How do I get a refund since nobody is willing to help me?  I've used Quicken for years--what happened to this once great program and company?  Why does the Intuit rep respond to everyone else's review except for mine?"
0,Was forced to upgrade to premier because intuit decontented the software ( investment sales)
1,"As an intermediate computer user, I have found no other Free antivirus software that has such comprehensive coverage as Avast! Antivirus. For family and friends whose computers I have been asked to look at, I always recommend and install Avast! for them; and demonstrate how easy it is to scan and remove malware, and virus laiden operating systems. I also have Avast! on my Android cellphone. Both my cellphone and my computer are automatically updated for seamless near transparent operation except for the notifications Avast! generates to make aware that I am protected. Get your Avast! Free Antivirus Software from a trusted source like Amazon. You too can have the last laugh on spammers, scammers, and hackers."
0,"I can not believe that Quicken would put this product out for MAC users....How sad.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE take my advise and don't waste your time or money.  If I could somehow give a rating lower then 1 star I would.  I recommended to Amazon (when I called to ask for a refund) not to even sell this product on their website.  Next time I order something on line I will definitely listen to the reviews before purchasing.  I went back to my 2006 Quicken, much more complete and a lot easier to use."
0,i need a product code to activate....etc. Bottom line just purchase a hard copy the subscription is an awful waste of time!
1,Excellent product as described.  I found it very easy to install & once install the product runs & protects itself. Thanks Again installed & running well.  Would purchase from again.
1,"I have been using Quicken for many, many years. Sometimes the new versions are horrible. This new version is an actual improvement. I especially like the way the new iOS app works. The Quicken 2014 app is similar to the Mint app which makes sense since Quicken purchased Mint. I read that the security features of the Quicken app are different than the Mint security features in terms of the technology used to connect to banks. If you are concerned about security that would be worth reading up on. In my experience the only way to be secure is to have no money and never use the internet and only use cash. Otherwise, you are taking on some level of risk. I'm not qualified to advise anyone on the risks. But I think about it, and you should also. Having worked in finance IT for many years, I can tell you that your data is not secure. You just don't even want to know the crap that goes on. I think the only reason the finance system works is because people are basically honest in general.<br /><br />Back to Quicken 2014... the interface is not too different than Quicken 2013. The iOS app is much improved. I have had no problems. I like some of the other online apps like Mint, but ultimately I need the control Quicken gives me for budgeting. I tried YNAB, but it was to much data entry for me too get started when I have so much data already downloaded. This version has been more stable for me and has not crashed yet whereas 2013 did crash a couple of times. I recommend this version if you need to upgrade or plan to use the app. If you don't need to upgrade in order to use your downloads (yes, they still blackmail me every couple years by cutting off my downloads until I upgrade) and don't use apps, then you can wait for the next version."
0,Downloaded it because it was free. Went to open it up after installing it and nothing happened so I did a system restart to see if that would help. Computer wouldn't even shut down the programs properly at this point so I manually had to shut down the computer. Turned it back on and couldn't even get to my desktop. Had to manually shut the computer down again and run it in safe mode so I could do a system restore to get rid of avast. Computer worked after the system restore. Thanks for the free virus Amazon.
1,My transition from one Norton product to the next was seamless! You can never go wrong with Norton. This was a great deal - cheaper than my renewal.
1,Have been using for my computers for 6 years. Just started using for my smartphone. Best antivirus on the web.
1,PERFECT
0,"I have been using Turbo Tax for 9 years and I love it.  But 2014 Deluxe was very difficult to use.  First, my state wouldn't open.  This was after Turbo Tax supposedly fixed the state issue.  I kept trying every day, and about 3 weeks later, it finally opened.  Same thing with Its Deductible.  I wanted to use it for the estimate feature.  It wouldn't open, so again I kept trying and about a month later it finally worked.  Each time I tried to open State of Its Deductible, Turbo Tax would freeze, so I would have to shut down, and to reopen, Turbo Tax would have to restore my file.  Also, I had to forego a small credit, because I would have had to upgrade to the next level of Turbo Tax A(formerly part of Deluxe).  Even though Deluxe said I could upgrade for free, the software would not allow me to do it.  My tax situation is relatively simple, and it should have allowed me to complete my taxes in an hour or two.  I had to start over many times.    I had no problem e-fling the Federal return.  When I tried to e-file the State return, I got a message stating that my tax situation would not allow me to e-file, and I would have to print the return and file manually.  Turbo Tax did not explain  the reason.  So for the first time in 9 years, I was forced to file the state return manually.  This was very frustrating.  I never previously had issues like this with Turbo Tax.  If I don't feel reassured that 2015 has been fixed, I might look at other programs next year."
1,I was able to download Virtual XP from Microsoft site free once I upgraded to Win 7 professional with this product. The download and install was easy.

1,"Top notch antivirus and in my humble view, the best there is! I've been using it now for 2 years."
0,"Over the last 10 years Quicken became bloated. Recently I upgraded from Quicken 2010 Home & Business. My old Quicken was not a speed champion but at least I could edit transactions and software kept pace with me. Not anymore. This version is particularly bad - every click I do has a noticeable delay on screen refresh.<br /><br />Granted, over the last decade my quicken file (over 50 MB in size) accumulated tons of transactions, tens of accounts and hundreds of securities. But my recent computer is no slouch either - Core i7, 8GB RAM, Samsung SSD 830 drive, dedicated graphics, patched up-to-date Windows 7 64 bit and updated drivers. My PC can boot in seconds and flies with heavy internet browsing and MS Office and other software.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the case in Quicken 2013. New (?) budget tool is particularly slow. I do not even want to discuss how badly it is implemented. I spent like an hour trying to make it work for me, but it's no use. Older Quicken at least is responsive. Even register is slow when I click enter it takes at least half a second before I can continue.<br /><br />There are other annoyances. For instance I do not use tags, but I can not find a global switch to turn them off for all of my accounts. Instead, I had to manually do it for every account (over 20 times). Lame.<br /><br />I would need to spend more time with this new release to find out more, but my first impression is negative. This software desperately needs optimization."
1,"Had used Symantec System Works (??), which included Norton Anti-Virus, for years.  Then in the past couple or so years it seems to have morphed into Norton 360.  Have always purchased the CD previously ... until this year.  This time I purchased the download version, i.e. no CD.  Maybe just me, but don't recall having an issue in the past couple of years, but this time... installed 3 or 4 times and, afterwards, E-V-E-R-Y time it would indicate that there were 2 days remaining (should have been 360 days!!). Contacted Symantec via online chat, rep was VERY helpful, fixed in mere moments (maybe 1 minute). I was directed to open Norton from the desktop, click on a tab (sorry, don't remember which), tell Norton to update, and TA-DA!"
0,"Upgraded to 2014 in December after using various versions for years.<br /><br />The problem: the program crashes with this message: &#34;an unkown (sic) error has occurred&#34; when we attempt to download and update data from our financial institutions.<br /><br />We have spent weeks and countless hours trying to resolve this issue. Sending multiple &#34;logs&#34; as requested to customer support and talking to the worst telephone &#34;help&#34; center we've ever encountered.<br /><br />Promises to &#34;escalate&#34; the issue to some ethereal higher power (&#34;Development Team) are freely made.  Completely incomprehensible e-mails are sent to us apparently attempting to say they hope our problem has been resolved. It hasn't.<br /><br />We anticipated using 2014 for year-end and tax preparation.  Now, we just want our money back!!"
1,"When I first learned of Movavi capturing software, I wasn't sure what to think.  So I ran the trial version, and immediately fell in love with the ease of operation, a big plus!  Based solely on that , I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,Best program out there for business
0,"This product is not for professionals at all.  it might be ok for a college student just starting out but honestly, even they could get better information for free on the internet.  The videos provide generic information and are entertaining at times but you will not use this product at all if you are already in the workforce and have had professional resumes in the past."
1,"This software delivered! It was so easy to use, and it explained everything in simple instructions. I will definitely use it again next year."
1,very simple. quick download. Downloaded in one day and finished my business and personal tax return by night. Great Product. Will use again. Cheapest on Amazon as well.
1,so purpose. many use. very quality. utmost selection. most understand. very power. such skills. very doge approve. so artist. such brushes. much satisfy.
0,"I like Quicken okay. I use the Savings Accounts and really don't like the changes in the way they are being displayed. I believe I'll go back to Quicken 2011. When I installed Quicken 2013 it completely uninstalled my Microsoft Office and Outlook 2007. I finally got everything working by installing Quicken, then finishing the uninstall on MS Office and Outlook. I then reinstalled MS Office and Outlook, a real pain.<br />I honestly thought Quicken was a better product. I have enjoyed it for quite a few years, but it will be a while before I upgrade again.<br />Doug"
1,Slightly more intrusive than previous years but still OK.  Managing the licenses is a little tricky.  BUT it has consistently prevented any bugs from getting into my systems (win7 and win8)
1,Works like a charm
0,"Basically the program is fine, easy to use.  It's got some quirks but it works.  The problem is that you pay for the program.  It's $39.99 to download another state taxes.  So they make it seem that for the price you will pay to get everything you need.  I thought that was pretty high but then found when I wanted to e-file both states it was an extra $24.99 for both.  If you need to download the info for another state that's $39.99 plus another $24.99 to e-file in that state.  e-Filing State taxes is a rip-off so just print it out, mail and save yourself the $24.99."
0,I have not used it at all.  I would have returned it for the guarantee but they make the company does not have a number for returns.  They have numbers for everything else but not returns.  There were features that I liked but the import and copy and paste of recipes is horrible.  I am very disappointed and would love to have my money back.
0,"This program was purchased to replace Microsoft Money that we used on our PC to track our finances.....it is horrible, I can't get money files to load without it locking and having to force quit the program. If I had tried the trial version or ordered from the software company, I would have seen it would not work for me or received a refund since they guarantee their products for ninety days. Do yourself a favor and go to the IGG software site and try before you buy, it may be just what you are looking for.....but if it is not you won't lose any money."
1,I can never figure out or be home when renewal needs to happen and was searching for a cheaper price than the Norton site. low and behold thanks to Amazon I paid half price for the exact same item and coverage. It didn't take much to register just log on and paste the code number into the site.
1,"I downloaded, converted the data from 'Quicken Essentials', validated the totals on every account and finally started to use the application as well as the IOS application.  I have found that it does the same as Essentials plus more which I started  using as I found it now has more detail on investments, has a bill minder feature, has somewhat improved the accounts with a somewhat different look which I like.<br /><br />Overall I have found no errors in what I do (banking, savings, credit cards, loans, investments, assets) as all transferred over correctly and works together when we enter transactions.  The reports transferred and work as before and have created more reports with no problems.  All of my investment accounts transfered  from my 401's from inception in detail which is much better than before showing everything versus just totals.<br /><br />I have started using the IOS application on my iPad and it works OK, just would like to see all my accounts including investment and assets, but maybe that will come later.  Also since it is in the cloud, it would be wonderful if we had full update capability as we use the iPad on the road and it would be nice to have those transactions to reflect everything as we pay bills away from my iMac using the iPad.  I know this is a big thing, but it would be nice in the future.<br /><br />I guess overall I'm happy with the new Quicken 2015, but as always, there are other things that make sense for the application in the near future, especially the assets and investments, as that is a matter of simply transferring the details from the iMac into the cloud to the iPad.  As to full update it would be wonderful in the future on the iPad, as we would use it to keep tabs on all accounts as they happen on the road.<br /><br />Hope this helps you know how I feel about the new product.  There may be many other things people want and need, but this application functions well for what I want and need."
0,Rubbish
1,I have used this product since 2005 and it has improved every year.  This year I downloaded installed and filled out my itemized taxes in 1 hour.    No problems and got my refunds in 2 weeks with efile and direct deposit.
0,"The upgrade issue has been flogged to death, but is accurate.  I don't really mind the price increase, but discovering that the same version I've used for several years won't work is annoying.  But it was a surprise to find out that I had to upgrade my Mac OX system to make it work at all.  That was a frustrating and lenghty process (which I'm glad I didn't discover on April 14th).  It makes filing a moderately complicated return pretty easy, and I've stuck with it because it's familiar from using it for several years.  But they aren't improving it any."
1,"In my opinion, this is the BEST tax software available, so much so that I've been using it ever year since 1999!"
1,"I had Norton for years, but it slowed everything.  After using some different software the last few years, I read a highly positive review on a couple of publication websites and with the price so reasonable for 3 computers, I decided to try it again.  It's been terrific.  It pretty much does everything that I need."
0,"Quicken is a good product but it is lacking on a few levels: 1) does not support all types of accounts; 2) program has a very limited amount of instruction or walk through to help guide new users; 3) left side pane is not customizable enough (for example cash accounts and credit cards are lumped into one summary total, and it's hard to see your net worth at a glance; 4) limited support transferring in historic data; 5) Seems quite limited with advice or assistance despite having all of my financial data (for example I'd expect Quicken to suggest tax saving alternatives).<br /><br />I'm not sure if their is a better alternative to Quicken but I'm looking for it."
1,4th year I've used this program. No one in my family has complicated returns so this program was ideal for our needs.
1,Never a virus in 15 years
1,Easy download. Doing the job. Easy to reference so you can download into another computer. Thanks for the easiness lol
1,"Downloaded smoothly and works great.  Have no problems or complaints with it,  I will recommend this to anyone for purchase."
1,"This game/literature was lots of fun for my Sunday School class.  They loved it. It also reviewed the information needed<br />for the Easter lessons and up to that time. (Palm Sunday,etc.)  It was a very helpful article.  I also loved the fact that it<br />could be forwarded to others to use.  This was done and it was easy to do.  Helpful to other people too."
1,"Recently updated from Quicken Essentials for Mac... the new update is working well, several improvements are nice too.  I do not use the automatic download from financial institution features, however the rest of the features are great for keeping the household finances straight & balanced.  Very clean & intuitive interface as usual for a Mac Product - Thank you to intuit for keeping it up to date.  Used the new TurboTax 2014 for Taxes again this year - worked GREAT, including technical consult on some questions."
1,I am a repeat user of Norton products for my computers and it works fine
1,I have had avasti antivirus for 3 years and consider it one of the best. I would gladly give it five stars.
0,"I moved from 2010 to 2013.  Not much differnt, moved things around, it takes forever to load up, it takes two clicks to download stock quotes insted of one.  Not worth the $60.00."
0,None of the links this year actually go anywhere.  Otherwise the tax software worked serviceably but again there were minor issues flagged that didn't need to be.<br /><br />It is strange that many of these issues (and there were many) did not get caught in software testing.
1,Did the job
1,I have accounts with different banks.<br />For the first time I can now tell Quicken to download transactions and it will do so automatically.<br />Big time saver. Previously a small local bank could not transfer data automatically using quicken.<br />Now Quicken can properly transfer my info.
0,"I have a MAC and had to buy Microsoft Office. A friend told me about Open Office and I thought, \\""Well, since is for free...\\"" . So  I tried.  But  I rather pay for something that works than have something for free that keeps crashing when I have work to deliver.  I really would like for it to work. It doesn't.  Unfortunately i will have to pay Microsoft for their Office. :("
1,I have used this program now for the last several years and Turbotax before that. Both of them work well and ask you all the right questions.
1,easy to use and and accurate for the feds
1,"Wonderful product.  I transitioned from Windows to Mac with no problems; it read last year's data perfectly.  I chose Premier because I have one investment account statement that would take me hours to enter manually; Premier loaded it without a hitch.  Yes, I know Deluxe level used to do that and now I have pay a few $$ more to get the same functionality.  It's worth it to me.  It took me about 2 hours to enter the rest of the data manually and another hour or so to visibly check the return.  I could see no problems so eField it. Within an hour I had a text message from Intuit that my return had been accepted.  When I think about how many hours it used to take, then copy it, then mail it, then wonder---well, for me, TurboTax is a wonderful time saver. One can spend the same amount of money on a lousy dinner for two.  This is, in my opinion, a great value for the small cost each year."
1,"Excellent Video Training on the CCIE, I Think the Practice Exam could of been a little better but the price is not bad, Most other products want hundreds of dollars."
1,"I needed a screen recorder to create an online course, so I bought this yesterday, hoping all these positive reviews were correct. And you know what, they were right on! I love this program! It's much cheaper than Camtasia and a much better alternative than those &#34;free&#34; ones online that have malware and viruses attached to them. It works very intuitively and online support was quick and responsive (within two hours I got an email response that completely fixed my problem - I needed to update the drivers to my graphics card). You can choose between different screen sizes to record (or just grab your entire display if needed), press the Record button, do what you will on the screen, and then hit Stop to save. There's an option to hook up a microphone to your computer so you can speak while you record everything on the screen. I just ordered a USB microphone and will test it over the next few days to see how the audio component sounds."
1,"It's tax software. It's not particularly fun to use - last year I made a mistake and ended up restarting from scratch because it was easier than figuring out how to fix the problem - but it gets the job done.<br /><br />For my 2012 taxes I needed to handle three W2s, a K-1, and a few others. Since I also owned an S-Corporation I had to buy Turbotax Business separately to handle that (this one doesn't handle corporations) but it had no problem with my wife's sole proprietorship. Overall, doing my taxes took an afternoon, most of which was just getting my numbers together.<br /><br />The most annoying thing is that you're charged extra for doing your state taxes, but it's generally not difficult to take the printout of your federal return and use a web form to handle the state. There tend to be last-minute fixes and changes to the software every year, but that's the fault of Congress for never working things out until the last minute, and TurboTax always works well enough when I do my taxes around February."
0,must have it
0,"I like it, but I wish it wouild actually fix more things rather than just say they will be fixed if I buy an upgrade. Maybe that's too much to ask!"
1,I love the way the program walks me through the whole process.
1,Am gonna have to find my box missed the refund offer!  But the program can't be beat.  Very simple and easy to understand.
0,"Thank you all for your posts.  As I prepared to buy TT, I took the time to read your reviews..  and poof!!!  No need to purchase but instead will make other tax filings.  Wonder how Intuit will respond to this kind of bad publicity?"
1,This is a great tax program.  If I am diligent and keep my reciepts and records this is just fill in the blanks. I would recomemnd it to anyone. With this program you almost have to be an idiot to not be able to do your own taxes.
0,Does not detect adware /malware at all. Had to go get admedic from cnet (free)  for Mac to remove the ongoing pop ups
1,Works great.  Love the new features.<br />The instructions on how to download the product work well as long as the instructions are followed.
1,works.
0,"First not impressed with way it took several attempts to retrieve previous years information.  Do not like that I have to pay to have State filed, this may cause me to go to a different source next tax year, most are cheaper and do same tax filing and do not charged 19 dollars to file State."
0,It gets stuck nearly everytime I use it.  When it doesn't get stuck it doesn't remember where I was  and makes me repeat lessons I have already complete.
0,"I have email with Charter.net.  They have their own internet security suite.  In order to take advantage of an anti-spam feature, I will have to uninstall Norton 360 so I can install Charter's security suite."
1,I always Norton. I believe in it.
1,Accurate and easy to use! Recommended to anyone looking to do their taxes at home.  I will be buying it next year as well.
0,Never even heard of a version that wasn't one year at least so I didn't read the find print - 6 months!  Felt like an idiot and won't buy a thing from Norton ever again.  Any company that escorts to trickery to lower their price is like the people selling ketchup and laundry soap that reduce the weight but keep the price the same hoping nobody notices.
1,"The price of this product was better than all of the local retailers. Having it as an instant download, while the size of the file took some time to download, was convenient. The product itself is highly functional in allowing you to create documents in a variety of programs. Also having Outlook for email is a plus over the cheaper editions of this software that do not include it. Having used Office 2003 and 2007 in the past, Office 2010 is a welcome upgrade to what those offered."
1,"Very good and peace of mind protection.  It operates &#34;behind the scenes&#34;, so requires very little knowledge to keep your PC safe and running smoothly.  The mother company, of PCmatic, (PC Pitstop) has been around for years and has proved to be one of the top performers."
1,Finally a source of FREE software without hundreds of add on intrusions to your computer. Open Office is a great set of office programs and Amazon delivers then with ease!
1,very handy
0,"I'm giving up and going back to the Windows version.  But I will give Intuit a little credit - Quicken for Mac 2015 (QM15) is a good step forward from Quicken Essentials for Mac (QEM) but still far behind their Windows counterparts.<br /><br />I have used Quicken for Windows since 2007 (I've used both the Deluxe and Premier versions). However, I have now drank the &quot;Apple-aid&quot; and converted to a MacBook in 2014.<br /><br />I tried QEM in 2014, but was extremely disappointed and frustrated that I did request a refund.<br /><br />However, Intuit made me an excellent officer for QM15, so I tried it.  It was good enough that i used QM15 for about six weeks.  But still, the frustrations and disappointments kept mounting so I reverted back to Q Deluxe for Windows 2013.<br /><br />Here are some of the gaps I noted:<br /><br />Bank account reckons need help.  Transactions that are not entered exactly in the method that the bank downloads them will create new transactions during the import process.  The Windows version will attempt (and does a remarkably good job at) matching the downloaded transactions with previously entered ones.<br /><br />Investments - not being able to select a date to review the portfolio is extremely frustrating - receive a month-end brokerage statement on the 5th day of the month, and was not able to find a method to show the portfolio as of the last day.<br /><br />Reports - very lacking.<br /><br />Loan amortizations - completely missing<br /><br />On the plus side, I do like the drag and drop for transactions - enter a transaction into the incorrect account, and it can be dragged and dropped into the correct account.<br /><br />If Intuit follows their typical course of action, many feature of the Quicken 2013 products will stop working in 2016.  Hopefully their Mac products will be better by then.<br /><br />As of now, Quicken is the only program that I am using my older Windows notebook for (although I am curious to test-drive Windows 10).  So I may have an interesting decision next year as to the course I take with the Quicken Product."
0,Bought this for instant download and when I tried to register with the key Amazon provided it said this was pirated software. Would not work. DO NOT BUY.
0,Did not come with documentation which makes it extremely difficult and frustrating to determine how to do things. I should have purchased from a store such as Best Buy in order to have gotten a book.
1,"Even though the tax code seems to become more and more complex every year, TurboTax still manages to make doing your own taxes fairly easy.  The process seemed more streamlined to me this year.  I've been using TurboTax for years, so I'm sure it becomes easier each year.  I still followed the entire interview, just so I didn't miss anything that may apply to me this year.<br /><br />I got through the entire process within a couple of hours.  It helps having all of your tax-related paperwork, plus last year's tax return, all together in one place.  It also helps if you used TurboTax last year and are able to import your personal information.  In addition, many employers and payroll companies allow you to import your W-2 information.  The time savings on these two import features alone is worth the purchase.  After efiling, my return was accepted by the IRS in less than 24 hours."
1,"Haven't used it yet, but downloaded and installed it.  Most of the time I watch for deals at Best Buy or Staples and pick the best one (usually includes a gift card or some such).  This beats that price-wise easily.  I've used Taxcut for like 10 years, so it's just about the price for me and $20 is a definite buy."
0,It seemed harder than the previous editions and not as easy to navigate.
1,"I've spent a number of years filing taxes at the whims of my CPA.  Over that last couple of years I have been really over charged for relatively simple tax scenarios.  I finally took my return from my CPA, plugged the figures into Turbo Tax and compared the results. They were the same.  Turbo Tax is simple to use, walks you through your various tax situations, and imports your various form from banks and brokerage firms.  File electronically, and save that file that is then used to per-populate your next year's returns.  Using Turbo Tax has empowered me to learn more about my own taxes, and I can complete my own returns in about 1/2 hour.  Now I'm trying to understand why my CPA was charging me 2 to 2.5 hours to complete my taxes.<br />Turbo Tax is great and Amazon give you a good discount on the product.  I've never had a problem downloading it and both Tubro Tax and Amazons support is excellent.  Kudos!"
1,"I bought this product for my 6 year old daughter because it was too painful to watch her continue to 'peck' at the keyboard anytime she needed to type something.    She LOVES it.  After we got it, she actually begged me every day to play it.  Sometimes she would get frustrated because she wasn't getting enough right on the practice typing or the games would go to quickly, but that is just something that needs to be practiced.     One complaint is that it allows you to enter a target speed and it actually recommends you be at 14wpm in a section before you move on, but it doesn't seem to stop you from actually continuing on whether you meet that criteria or not.  So if you, as a parent, are not making sure they meet that goal, they can just keep going forward and perhaps end up too frustrated to continue learning at all.    My husband and I also had fun trying the product to see where our WPM was at and would actually have races against each other to see who could type faster.  It was fun. :)    I definitely recommend this product."
1,people say the anti virus companies make the viruses to sell their products.if that's true then why is an excellent anti-virus like avast given for free.great stuff.
1,Easy to install. It took longer than we anticioated but we were able to use it right away and the download worked just as needed.
0,"I had Quicken 2011 and wasn't planing to purchase any newer product from Quicken. When they informed me that 2011 would no longer be supported, I thought I should try and upgrade to 2014. When I loaded it, I noticed it looks exactly like 2011 Premier and that truly, nothing has changed. The mobile syncing is terrible, so I don't even believe I'm going to use this feature. It's exactly like the free app of &#34;mint&#34; and is much more difficult to use than mint. I don't know how quicken got this so wrong. I'm truly upset that I wasted so much money on this and I will get no use out of it at all."
0,"Stinks!!~  I needed to download the upgrade, got charged $43.44 and now it appears I will not even get the $25 promised...there is something<br />wrong with a company that changes their product knowing full well it will have a negative impact on returning customers.  I will look for another provider next year....this is at least my 10th year using this product."
1,I had been using me security essentials and got a nasty adware bug that was so bad I had to disconnect from the internet just yo even turn on my laptop. Downloaded Norton and it took care of it on the 1st scan. I'll never use anything else again.
0,"Code does NOT work! \\""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again.\\"" and again, and again, and again...............NG."
1,"This does everything I expected for the price. When the sound did not work on the instructional videos, the help email function actually worked and they sent me information to trouble shoot and eventually change the settings in my computer sound acceleration (?) to allow the videos to be heard.<br />The actual software is easy to use, especially after watching about a half hour of video tutorials. More details can be learned with more video watching.<br />It allowed me to create landscape contours and see how my proposed home would fit into it. It allowed easy changes to the home design, changing room sizes, wall materials, ceiling heights, window placements, etc.. Then it was easy to fill it with appliances and furniture and make sure walk through room was available, sight lines for doors and pass throughs were what I planned. You could even change wall colors, tiles, and cabinet knobs and other details.<br />If you need the professional version for whatever reason, it does have more options. But this had enough that I could envision and then create what I wanted. That will save a lot of money when I hand over my plans to an engineer and we do not have to make a hundred changes while his time clock is charging me. Or, worse, changes to the plans as the house is being built and even a little change is hugely expensive."
0,"I too had been a loyal TurboTax customer since the 90's.  This year I had to purchase the &#34;Premier&#34; version to get Schedule D.  TurboTax has been the most expensive software option for quite some time, but I had come to expect that, knowing that I could still independently select the services applicable to my situation.  No longer.  Intuit's decision to pursue a sales and marketing strategy requiring expensive upgrades to secure common functionality requires that I switch to a more principled provider that may better appreciate customer loyalty.  This will be my last purchase of an Intuit product - H&R Block will be the beneficiary of my business (and that of my extended family) in future years."
1,"I just downloaded TurboTax Home & Business (for tax year 2009) from Amazon.  Despite the initial negative reviews talking about TurboTax's bugginess, I needed to purchase the product today (12/31) so that I could take the expense deduction on my 2009 tax return.  I've followed the prices for a while and seen them decline.  The $73.62 price that I paid to download probably won't be the lowest, but if last year's price history chart is any indication, the price will bottom somewhere around $65 in mid-January before jumping back up into the mid $90's around February 1st when everyone gets their W-2 forms and are ready to actually do their taxes.    The download from Amazon was fast and flawless, and I do mean fast.  I have Comcast internet and all 85 MB was downloaded to my computer in slightly less than a minute.  I know that the Amazon website says 105 MB, but the Amazon downloader only stated 85 MB.    Installation also occured flawlessly on my computer running XP.  Upon executing, the software downloaded the latest updates from Intuit flawlessly.  Once the program was up and running, I imported 2008's return, added my password, and saved.  I won't do anything else until I receive my W-2's in late January.  By then I expect Intuit to probably have another update to improve/fix anything else.    I've been using TurboTax for my Home & Business since 2004 and have never been dissapointed with the software.  The only thing that I was dissapointed with was the price that I was charged as a returning Intuit TurboTax customer.  I believe that Intuit charges about $106 including shipping.  Needless to say, I'm quite happy paying $73 and getting the same software."
1,"I liked the fact that Amazon let you download this. It was quick, simple and easy to do. Not having to wait in for the post or me losing the discs was perfect. Norton 360 really does have everything you could want and more and is a must for those who want to protect their PC. To have Norton up and running within a couple of minutes of purchase was amazing."
1,"I've used Turbotax Basic for several years, and it does the job for me even though I have some stocks and bonds and itemize my deductions. However, the Basic version is not easy to find. The Intuit website pushes the Deluxe version as their lowest level software. Naturally, Deluxe is more expensive.     Some of the office supply stores don't seem to have Basic though they may offer it later on. The only place I found Basic available now was on Amazon."
1,"Very easy to set up...the download site keeps account of how many and which machines you have the software installed on. Also, you can easily configure the operating settings. I like all the feature that are included other than just anti-virus detection!"
1,"I've been looking for software that has exactly this functionality (interactive recording). Before i found this tool, I was planning to create my own but luckily I found this application<br /><br />Pros<br />- lightweight...and not resource intensive<br />- able to record and type at the same time....saved a lot of money from transcription cost<br />- able to playback on a word by word basis<br />- ideal for users that take notes at a meeting with a PC or tablet. Able to help recall what the meeting was about...extremely useful<br />- you can demo the software before you buy<br /><br />Cons<br />- some bugs but they are being resolved through each new release - sames as all software<br />- for the windows version, need to have a separate mic or the keyboard sound will be quite annoying during playback...still better than  traditional note taking...<br />- not integrated with Microsoft word...but is okay as a note taking app.<br /><br />Anyway - I would recommend this to anyone especially if you are in the consulting business."
0,"It keeps crashing while editing few clips of few seconds each. It crashes while doing simple tasks, such as trimming, adding effects, adding a keyframe.....  I bought it as quick alternative to more complex video applications. The idea was to use it for simple edits, to get some video out quickly and easily, when I don't need much editing. I tried few times with same results. It ends up being a waste of time (and money!!!). I will look at other applications for my basic edits.  I wish I could get my money back :("

1,Really like the turbo tax products.  I feel safe and confident sending in returns when using them.  Will use them again
0,"I downloaded this to help with all of the junk that ends up on my computer. It took quite a long time to load but don't know if it's the program ormy computer. It helped moderately but my computer still runs slow, again not sure if my computer or the program not doing it's job. I probably would not purchase again."
1,Love it again
0,"No , the single objective for PC matic is to get you to spend money so that they can fix your computer on line. After refusing to give them any more money they eventually installed it my first computer. I called back for the second computer and they tried the same thing , so I hung up on them .  (Four more calls to go)"

1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for many years. It helps me find all my income and deductions, and it is easy to work with. It offers either a fully guided format, but also allows you to enter the program at any point to review, make additions, or correct entries. IRS approved deductible values are provided for all your non-cash contributions, charitable and medical mileage.<br />You are required to provide the official street address for all charities you donate to, and I would recommend that you have proof of every donation and any milage claimed."
0,"After paying for this alright product, can not believe all the ads!  This should be called Ads for Systemcare Pro v5."
1,The download was straightforward and generated the same files I had seen in previous years.  I see no reason to pay more for a CD I will use only once.
1,"Quickbooks Pro works for me. I am self employed and run many aspects of the business myself. Quickbooks makes it easy to invoice my customers,pay my bills,  run reports and accept payments no matter how it's paid. Cash, check, CC or accept on line payments."
1,Great tool to store all my files on my desktop. I was using in on my account. Now I want to add this to my father account. So he would store his photos.

0,"1/4/14 My original title was &#34;Upgrade ok from 2010 to 2013 R11 22.1.11.31 on W7Prox64&#34;  Please note the update at the bottom. I hate this software with a passion only because it works well for a long time then randomly loses all of my CC transactions and 6 mos worth of other data. miserable software and in all the years i have used it this might be the worst issue yet. Looking for another software that will not waste my life. ====== So far so good. I just connect to banks, process invoices, attach scans to payments, and run yearly reports.  Upgrade went smoothly, very easy. Did not have to re enter anything. Running on a netbook w 2GB RAM, SSD, 1024x600 res. i have downloaded statements, backed up, validated, all without issue thus far. I made a copy of my data before upgrading just in case. I won't even bother with the mobile app sounds like a headache.  Have had my share of issues and frustrations w Intuit/Quicken in the past and it is lame they force you to upgrade. in any event it seems to be doing what I need it to so far and I actually like the subtle GUI changes they made.  EDIT: The invoice screen is now just too large to show the options across the bottom like save and print, etc. This was not an issue in 2010 and in 2013 the window cannot be resized. From the &#34;Memo&#34; field it is 7 TABs to Print, and 8 to &#34;Save and New&#34;, 9 clicks to save and close i think. i wish the windows worked in fullscreen or could be resized a little- there is plenty of empty space to make it fit on my netbook screen.  UPDATE 4/12/13 Tax time and guess what? Quicken has obliterated the last 2 months of 2012 and the first 2 months of 2013. No data. All zeros. So sick of Quicken and Intuit all these years and it still loses data and fails.  UPDATE 1/4/14 Entering payments. one kept showing in the Unpaid Invoices List. Very odd. Deleted the payment after trying reboot, validate. Ended up having to enter the payment TWICE to get it do clear. Then I notice all of myuncategorized transactions from my CC are missing- then I notice it ALL is missing back to JULY 2013!!! Speechless. i have had quirks before but this is just inexcusable. This is on a decent machine with an SSD hard drive etc. I must find another software- this is going to be painful to fix. What good is a financial management software you cannot simply trust to maintain the integrity and entirety of your work and data.  UPDATE 8/2015 Open up the program and a bunch of checks and transactions are just missing. I verify and back up and close properly and often. I have an SSD that writes changes quickly. Data is only 1 year now not multiple- ie very small. I really hate this software. I would pay good money for an alternative that would connect to my banks."
1,love it very good.

1,Good
1,"Excellent product!  I started using this product when it was called Tax Cut.  The past few years they decided to stay with the H & R Block name but no changes in the actual product.  Past few years I waited until March and downloaded it from Amazon.  Usually, like this year, it had a GREAT price attached to it.  Download is fast and install is a breeze."

0,Thank goodness for Amazon. If you try to purchase from Kaspersky website they are deceptive and automatically add items to your cart plus they embed and add an auto renewal plan to your credit card. So 5 stars for Amazon and 1 star for Kaspersky. They need to clean up their unethical selling practices.

1,"Our company owns a TV channel for publicizing our company and informing our clients about the latest promotions and events. So we can make a bound with our customers. But the problem is video shot by Sony camera can’t do following edits in normal edit software, like FCP, Avid mc , Adobe Premiere. This is so frustrating that we want to add some effects and our company’s logo watermark on our videos. And then upload them on our website. Except this can’t import problem, the uploading is also a big Obstruction for us. In order to solve all these problems, we desperately need an convert tool to help us. We googled and Pavtube shed a light on our troubles. With this tool , we can output the format which these edit software support and compress the size of them almost without quality loss. Now I can say , it is indispensable to our work."

1,"I really Like this product, light on your PC and do the job. I may consider to get the paid one"
1,"Downloading it was a run-around. I found the most straight-forward way to do it was go to adobe.com and download the trial version. Then when it asks you if you want the trial or if you have a serial number, enter in the serial number. Otherwise, once it's downloaded, it's amazing."
0,"I bought this program for video editing. It was the worst program I have used. When I import a video file it will automatically try to correct the aspect ratio, then the pitch of the video will change. It was very weird. I called customer service and they gave me a refund because they could not find a solution for the problem. This program has been around too long for them not to get it right."

1,"I have been using Quick Books - and prior to that Quicken - for 30 years.  As an accountant, I like to find the quickest, easiest way to do things right.  Quick Books provides my required detail for my accounting purposes, but is easy to set up for the layman to use to input the data - so I don't have to do it all!<br />Some items I would change, but not to a huge extent.  The upgrades take a little getting used to, but overall they improve the functions of everyday bookkeeping.<br />Keep up the good work!!"

This year as my &#34;freebie&#34; was up, I downloaded the product versus ordering the discs and guess what Crash & Burn again, I immediately ripped the software out of my computer, had to restore it and Amazon provided a refund . . .  need I say more, wink, wink ?"
1,"I am happy with hitfilm. It is a very powerful editing and vfx system for a low cost. I've been working with video software for a while, and hitfilm is just as powerful as its contenders (After Effects) and it cost much less. I would recommend hit film to people just getting started in videos/film, hobbyist, and even professionals."
1,Have been using quicken for about 10 years. I have always found it helpful and easy to use.
1,"I have used Norton exclusively for 7 years and I have found it to be an excellent product.  I especially like the Norton Online Family aspect of it where it notifies you when an inappropriate site was blocked for a child based on their age.  It is great! You can see everywhere your children have visited, videos watched, etc.  Absolutely fantastic!"
1,"Loved this program, this was the first time I had used it and it was so easy."
1,This is a must have for the serious amateur who wants to spend their money on lenses. This is a powerful program that rivals the Full Photoshop and surpasses Photoshop elements. Actually I have this and Photoshop Elements and while they overlap a lot there are things that one can do that the other can't. So I have both for less than one third the cost of full Photoshop.
1,"Good software, I like it!"

Way to gouge loyal customers, Intuit!  And such hollow apology, clearly forced because of customer and media backlash.  I am looking at alternatives as we speak!  I hereby declare Intuit a Darwin Award winner- the one that goes to people who do astoundingly dumb things whereby removing themselves from the gene pool."

0,BAD BAD BAD ! ! ! !
1,"I've been a loyal Turbo Tax user for years, but this year their business model has apparently changed and for the worse. They're prices have gone up, and their software makes it difficult to choose the less expensive options. The frustration with Turbo Tax led me to start all over, after investing a considerable amount of time, to another option, H&R Block. It costs less than half the amount and included state tax return, and it was very user friendly. Do yourself a favor, and give Turbo Tax the heave-ho they deserve. Good-bye Turbo Tax and hello H&R Block."
1,"No problems at all.  Amazon was a breeze.  Turbotax now at a better price and with E-File included.  Still the best.  Although the price was high and no E-File before, But as usual Turbotax is the BEST"
1,i have had avast for years now and have had great luck with it i would recommend it to anyone
1,I like windows 2013 used it for a month in the demo state then when I found out you could buy cards and downloads and not have to keep a credit card on file for auto bill with microsoft I and the fact that you can download this on up to 5 PC/Mac's makes it a great deal and worth the price in my book.<br /><br />The one major draw back I have is that my main computer is a Mac and they didn't update the mac version of Office its still the 2011 version...<br /><br />I have a laptop and a tablet and my work PC and really dig the look and feel of  office 2013/365 on them but not upgrading the look and feel of the mac version was a let down.<br /><br />If you have more than one computer this is totally worth it.  I also like the fact that its per PC not per account on the PC I have a work profile and home profile on my laptop and was glad to see that Microsoft didn't count both as there own install.  could have been a little better on Mac but I understand I didn't really buy a mac to use Microsoft products anyway. I used to be a hardcore PC guy loved XP but Vista made me move to Mac windows 7 brought me back and Windows 8 if not for the (Start Menu 8) Program I found to bring the windows 7 start menu would have made me run back to my Mac...For now all the electronics in my house Mac and PC seem to be Co-existing peacefully.
1,"I've used several other Windows system maintenance products and haven't used one for many years because I didn't trust any of them. They've all caused problems when I've let them do everything they want to do, and it takes way too much time to pick and choose from hundreds of registry errors, unneeded files, etc. One of those products rendered my system unbootable, which was a pain to fix, and one of them actually had a class action suit filed against it because some of its functions didn't do anything. Recently, I offered to help with a friend's computer that was running very slowly and freezing up. I only had it for a couple of days and didn't have time to fix everything by hand. So I installed and ran the trial version of Advanced SystemCare. It improved performance a lot and didn't screw anything up. As far as I know, the system hasn't had a single freezeup or blue screen since I gave it back. I now have activated versions running on my own computers. It takes a substantial leap of faith to let one of these things loose on a system on which you depend. So far, this one does what it's supposed to and hasn't caused a single problem. It's quite obvious to me which functions are included in the package (a lot) and which are optional upgrades. The &#34;Action Center&#34; tab offers huge discounts on the &#34;pro&#34; versions of the anti-malware, driver updater, and defragger. So far, I haven't needed them but the prices are so low ($3.99 to $5.99) it seems foolish not to take advantage of them. I've read the reviews from people who have had problems with the product and my guess is that their systems were massively screwed up to begin with. You can do a lot of damage with an admin account if you have no idea what you're doing and there are no system maintenance products that perform miracles."
0,While i purchased this norton protection plan for one year its already  expired in march...
1,Great product but had a hard time downloading on second computer. Love all of Norton's products. Good value for peace of mind.
0,"I lost $30 on Norton Security.<br />Never again will I nor my students buy Norton.<br />Help comes from foreign lands; and will they help you for  money.<br />This is greed unvarnished.<br />When my subscription is over, Norton is over.<br />Amzon you should be more careful."
0,I will never buy a Quicken product again. This version does not upgrade properly. It is very slow and freezes constantly and I can't see how it is any different from the previous version I was forced to upgrade. What a rip off!
1,"I just upgraded from the 2011 version of Quickbooks. My first impression from the software is a good one. The interface has been overhauled to the point where navigation is truly easy. Quickbooks 2011 had a lot of clutter to the interface and wasn't very organized. Quickbooks 2013 surprised me at how quick and easy it is to access your customer database, inventory database, sales orders and so on. I was very reluctant to purchase this software based on the reviews I saw on this site but I went ahead anyway out of need. This was a very good move.<br /><br />I still don't like that they try to sell services within the software itself. Nag screens and so on. Overall it is a 4 of 5."
1,"Just finished my taxes.  I have been using Turbo Tax Deluxe for years but this year after purchasing the Deluxe, I found that I would need the Premier to finish my taxes.  After contacting TurboTax, they were so kind and told me that when I got to the point in completing my taxes and needed the premier to finish, they upgraded what I had installed at no cost.<br />I have always been happy with TurboTax as it really saves me a lot of time of duplicating the filling out of pages.  It does all the adding and subtracting and so much work.<br />A satisfied customer."
1,Great price and easy to follow.
1,No problems. And received our refunds timely. Must be IRS is happy with what you do.
0,"Would not import my QuickBooks 2014 company file, which was the only reason I shelled out the extra $ rather than purchasing H&R Block."
1,"The software was good; a little simpler than turbotax.  Only problem that I had was with a software update.  I kept trying to do the update, but it would not complete. I finally completed it the following day.  It may have been related to a Windows software update that had to be completed on my computer."
1,"I work in IT, self- employed, full time.  One of the many services I offer is malware remediation.  I have many tools that I use to rip out viruses and other malware, and I regularly test those tools with malware samples I download.  I will also deliberately go to malicious websites to get a look at what tricks they're trying to pull.  What that means is I spend a lot of time going places with my computers that I shouldn't be going, and doing things that are dangerous.  I used to use a three-tiered system for keeping my PCs malware free.  Meaning, I would run a memory-resident antivirus program (e.g. Trend Micro or McAfee), coupled with a separate memory-resident antispyware program (such as Webroot).  The third tier was a standalone scanning tool, such as Malwarebytes, with which I would do full-disk scans once or twice a week.<br />  I started using Norton 360 about four years ago.  Over time, I realized that my standalone malware scans were finding nothing.  I eventually dropped them altogether.  Likewise, I found that Norton would grab trojans and other non-virus malware as quickly or even more quickly than the antispyware programs I was using.  For the past three years I have been using Norton 360 alone, and I have never had a single incident of malware successfully implanting itself and running on any machine I use Norton on.  And, as I said, those are machines that frequently get exposed to malicious websites, emails, and other malware vectors.<br />  I make a great deal of money ripping viruses out of infested machines.  For those who might balk at paying the price for a commercial security suite like Norton, let me tell you it's a false economy when you use free antivirus and skip paying for a commercial suite.  That thirty or forty bucks looks like a lot of money.  But if your machine gets infested, you're going to pay someone like me a lot of money to either thoroughly clean your computer, or to rescue as many files as possible, then wipe it and reinstalleverything.  It will cost you a lot more than thirty or forty bucks.<br />  One more thing I've seen: many viruses and other malware programs are adept at disabling antivirus and other security programs you have on my computer.  I've seen it happen most often with the various free security suites that are available.  But I've also seen malware rip the guts out of expensive commercial security suites like Kaspersky and McAfee.  I have never--never--seen Norton 360 get crippled by malware.  Not saying that it couldn't happen, just that I've never seen it happen.  And I do this for a living.<br />  Finally, in addition to strong antimalware and firewall programs, with this suite you also get useful backup and optimization utilities.  The best part about that is the Norton program can tell when your PC is idle, and it does all of its backup and optimization tasks during those idle periods.  Meaning, no more having to leave your PC turned on overnight on specific days so it can run a backup job or defrag your hard drive.  That all gets done in the background and on the fly.  No hands needed.<br />  What else can I say?  I'm an IT professional and I run Norton on every one of my Windows devices.  In fact I just purchased yet another 1-year license, so I can continue to work and surf under the umbrella of the best protection available.  And next year, I will do it again."
1,"I enjoyed using this Antivirus software.<br /><br />I updates, &#34;behind the scenes&#34; and seems to correct anything wrong.<br /><br />I think it &#34;catches&#34; most stuff and I am happy with the product.<br /><br />It serves my minimal needs."
1,"I picked Turbotax last year to prepare the taxes for myself and some other family members. Great program. Simple, accuate, and it lets you e-file five returns, which is great when you are helping family members with thier taxes. And this year it came with a credit on Quicken which paid for my upgrade! That was just great."
1,2014 Deluxe worked well as turbo tax always does.....been using software for years
0,Caution. If you buy this version and have any stock transactions it will not allow you to e-file your returns. You will have to print and mail them. There is no caution that you must buy the Premier version which is only a few dollars more BUT if you buy it as an upgrade from within the Deluxe version its $30 more. TurboTax should be ashamed of their bait and switch marketing
0,"Intuit is terrible.  I don't mind paying the premium for TurboTax vs competitors like TaxAct, but only if it works!<br />I file for a NYS multi-member partnership.  There's only a week before the deadline, and the program still doesn't support e-filing NYS partnership return!  The e-filing has been delayed like this every year, but this is the first time it's been delayed so much.<br />Not only that, but there has not been a clear communication on when or if NYS e-filing will be supported.<br />AND not only that, but if I want to print it out to simply mail it in..I can't!  There is no option to print it out unless I dig through a menu of options to find some non-sensical workaround.  Again, terrible!<br />I've been a TurboTax customer for 4 years.  But that's it. No more."
1,Consistently easy to use. I have used for close to 10 years straight and love it. Definitely would recommend it.
1,The market leader!
1,"Adobe Premiere Elements is a stripped-down version of Adobe's very professional video editing software. I bought this because I was fed up with other video editing software on my Macbook Pro. I still burn DVDs of my video projects and appreciate that feature in Adobe's product.<br /><br />First off, Adobe Premiere Elements, like all video editing, is a memory hog, so you must have a quick processor, an adequate video card, and plenty of memory to make the app run efficiently. I run 8 GB of memory which seems to be adequate.<br /><br />Likes:<br />The interface is fairly intuitive. There are several themes that you can download to create menus for DVDs and BluRay. It will correctly compress videos to fit on disc. It exports clips and movies in a wide variety of formats. It's easy enough for quick editing projects. It is more robust than iMovie.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />This still runs slowly, even with the 8 GB of memory. It tends to crash occasionally, so it may not be 100% compatible with Mac OS 10.9. Processing large videos take a lot of time. Admittedly, it takes a lot of time for any video editing software, especially on a laptop. Burning DVDs can take an extraordinarily long time. I use disc images to make duplicates, instead of using Adobe Premier.<br /><br />The reason I give this app five stars is that it really is the better video editing software that I've used, compared with six others, including iMovie."
1,"If you have a more complex tax return, get the product that is the most deluxe.  I have found in years past that if I didn't get the right version, there would not be enough room for the rentals and on some it doesn't ask the question at all.  The Deluxe version seemed to have everything I needed to complete my return last year.  The product comes with five free return submissions which makes it an especially good deal (I usually have to re-submit my return at least once).  Another really great thing about this product is they have a free \\""live chat\\"" feature where you can chat with a person about the product who actually knows what they are talking about for once.  I have used it a few times and was pleased.  I have not used \\""live chat\\"" for actual tax law questions and I do not know if they provide that."
1,Great - So Far SO GOOD!!!!<br /><br />Seems to be a very NICE and GOOD anti-virus protection product-service!!!!<br /><br />Using AVAST! Free Antivirus for over 2 years so far with no bad problems which I greatly appreciate!!!

1,Was done in 20 min. Great App!
0,"The Rosetta stone is a great learning tool and fun HOWEVER, this download does not come with an activation code that I could find, so it only lets you do up to unit one lesson two. That is less than an eighth of what the product should be. Other than that big problem, it is great, and it may be that I possibly missed the activation code somehow."
1,"I run a basic scan every night and am pleased with the results.  Not often, but even once is enough for me, avast! finds a virus and handles it.<br /><br />The other feature is in the active mode, if I venture off to a bad site avast! catches it immediately warns.<br /><br />I was vulnerable to viruses and malware and had several repairs.  Now with avast! I have not had a problem for over two years."
1,The software has easy to follow instructions on a step by step basis. I highly recommend this software for this reason.
0,Not Useful Found only one driver.<br />Another driver update that found four drivers to update that I need to use. I might consider Purchasing that one.To resolve my driver issue.<br />Disappointing  Program.
0,"Don't buy at all, takes FOREVER to lock and unlock, go with McAfee Vault.  Doesn't work well at all and not user friendly"
0,"I'm a CPA and I purchased this for the ability to sync to my iPad.  It doesn't work and based on the other reviews online, this is not an isolated problem.  Other than that, I like the software."
1,"I purchased this for a kitchen redesign for myself.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, the learning curve is not that steep. If you are computer savvy and use windows based software regularly, then do not fear getting your hands dirty with this software. The instantaneous three dimensional renderings which this software can create are simply superb. The built-in libraries of cabinets and appliances are adequate to get the design to 90 percent completion before you first set foot inside a cabinet store. One suggestion - It would be good to have your appliance sizes narrowed down before you play around with your kitchen layout. (Note - I have uploaded some 3-D renderings under the customer images. These were working renderings which were generated within a few hours of learning to use the software.)"
1,"Hi, I'm the Gingerbread Man, I gave Avast Antivirus protection a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The Avast antivirus application informs me daily of upgrades to protect against the ever expanding viral threats that our PCs are exposed to. So I know that this company's layers run deep.  The one time in five years of turning it off and forgetting to turn it back on in a 12 hour period my hard drive became infected and nonresponsive.  I was able to start my PC in safe mode and bring Avast back on line.  I was back up and surfing the internet in no time after that. Now my motto is: &#34;Don't go On Line Without It.&#34;<br /><br />There is literally no one I would'nt recommend Avast Antivirus software to."
1,"Completely flawlessly, took about 35 minutes from start to finish.  no issues at all.  Works like a charm and much less expensive than the actual disc to house treatment."
0,"If you need to file a state return DON'T buy this product.  For only $1.30 you get the state included with another version.  Not clear at all.  Not understanding that, I bought this and then I had to pay $39 for a state return (plus another $20 to efile with state).  So my cost went from $40 to $100. Don't make the same mistake,  I would have bought another company's product if I knew these 'hidden' costs would be added on..."
1,Program found additional deductions. The state forms were provided for mail in options saving money instead of using efile method for additional cost.  Just followed step by step questions and no problems occurred with filing.  Was a past user but returned this year after problems with free programs last couple years.  Will return to turbo tax next year for filing.
1,We have used TurboFax for several years and have found it to serve our needs well. We originally purchased it to check against our CPA's figures to see if it would work for us. It saved about $250 for us and we have used it since. Our needs dictate the Premier version. We have recommended it to many friends.
0,"It was purchased to replace a much older version of Print Shop that was used frequently by a shut-in to make calendars and mailing labels but would not read any of the older created files. It also would not permit the creation of a new calendar that could be updated yearly and give the option of keeping the already entered Family b-days and yearly consistent date entries. Everything had to be re-entered for the new year. (Not Cool on either item, especially not being able to import your own older files))"
1,AWESOME PRODUCT
1,"I bought this program to brush up the color-balance for diving pictures which I failed to take RAW, and my programs couldn't tweak JPG.  It works great and I use it now almost entirely.  Only drawback is that recently it stopped working and requires a new installation.  This could be a result of me uninstalling some other 'old crap' on the computer.  Assuming the latter, The program kept the fifth star.  Great for the price."
1,It did the job in a well structured program. I was lead through the process in an orderly fashion. I recommend this product.
1,"So far it works fine, no issues going from 2014 version. Haven't used it enough to say anything about new features. Obviously happy with Quicken in general as I've been using it for 10 or more years."
1,Very good price.
0,"If you have multiple users of a computer (like most families), this product will not work for you because you need to install it and can only use it for only ONE of those users.<br /><br />Everyone has to log in under that one user to access Word, Excel, etc. but you still need to return to your own user account if you then want to use your email!<br /><br />So that's why it's totally not functional - you cannot simply type a document then enclose and email it, doing the whole thing on your own user account.<br /><br />I did spend about 6 hours on phone (including one 49 minute stretch on hold) and online chats trying to work around this, but the best they could offer was creating an Alias for the main user.  Well guess what?  The Alias cannot be an existing email account, you have to make a new one, which is not a user on the computer, so we're back to square one.  Now I have 3 users, 5 email accounts, and still only one person in the family can open Word on their user account.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this product."
1,Love it! I've used Quicken for years.
1,Worked as always.
0,Some movies record as advertised but Netflix movies will not sync the sound with the pictures.  I am using the software to record some black & white documentaries.  I basically made this purchase to record Netflix movies - and it doesn't work.  I do not want a refund because it works in black & white but I wish the Moviebox would work as advertised.  Thanks for the opportunity to complain a little.  ( I have Windows 8.1 )
1,It's great particularly if you have done your taxes with TurboTax in the past.  I love the way it inhales your old data and let you change only what is different from the previous year.  The walk-thrus are really helpful in asking questions in a manner that doesn't require you to understand tax speak.  Be careful using your copy of TurboTax to do someone elses taxes.  All though the program even encourages you to do it you will be charged $39.99 to complete a state tax for that other person plus the $19.99 filing fee.  I completed the 2nd Federal tax fine but then you get hit with the $39.99 extra to do the state.
1,The 2015 version has the Web Cam alert when the web cam is in use.  Nice to know should an unauthorized person enables it. I have used Kaspersky for 4 years and I am happy with the product.
1,Avast is a great free antivirus program and I have recommended it to everyone I know. It catches all the bad that I have come across.
0,It was a little misleading. I couldn't down load it from my phone which I needed because my computer was having a problem with the Internet and I was trying to fix that.
1,Worked out great for me. And I don't have just a run of the mill 1040EZ return. I thought it was very easy to go through and this was my first year doing my own taxes. Got tired of going to H&R Block and getting bent over.
1,These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.
0,Those who say it is just as easy as Turbo Tax must be Accountants.  I am sorry I switched even though Turbo Tax is screwing their customers.
1,"It does what it claims to do - manages your bank accounts on your computer.  You just click \\""update\\"" and it automatically downloads your transactions.  It just works and does it simply and well."
0,Good
1,"Turkish is not an easy language, I'm finding.  Buit, honestly, this is a great way to learn.  I am enjoying it!"
1,My 3rd year of using Turbo Tax and I highly recommend it. All the right questions get asked and the program is very easy to understand and use.
1,"Great product, easy to install and use and this package for the great price on Amazon Daily Deals.  For a really good basic home package this Corel product has surpassed my initial thought on the package.  I used the easy download from Amazon and the program installed properly with the added bonus of being able to be retrieved from the Amazon Library if I need to re-install."
0,so so
0,"I've used Quicken for a number of years to keep track of personal finances on my local machine as I don't care to store all my financial data in one place in the cloud. Being able to download transactions from various banks and import them is a key feature for me and has been great. After upgrading from 2011 to 2014, I find that I am REQUIRED to create an Intuit ID before I am allowed to do any automatic updating from my banks. Moreover, I'm also not allowed to import files I've manually downloaded from banks without creating said ID.<br /><br />There is no reason that this needs to be a requirement to use what I would consider a core feature of the software. If you're OK with creating such an account, Quicken has otherwise treated me well over the past several years and I'm sure that this would do the same."
0,Bad Product! Incurs much more tax!<br />I used both &#34;H&R Block Tax Software&#34; and &#34;H&R Block Online Tax Preparation&#34; to see if there is any tax difference.<br />It ends up with $354 more tax liabilities when using the tax software!<br />Now I learn that cheap product may cost you more. Totally wasted my money.
1,"Not much change from 2013.  However, application seems to perform faster.  Great improvement with updating the cloud to us my mobile devices."
0,Don't like it because I can't install it properly. McAfee thinks it is a virus and keeps it in quarantine. Would like to get the cd or my money back.
1,Love it!
1,"as a college student, this has saved my life and my wallet! I was considering just biting the bullet and buying the &#34;home and student&#34; version at best buy ($140!!!) This was much cheaper, and does everything you need out of Microsoft Office."
1,At first I was skeptical but after download and a about 10 conversions for my I pad and other devices  I have to say I Like it Its easy simple to use and has lots of choices.  I would definitely recommend.
1,It does a good job a managing my money.  Don't know what I would do about keep all those different things separated without it.
1,"I love having this for my Macbook Air, because I have never owned a Mac before so all of my other documents were in word format and I did not want to worry about formatting issues when I transferred documents from my windows laptop to my Mac. The price was better from Amazon and it downloaded quickly."
0,"No reason that I will/wish to share... On second thought, I changed my mind. I do have one comment: Whatever happened to the saying,  \\""the customer is always right?\\"". Because my experience in ordering this product online, did not end that way."
0,"I had used early versions of Broderbund's 3D Home Architect years ago and have been frustrated by newer versions and every other similar product I've tried since.  I bought Home Designer Suite 2015 because it bared a strong resemblance to the old Windows 95-98 Broderbund product that was so easy to use.  After using this for a few minutes it became clear that this is the same software.  I'm sure it's had bells and whistles added, but at it's core, it's the same software.  All the tool buttons I'm already familiar with are there.  All the object options work the same.<br />My reaction is mixed.  I'm thankful to have this easy to use software working on my Windows 7 laptop without any hassles, but on the other hand why should a rehashed piece of software from the late 90's be so expensive?<br /><br />5 stars for the software, but I have to knock off two stars for the price."
0,"When I downloaded this software, all the short cuts appeared on my desk top.  Not just one icon that you could click and open it up to use.  So, now my desk top is super cluttered.  So, it is okay but kind of disappointing."
1,"Norton keeps my computer virus free, but occasionally I get error messages that require me (If I am interpreting them correctly) which seem to say, &#34;Go to a certain site to see if you have a vires.&#34;  I follow the instructions, but then get no feedback as to what was wrong or if anything has been fixed."
1,Amazon saved me a bundle on the Norton 360. Plus Norton helped me get my computer in better working order. It was a wonderful purchase all the way around.
1,This product helped me revise and update my resume. It had more features then I expected a resume program to have.  I recommend it to others.
1,"Doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that Microsoft office has, but the price is right and works for great for my applications."
0,"this did the job as far as actually completing the taxes.  However, navigation between forms, etc was not good at all.  I have used the free fill in Federal forms in the past, and the navigation between forms was infinitely better."
0,"Been using this product for years. Read the reviews and I am looking for another product. I am done with this company 1st Quicken now this, no way to run a company. Is there any one out there that has a recommendation on another product."
1,"I work on friends and families computers regularly.  I have worked on computers running McAfee and Norton and when I run Avast on these computers, it always dects viruses that were not detected by other anti-virus companies.  This software also supports older operating systems that others don't.  And most importantly, I have not had any virus related issues with any computer I support since installing Avast on them.  No one I have ever recommended Avast to, has ever change to another anti-virus software after installing Avast."
1,I downloaded QuickBooks Premier from the website and was very pleased with the ease of the transaction. We are downgrading from QuickBooks Enterprise because our version was outdated and had some issues after my computer was attacked by a virus. QB Premier is easy to set up and use. It provides us with everything we need for our sales and accounting needs for our commercial flooring distribution business. This is the 3rd QB version I have used and I have loved each one. Very easy to use even for a non-accounting person.
1,"After reading the poor reviews about Turbo Tax I switched to H & R Block this year.  I agree with the others, it imports easily - automatically - from Turbo Tax.  Unfortunately, I had some complex issues regarding retirement fund distributions (retired in late 2013) and the program said I owed quite a bit and perhaps underpayment penalties.  Not wanting to give up so much money, I took it to H&R Block, my friend owned it prior to selling out for his own retirement and still helps during tax season, he saved me $1800, even with their fee. But, then, my tax issue is so rare in my area that he had never before run across it.  However, I also do taxes with it for other family members, much simpler ones than mine, and so far it works just as well as Turbo Tax for them."
0,"This is a scam product<br /><br />  Look below my everyone's name who has rated this as 1 star:<br />Verified Purchase (Amazon customers that have actually purchased the product)<br /><br />  Everyone who has rated this as a 5 star:<br />This review is from: Moneydance Personal Finance Manager (People who work for Moneydance and have artificially inflated the rating for this product)<br /><br />  Even after importing data from my Suntrust account - I cannot use a budget or run a budget report (compare January budget spending to February budget spending).  Setup for TD Ameritrade money market account - unsuccessful.  Setup for Mortgage account - unsuccessful.  I personal do not enjoy doing business with Intuit (Quickbooks and Quicken).  Since Microsoft Money was taken off the shelf there is no other real choice but to use Quicken.  I purchased Moneydance because of the 5 star reviews, did not read all of the 1 star reviews and wanted a new system after issues with Quicken not downloading on an old version.  READ ALL OF THE 1 STAR REVIEWS!!"
1,use this every year
0,"The system requirements were misleading.  My computer meet the stated system requirements for the software, yet it would run.  The system requirements were eventually revised, and I 'm out the money that I spent.  Boo..."
0,The federal return portion works fine.  Then  after you have entered all of the info the program tells you that to complete the state filing requires another $45.
0,"Wow...I'm glad I spent the time to read through many of these reviews.  I've been a user since 1997, growing increasingly annoyed with each year's release, and am now unwilling to continue using their product. From the backhanded methods of trying to push you to more expensive versions, to the continual focus on the rebate $$$ they are \\""helping\\"" you to find, culminating with this years' Schedule changes, leave me unable to trust them with my business or personal details.  Even their website appears to have fake reviews pumping non-descript high ratings.  Thankfully there are other options available...a.k.a. the competition.    *********  Update to review - I purchased H&R Block Deluxe on 12/23 and can immediately say I'm sold. Much more straightforward interface, no annoying plugs for upgrading, no \\""rebate mania\\"", better price/value. It imported all my prior TT data.  TTQuicken (Intuit) had better heed the backlash to their methods.  Switching to the competition was quite easy...and I held out for years, expecting them to take feedback seriously."
0,"Year by year turbo tax has become more and more expensive squezing every penny out of you they can, while not giving you any noticeable improvements for the money. Thanks for all the reviews everybody this makes my decision easy I'm switching this your to H&R Blocks software. You lost another once loyal customer TurboTax."
0,"Very annoyed with the CC platform being on the cloud with a monthly subscription.  I don't use the software enough to warrant this, but it doesn't mean I wouldn't like to have it available to me when I need it!  BOO HISS Adobe!"
1,"This came to me along with AVG as the most highly rated no-cost AntiVirus products available.  I tried both products and for what its worth, found this one to be the easiest to use, install, and operate.  The user Interface and product automation are excellent.  The production team's regular updates and improvements are quite good.  I have recommended this one to several friends and other users."
1,I do professional photography and videography for event's and selling merchandise. Does exactly what I need.
0,The Excel portion of this product is not working! I paid too much money for it and I am not happy about this at all. HELP!!!
0,"And for what. I have run into problems with Intuit upgrades, though those were forced by QuickenBillPay no longer supporting versions older than two years before. This was an act of pure hubris. I have spent hours with a Bill Pay specialist who can not get the program to stop dropping passwords in a random fashion, My bank makes me create an interim four character password, though that information is unveiled only after any failure. (Even I can author instructions.) This seems to abort the entire process.<br /><br />Just try to reset your password: special characters are fine on the web but NOT for software passwords. Was the programmer sleeping in that month.<br /><br />Intuit is not worthy of support. I will be trying to roll back and obtain a refund. No recompense, of course, for the wasted adrenalin."
1,"I've used a lot of different antivirus software. Avast is my favorite, not only because it is effective, but because of its frequent virus profile updates. It updates those profiles immediately, even if they have to do it more than once a day. No antivirus software can be 100% effective all the time for every one. But, Avast is as close to perfect as any rational geek can expect."
0,I have used TurboTax for the past 8 years.  The past 2 year I noticed is have been getting cheated out of my &#34;Free E-File&#34; for the State filing.  It asked if i was ready to use it and when i state yes I am it didn't show up as free.  This has happened the past 2 years like clockwork.  It has become frustrating but what can you do... Calling you hit a phone tree that goes in circles until you give up...
0,"Have been a quicken user for 20 years.  Usually upgrade very two years on the even numbered years.  Usually get a deal so it's around $40 or so to upgrade to the Premier version.  This time I upgraded at a cost of $104.00.  Every since upgrading I have had nothing but problems.  I could never get it to reconcile my Navy Federal Credit Union checking account, and now it won't even check into the NFCU account.  So VERY VERY dissappointing.  Have spent over 4 hours on the telephone with tech support and still do not have a working copy.  I just wish I knew how to go back to Quicken 2012.  I'd do it in a heartbeat and just throw away that $104.00 if I didn't think I would screw everything up"
0,"THIS PRODUCT REQUIRES YOU TO PAY $700+ EVERY YEAR FOR PAYROLL AND THEIR BUSINESS CARE PLAN. I was a previous customer with Peachtree/SAGE. I had used Peachtree for 20+ years. I did not upgrade to SAGE and I am not able to use many accounting features. Example: I can not process my customers credit cards as of Aug 1, 2014. The version I have from 2012 crashes continuesly while posting. I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,I've used this software for over 15 years and I think it works great.  Very easy and quick to use.  I usually buy the CD version but tried the download version this year.  It was difficult to download and had to do it three times to get it to correctly download/install.
1,Works as described
1,Fast and speedy delivery
0,It would be nice if it did an auto download of my entire computer and then auto add new things as they are saved on the computer.
1,"I've had this product for over 2 years and it's the best antivirus I've ever had!  Doesn't slow me down like AVG, McAfee, or Norton."
1,My 7 year old is using this program to learn to type.  She really enjoys it and is learning a lot.  I don't have to insist that she practice her typing skills - she wants to practice with this program.
1,All my home pc's and tablets have avast and my pc's are clean as far as avast is telling me!!!
1,"Great product, better yet, great price! I have always been an a secure advocate of Norton, but considered it more &#34;pricey&#34; than other security software."
0,"Anyone else notice how the recent 5 star reviews seem to be so similar? Two or three sentences about how &#34;this is a great and wonderful product to manage your personal finances.  I can't wait to learn all it's powerful features.&#34;  When you look at the authors' other reviews, a large number of the profiles have no other reviews other than the positive Quicken review.  Things that may you go &#34;hmmmmm.&#34;  It's really evident if you look at just the 5 star reviews sorted by newest first.  Pay up to Intuit so you can somewhat keep your financial files going, or start over with another product.  I don't see a lot of difference between what Intuit does as compared to hackers that encrypt a computer hard drive and demand money for the encryption key.  Is there anything out there that will import a quicken file so that I don't lose all the account history created while using Quicken for years?  I gave in at the end of April and &#34;upgraded&#34; to 2014 Home and Business because they cut me off from the account downloads.  Didn't put enough time in to doing research before hand or I'd have gone somewhere else.  There's got to be another alternative than just starting from scratch with a new product.  I say &#34;upgrade&#34; with the quotes because there appears to be nothing better in this version than in the previous version that was &#34;obsolete.&#34;  Sure, a couple things are different, but not really any better.  And things that worked before, now don't work in 2014.  My Wells Fargo and Bank of America account downloads that worked fine previously, don't work now.  I've been a Quicken user for a couple decades but this is going to be the last money they get from me.  What did I just pay money for?  To go backwards in service?  The only good thing I can say about it is that at least it installed correctly and it hasn't corrupted itself yet like so many people have reported.  My brother, another long time Quicken user is using 2012 but has said he'll lookat other stuff before he goes &#34;obsolete&#34; next year.  I've had it with Intuit.  I'm going to plan ahead and go through the pain of leaving them because the pain of staying has become more.  Turbo Tax has caused two errors in the past 4 years that required me to file amended returns and luckily I caught a third error one of the other two years.  (involved scholarship income that exceeded tuition and fees, TurboTax doubled it, and a childcare deduction that was given while participating in a childcare fsa)  On the business side of Intuit, their ViewMyPaycheck process with Quickbooks illustrates how out of touch their developers or product managers really are.  I'm not trying to dump on outsourcing overseas, but I'd put a good sized bet that their product teams are being led by people who don't actually live in the U.S or any other modern economy.  That or they're doing a lousy job because they don't seem to understand the actual flow of life of their customers.  (Yeah, I know first world problems, but that's the point of the product)  They recently created a new website for uploading paystubs for those using QuickBooks, which our payroll firm does.  To log in to the new website, you have to use your social security number and the net pay amount as the key to activate the account.  But, if you have direct deposit, your net amount is 0 and Intuit, for security reasons since 0 would be too easy to guess, won't accept that as a valid amount to activate the account.  So, the payroll person has to dummy up an entry to upload to the Intuit system so that a person can then activate the account.  It's a manual process that has to be done individually for each employee.  Way to think that process through, Intuit.  If I have a net amount, it means I'm getting a paper paycheck and already have my paystub, you dolts.  The month they rolled it out, the wait time to talk to a chat rep on the website was over 45 minutes.  Years ago I was with a  company that worked closely with Intuit.  It's sad to see the state their products are in now.  If you haven't bought Quicken previously, don't start.  Something out there has to be better.  Competitors, give an option to import data from Quicken files for account history and get the word out in the market and you'll have a wave of former Quicken users coming your way.  Just don't extort us with meaningless upgrades.  5-21-14 Looks like I spoke too soon and jinxed myself.  I've had two crashes in the past 24 hours, both with other functions in the program - one while trying to figure out what in the world they think the budget section is supposed to be now and another by simply clicking on the bills tab.  Seriously?  The first one I had to process manager out of and the other just shut the program down without any comment.  So, in summary, since I've upgraded in early May, I can no longer get all of my accounts to download, which they did in the previous version, and if I try to do anything else with the program other than just add transactions, it apparently crashes or freezes the program.  For all intents, I have paid for an on-computer checkbook register.  Wahoo.  5-22-14  Have had to almost give up on revising my budget.  After editing a few fields, the screen stops refreshing.  I think this is the repainting problem some others have mentioned. However, if I alt-tab to another program, no problem at all, so it's definitely just limited to Quicken.  When I try to close the program by X'ing out, I can hear the dialog box pop open asking whether I want to back up or do the mobile app install, but since it doesn't actually show on the screen, I can't click on it to make a selection.  Have to use the task manager to kill the process to shut the program down when it's like that.  8-17-2015  A year plus later and I'd probably give it maybe a star and a half now, but just barely.  And that extra half star is only because I can sort of get done what I want to do now, through various work-arounds.  Still have accounts that will connect via web-connect if I do the download just for that bank individually, but won't work at all if I try to do it as part of the auto-update process.   (Wells)  Have had to reset accounts about once a quarter for other banks.   (BofA, Chase)   The only improvement I can see is that in the planning section, where it used to do the memory screen refresh problem after about a minute, now it will actually work for about 10 to 15 minutes.  However, when it finally hits that refresh problem, now it not only fails to refresh the Quicken program, but it keeps most of my other programs from refreshing also.  I had to reboot the PC a couple of weeks ago because I couldn't even get the task manager to function properly and all when the Quicken planner screen stops working.    I think the best part of the whole experience (and not in a good &#34;best&#34; way) is that when I went to talk to tech support about it today because I'd really like to use the planning tools, I find out that I'm now going to get charged even if I want to chat with a rep somewhere in the Far East who is working from a script because my product is &#34;older.&#34;  If I want free tech support, I should upgrade.  Yeah, let's see, pay you more money to upgrade from a product that never worked like it was supposed to in the hopes that the next one will somehow break the long string of junk products you've been selling for the past many years?  Gee, thanks, not right now.     Does someone have a Quicken alternative they'd like to recommend?"
0,"I have used Quickbooks since early 2000.  It is very helpful.<br />The payroll service was appropriately priced for many years.<br />The payroll service is now a total ripoff.  If I could give it minus 10 stars I would.<br /><br />I would say I have been a pretty loyal customer having purchased multiple Quickbooks Pro and payroll subscriptions.<br />It used to be that you would get one free payroll update with every new Quickbooks version.<br />Then came the Enhanced payroll with the annual fee.<br /><br />NOW - not only does the CUSTOMER need to purchase the subscription at retail, the CUSTOMER needs to pay $2 per employee per month for the ability to have a subscription to the payroll updates/forms.  You can not even pay the yearly cost at one time.  It has to be charged to your credit/debit card every month.<br /><br />Here is their plan - how many employees being paid through Intuit/Qucikbooks payroll.......millions.<br />This is just another way to bleed the CUSTOMERS on a steady basis.<br />You take a great company and then bleed the loyal customers on a steady basis.  Sounds like a great case study for business undergrads.<br /><br />I have 2 employees.  This is just another wasted charge to my business.<br /><br />I will search for another option..."
1,It was relatively easy to use.  I did have some help from an accountant due to my concern for valid deductions.  But overall it was very good.  This is my second year with TurboTax.
1,"TurboTax shot itself in the foot for 2014 when they raised the price of its Basic product while eliminating 'basic' forms. I've used TurboTax forever! I will never go back. This H&R product was slicker and easier to use than TurboTax, came with all the basic forms including Schedule C, imported last year's TurboTax file, and offered free electronic filing for 5 Federal returns. I did not purchase the state version since my state has a very usable website. Due to all the bad publicity, TurboTax offered registered users a $25 rebate. Too little, too late since the software cost $75. Good going H&R Block for offering a superior product for under $20."
0,"About the only thing I gained by upgrading from Quicken Deluxe 2012 is the ability to have Q on my Android phone, which, it turns out, is not such a big selling point."
1,Simply a necessity in our world today.  Good price for exceptional protection.
1,"I downloaded the Norton Internet Security 2013 after having constant problems with the subscribed Avast! Internet program. I did research on several different programs before deciding on Norton. After several months of trying to resolve Avast! internet problems through phone tech support, I finally gave up on it, even though, I still have several months left on my subscription. I strongly recommend Norton. Stay away from Avast!!!!"
1,Always updating eliminates threats and best of all it's free. Why would you want to pay?
1,"I haven't ventured through all this program has to offer yet, but so far so good. I found it fairly easy to use the different editing tools and publish my videos, which is what I was looking for."
0,"Don't waste your money.<br /><br />We have a small business registered as a multimember LLC . My wife and I are the sole members. Too late to change from using TurboTax this year. Turns out you have to use TWO separate programs to file taxes????<br />One for the business and one for personal return. Way to rip people off. H&R Block would have given us both type of returns plus our kids returns for $89 list, vs the $220+ discounted it is costing us for this debacle. Adding insult to injury it wont even import from it's own sister product QuickBooks Online even though it lists importing QuickBooks on the box.<br /><br />The whole reason we are stuck and filing on the very last day is because QuickBooks Online changed during the year and it messed up the way you record sales tax paid to the state.. We had to delete and re-enter 3 years of sales tax paid data before we could get a proper P&L from that program.<br /><br />I'm ready to vote with my $$ and switch from QuickBooks online to another product and forget about ever buying this product again. Way to go Intuit.<br />If anyone starts a class action I'm in."

0,"Overall Quicken is a great product for tracking personal finance.  I have been using it consistently since 1997 and have found it to be a great product.  My reservation with this \\""New\\"" product comes mainly from the \\""Annual\\"" upgrade of $65/year.  Honestly, I do not see much benefit from the upgrades even though I have bought every one. Further the Budgeting part of the 2015 program is still VERY buggy.  Support from Quicken is also not as good as I would like.<br /><br />With all that being said - there is no other program on the market that competes with Quicken.  When there is, I will likely give it a try."
0,"The main selling point that pushed me to this version was the mobile app. Turns out only reconciled items show up on the mobile app. That means it's not really showing you what's on your desktop and depending on how frequent you enter items on your desktop, you could be as much as a month off. Pretty useless since you still have to rely on your desktop to get your actual balances."
0,"Horrible software.  Riddled with bugs.  Planned obsolescence forces users to upgrade.  Bug fixes often not released in current versions, but in a new paid version.  Support is worst I've ever dealt with from any company.  Intuit owns competition; no incentive for them to improve.  PLEASE STOP SUPPORTING THIS COMPANY!!!  Until Intuit gets their act together, do not buy their software!!!  This software is so riddled with bugs, terrible terrible support, end of life within a few months of the release window, crashes, etc.  Do not trust your important data with this software! I've used every version since 2008, and I'm finally done.  I keep thinking they'll improve at some point, but each version release just gets worse and worse, with more and more features removed.  If you're a basic user, you may not notice this stuff, but if you took the time to pay for Rental Property Management software, presumable you care about your data and want a reliable program backed by a honest company with a proven track record to do the right thing.  Intuit/Quicken is not that company."
1,"Does everything $79 a year did; although after I downloaded the free software I did buy their Internet Security (because it adds a firewall) for $19 (normally $49) .  So for $19, not $79 I'm getting the same protection & avast is very user friendly.<br />It takes awhile to go through all the various tools & features it has, but it's time well spent.  Have 'not' had to contact avast for anything; it all just works."
0,"My previous year taxes will not merge bc digital downloaded software is different from having the CD ! That was the 1st problem. & I have never had a problem with H&R Block DIY taxes! I don't know if its the software or H&R Block but my &#34;employer ID. & their name from the W2 section b.&#34;  does not match IRS files so my return is being rejected! (Last year it was accepted with the same job I'd) I didn't get much help from H&R Block except to call the IRS. If you can get a hold of the IRS hotline, website or web chat, their not helping either! What a nightmare"
0,It was not what I expected and it did meet my needs. I am sure it will benefit a lot of other people.
1,Did this in 2014 for our 13 year old daughter and she loved it.  Hid the notes in plastic easter eggs with some candy.
0,REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT.  WAS NOTHING WHAT IT USED TO BE.  WISH I NEVER BOUGHT?
0,bought it but never found the download link
0,I don't like trying to resolve blue pencil items. It makes no sense. It came as a total surprise having used this product for at least ten years.
0,"Don't buy the Windows 8 operating system.  It was made for tablet-type products and is a complete, utter disaster for laptop and desktop applications.  I am a long-time heavy user of Windows products and, ironically, believe Windows 7 one of the best operating systems anywhere.  Windows 8 is more than frustrating, it is infuriating.  And don't think you can buy a computer with Windows 8 then just have Windows 7 installed as several close friends say this doesn't always work.  Your best bet is to buy a computer with Windows 7 already installed or go to Apple."
1,my computer runs like brand new
1,"I'm a long time WordPerfect user since version 5.2. I love this program and this version. The program is user friendly, menus are where I'm accustomed to seeing them and the best feature of all is the &#34;reveal codes&#34;. Reveal codes helps me format documents in ways that no other word processing program can do! Plus I can place the cursor anywhere on the screen and that is where the text will start!<br /><br />So long as Corel produces a great product like WordPerfect, I will continue to buy their products."
0,"This program should have been tested before distribution.  Imports will double enter on some accounts and not others, despite the fact that they are both the same type and from the same bank.  One account imported, then was deleted when updated.  Don't waste your time or money."
0,I'm a little distraught over turbo taxes practices and how they have changed versions. Almost as if they're disrupting their own model.... it doesn't make sense.
0,Microsoft downloads at this point are radioactive. Their own website and this one will efficiently take your money and deliver NOTHING. Buyer beware!
1,"I do all my website development with this program. There is no live technical support and you have to figure it out yourself. Otherwise, a good program."
1,does the work as advertised!!! was looking for a software to convert videos from my phone and this does the job seamlessly.
0,"In the past years I had used the Deluxe edition. This year when I got to the point of using it for Form K-1, it told me that I could not use the Deluxe edition, and would have to get the Premium edition for a  additional $30. Turbo Tax had made changes that I was not aware off. So in order to complete my return I had to spend more money. I am not happy."
1,Great
1,Works perfect on my MacBook Pro running Yosemite
0,The software never downloaded and I had to buy a completely different one from the official website.  I tried to get a refund but amazon states this item is ineligible for returns.  If I had known I would NEVER have bought this.  I hate this.
1,I LOVE ONENOTE.<br />It has made me more organized at a minimum.<br />I would even go as far as to say it has improved the quality of my life. Now I am especially happy to have it on my android device.
0,"I should have read the fine print. My fault. I ended up spending $30 on this and 39.99 on the state e-version. Buying in store comes with one free state file, could have gotten it there for $49.99.<br />My loss, won't do that again."
1,"Well Worth the Price, Its a Good Product if you want to Learn 3D Studio mac Has some really good easy to understand videos. The Practice Exam could of been better,"
1,"Easy to use, and good technical support. I don't necessarily care for some of the add-ons, but overall a good product."
1,"I've used this program for almost 10 years and have been fully protected by it from day one.  Never so much as one virus infection.  I admit to trying others, but I've never found a program that works, as well and is as unobtrusive as Avast.  It sits in the background until it's needed, when it produces a clear danger warning...what more could you want from an antivirus?<br /><br />Did I mention I love the fact it does what it does so well at no cost?  Loving Avast!"
1,"I was very pleased with Turbo Tax Deluxe which I downloaded from Amazon.com.  I am a first-timeuser and will undoubtedly grow more accustomed to filing my taxes this way as time goes by -- I was a little afraid that I might &#34;lose&#34; some of my entries each time I closed TTD down, but that never happened!"
1,Great replacement for Quicken! Works really well and doesn't have all the bloat of Quicken or the constant requirement to pay for upgrades. Support is very helpful when needed. I use the Mac and iOS versions and they work perfectly together.
1,It was great and helpful. It made life easier.
1,I've always had norton for my antivirus protection. very straightforward no fuss no ad drama and very reliable pc protector.
0,"The Quicken product is a fine product after installation. It acceptably and, relatively easily, allows you to manage your personal finances. I have used it for many years. The disturbing part of it is that I was &#34;forced&#34; to buy Quicken 2013 and I was &#34;forced&#34; to buy Quicken 2010, and I was forced to buy Quicken 2007, etc., because it down-functions itself after three years. The ONLY reason the product makes itself easy to manage all your personal finances is that it can download individual transactions automatically from almost every financial institution where you might have activity (banks, investment firms, credit cards, etc.). However, after you use it three years, it warns you that you will LOSE that ability if you don't buy the new version. ... I don't know any other software product that is so rude. Typically, I buy new versions of software products, because they have added additional features I wish to use. Intuit just sits back on their hands, making nominal improvements each year, and force you to upgrade every three years to keep the functions you purchased originally!"
1,item works great add ons can slow u down a bit but over all satisfied with productand easy downlad services
1,This is a good product and I use it every year. I had problems with the download this year but the company fixed the problem right away.
1,This program has many tools that make creating a comic or manga much easier and faster than before. Although I first had problems with downloading all the files and getting the program up and running but in the end it was worth it. I'd recommend this to any beginner. It'll probably be easier to buy the disc then to download from the web might save you a few hours of headaches.
1,"I'm a senior and been using a PC for 15 yrs. but admit to being challenged with newer products/technology. The download was smooth but I did have had trouble with the activation. What I  finally ended up doing was removing the installation for my 2012 Norton 360, then proceeded with new product activation without problems. My fault? Possibly but was frustrating all the same."
0,I was upgrading from 2013 and was shocked and dismayed to learn Quicken 2015 will not function without an Internet connection (must create an Intuit account to even activate the product).  Looking for an alternative to Intuit Quicken.
0,"I found it difficult to use, especially the part designed to protect financial websites. it sends you to another place altogether to pay your bills.  It is difficult to figure out how to allow new programs that I want to add. And worst of all, it is deliberately designed to keep you once you sign up.  The customer service number is not free and they tell you up front to expect a 10 minute delay or more. Checking the \\""do not renew\\"" button does nothing and they send the renewal through the bank before the old subscription is up - at the full price I might add. It does nothing for spam (maybe it is not supposed to) Little messages pop up when you least expect them telling you that you have a virus. They sit there and blink in the corner of your screen. You have to manually deal with it on your own. Other ant-virus software at least quarantined them until I could check them. This program makes you stop right then to deal with them. I can find NOIHING that I like about this software."
1,Ver y good
0,it wont download and I cant get any help. so that's $20 I just gave them for nothing
1,Great price and was used well.  Protected my computer from multiple viruses.  It was easy to download and easy to connect.
0,"Doesnt work on my computer, y try to install several times"
0,Wrong address
1,"Works great, has about 95% of the features Microsoft has, but I dont care. Use this for school daily, and converts to word and back easily."
1,This is a rich product. Very complete. Also free!
0,User friendly but once the tax forms are complete TurboTax charges 40+ dollars to submit. WE SHOULD BE TOLD OF THESE HIDDEN CHARGES BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT! !!
1,I got tired of using Mint and decided to try Quicken for Mac and have been pleasantly surprised.  The programming is almost equal to the Windows version and far superior to Mint.
0,DO NOT.....REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE A DOWNLOAD VERSIONS OF THIS PROGRAM.....ITS CORRUPTED.....YOU CANT GET ANYONE TO HELP YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK...I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD A COPYOF THIS CORRUPTED CRAP!!!!!
0,"I haven't noticed any big improvements over the last release. Not sure why a new release was needed except to make more money. I have used Quicken for my personal finances for decades, literally, and I like it a lot, but I just don't understand the need for 2014."
1,"Awesome product and I have used it for years mostly with word processing software.  This new version has bells and whistles I don't really need, at least not yet, but I like knowing that it does more than take just screenshots.  It's a program that is easy to learn, flexible, and there are no snags with the installation - pun intended. Very pleased!"
1,"I had last updated in 2011. I love the updates on 2013 and the layout is easier to follow. Like any new software , it takes about 30 minutes to figure out where things are and retrain your brain but it is very easy to use."
0,"I am not a power user for quicken so just wanted the basic functionality from the software such as basic reports, able to update from bank and credit card companies directly instead of downloading qif file.  This was able to see only one of my credit cards, but several others were not available and these were major banking groups.  Not sure why on the windows version it can download from my bank and ALL credit cards but this version was not able to.  This software gives about as much functionality as using pencil and paper.  Will have to stick with Parallel's and Quicken for windows.  They should change their policy and allow returns for this product."
1,"it all the same. it just different prices at different sites; so, buy online and save. I do and so should you"
0,"Actually, I need a star halfway between &#34;I don't like it&#34; ans &#34;It's okay&#34;.  You can't transfer funds between accounts except by doing each as a separate entry.  Okay if you have no other choice and the price is right-- another fine example of you get what you pay for."
1,"I've used Turbo Tax for the past several years and have found it to be an excellent product, reasonably priced and easy to use.  I was able to do both my Federal and state returns in approximately two hours, have them e-filed and receive my Federal refund in exactly two weeks."
1,"We have used Turbo Tax Delux for eleven years (2004-2015) Each year it seems to get easier to do our own taxes as our situation has simplified as we have aged, and the software has improved over the years. We choose to E-file, but pay the remaining balance due via check and postal mail. That is a personal choice, not due to any issue with Turbo-Tax. One small detail needing improvement in the program though, both the Federal and our State require a voucher-form to accompany a payment check if your payment is not included in the E-file transmission. INTUIT needs to make it easier to print a copy (or 2) of that voucher for those of us who do the E-file then decide to pay by check rather than use a credit card or electronic transfer of funds.<br />  A Small correction would make Turbo-Tax a 5-Star Product for us."
1,I haven't as yet been able to download this software but will get a local computer service to help me on this.
1,Works great for my purposes. Does everything I need it to do.
0,Did not think that this version adequately explained problems and questions that arose because of the Unaffordable Care Act.  Also very difficult to print the returns.  Wound up having to go to an accountant.
0,"Sorry, couldn't get it to load on Windows 10 current preview. I saw somewhere that it was listed as compatible, but alas, is not, confirmed by tech support."
0,"A little disappointed because I thought this included everything.  It seemed like a great deal, but I had to pay extra for state taxes and electronic submission.  You win this time TurboTax!"
0,"I had Norton 360 v5 thru Comcast up til last year. Never had a problem. I since moved and no longer had Comcast which offered free Norton. So, I bought the new Norton 360 V6 here. After a few months I got a trojan from a file I downloaded on CNET. I ran a scan on the file before running the install. Now I have three trojans on my laptop. Norton continues to contain them ut they're still there. Their customer reps are the biggest dopes I've ever dealt with. Worse than Dell. The rep told me to download NBRT and burn it to CD, then restart and boot from there, which I did. Nothing happened. I went right back into windows. Then another dope rep insists since the issue is on this PC, I should download and burn it on other CD from another PC. For real? Are you kidding me?"
1,"I'd actually like to rate avast! AV between &#34;I like it&#34; and &#34;I love it&#34; (4.5 stars), because of the reminders about the features of the paid version that I don't get with the free version. But that would be petty, since the company is giving me free software. So, I'm giving the software two thumbs up.  It's easy to install and keep up to date (virus definitions and newer versions).  Once it's installed, it just works . . . no muss, no fuss.  So far, it's caught a couple of browser issues and couple more dangerous hombres."
0,This is really just a personal management software.  You can't really do any business bookkeeping on it.  It just links all your bank accounts together.  You would need quick book pro to do business bookkeeping.
1,"fast, quick, and reliable  I highly recommend to everybody.  easy to use and understand  easily automatically updated.  Works quietly in the background."
1,Love it!
1,"Not only is this software reasonably priced, it has the most user-friendly functionality of all the different software I have tried. Very easy to import a picture and create your own chart, customize it or build from scratch. I am having so much fun dreaming of new projects and designing patterns for my friends. It is like coloring for adults!<br /><br />The software developer is very quick to respond to questions or bugs you might find and once you purchase you get all the updates as well."
1,it performs nicely without constant pushes to upgrade to paid service.  I don't feel too much of a drain while it's running in background.  Solid 4 stars
0,Used this to successfully replace Quicken on the Mac (OS X 10.9.2).<br /><br />Seems to be stabile and reliable.<br /><br />But<br />1. Can't set a preference to not show the &#34;$&#34; sign<br />2. Can't set recurring transactions<br />3. Debit and Credit columns are the opposite of my checkbook and bank statement
1,"I have used the Turbotax so many years for my income tax, I just want to say I love it."
0,A problem with a form (8960 I believe) apparently would have forced me to redo my entire return after having already done it. I think I filled it out correctly. That's not why I bought tax software. No way to contact Intuit directly.
0,I bought this and I never recieved it. Because I had Norton on my computer in the past and some files were s=till in my computer I couldn't download this. What a waste
1,I have used this product for years and would not consider any other. It really is the best security software on the market!!
0,After downloading this product I kept getting notices that it was about to expire and that I needed to buy the real version of this product. I hate having to pay for anti-virus in the first place but that is besides the point.. If I would have known that this was only a trial product I would have not wasted my money!
0,POS Wells fargo now charges a monthly fee to access... program fights with the banks data
0,"It downloads, but when I hit the install using IE and google, I keep getting an error message, &#34;a fatal error has occured when parsing extracted packages, self-extract installer is corrupted. Error code: 2 (0x00000002) [The system cannot find the file specified].....very disappointed. I don't know what that means, but I will check out another one. Thanks anyways!"
0,"I've been in the computer trade since 1986.<br />THIS IS THE WORST VIRUS PROGRAM,,,,,,,,,,EVER!<br />As of today it is coming of of all my systems.<br />What a waste of time and money!~"
1,Download was easy. Installation was easy.  And best of all price was easy.  I puchased this product in March and have had no problems.  Thank you Amazon.
1,"I downloaded the free version of Avast and haven't had a single issue with vrirus', trojans and my computer seems to operate faster than before."
1,"IT takes a little bit of time getting used to the new menus and popups.  However, after working it for a while, things seem to make more sense in the layout.  The online backup/cloud availability helps tremendously"
1,I find it very easy to use and accurate.
1,"Best security software ever, and it's free!"
0,Not up to Turbotax of old
1,"Sense I'm only 11 year old I don't think it's much fun, my other games are way better. But my dad seems to like it just fine, I don't get the old generation they just don't know how to have fun."
0,"Unable to download due to a glitch on Amazon's side and they refused to refund my money, then when I asked for assistance, I was told that the customer service rep would stay on the phone with me until &#34;we&#34; reached a Microsoft rep and that he would assist me with the Microsoft rep...well the Amazon rep just dumped in a call cue in which I had to wait 30 minutes to speak to someone at Microsoft.... then after THREE HOURS (including hold times) with Microsoft and two more service reps later, the issue was still not resolved...have to wait for a call from yet another rep at Microsoft.  VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH AMAZON!!!"
0,"I agree with the other reviewers, the 2014 changes are nothing more than a money making scam. I have used turbotax for as long as I can remember. I purchased Deluxe every year and it met my tax needs very nicely. It is of no use to me now that they have removed the schedule C and D functionality.<br />I called the 800 number posted many times here by the turbotax vp. They simply told me I would need to purchase the premier version for $89.99. I am definitely switching to H&R Block software.<br />As one other reviewer stated, I'm sure there will be a lot of outraged customers who purchase the software not knowing about the change and get stuck in the middle of their return.<br />Bad move turbotax - Don't expect people to stick with you just because &#34;That's what they have always used.&#34;"
1,This product was 50 dollars on line as a download. I had no problem with the installation and its works perfect would recommend to anyone looking for this product. Don't waste your time buying the same product in the big box stores
1,Best price for an amazing product.  Download was easy and I was able to start using it immediately.  Amazon makes shopping a fun experience.  The site is easy to navigate and I always find what I am looking for.
0,"Beware, State is not included with this edition.  To add a state costs an additional $40.  It is cheaper to buy the Deluxe + State which can be purchased for $35."
1,"it does what it is supposed to do.  the order process was easy as usual, and the download, well easy too."
1,"I found that everything with the order was so very, very easy.  everything was just like described in the transaction"
0,It may be nice but I have no help using it<br />Can Simone call me to help me 3476508230<br />Please
1,Superb
1,My son downloaded it for me. He knows what he's doing. that's good enough for me. I've been happy with it so far!
1,This version of office works great on my Mac mini with the same learning curve experienced on my 2003 to 2010 conversion on the work Pc (every function is not located in the same place between versions).
1,Always very user friendly! Have had Quicken for years and everytime I upgrade I am very satisfied and happy with product.
1,"It does exactly as I hoped, very easy download.  Only thing is, and this is the issue that it's had for a while, is the program tends to slow down my processor with scans and updates.  Otherwise a good product."
1,"It does a great job of keeping my pc secure. It automatically updates itself. There are occasional pop-up ad, trying to sell you a premium version -- however, that is a small price to pay for a great FREE antivirus program."
1,Great as always.
1,"Nice graphical interface, does everything I needed to compose a short film of still photos with animation set to music."
0,Cant figure it out!<br /><br />I thought I'd buy a product of yours because I have really liked the free anit-virus I have been using and thought i'd spend some money with you in return.

1,"I would recommend Avast to anyone who wants really good anti spyware.  It catches everything from PUPs to viruses and Trojans before they can infect your system ,"
0,"19 April 2014 Update to review after a couple months of use.<br />The update from my bank (Wells Fargo) still doesn't work consistently.  Thinking that perhaps I'd made a mistake during the original installation I disabled my Wells Fargo account and deleted all my links and unfortunately my historical data.  I then re-enabled my connection to the bank.  I have 6 accounts with the bank and after re-enabling the connection, Quicken found four of these.  After another disable and enable Quicken found the remaining two accounts.  The next few times I used Quicken it found the accounts and updated them as it should.  Then the next time I used it after that, Quicken wouldn't update my primary checking account again. There was no error message.  By this time I'd become an old hand at forcing the download.  I disabled the forgotten primary checking account and re-enabled it and my data was updated.  Since then one or more of my accounts are not updated each time I connect to the bank.  The solution is always the same: disable the account and re-enable it and Quicken is correctly updated for that account.  Perhaps its unusual to have six accounts at the same bank, but Quicken should be able to handle it.<br /><br /> UNBELIEVABLE: My bank access worked five days.  Today I once more tried to download my financial information. The first thing that happened is I received a prompt to reenter my Intuit password. I did this under silent protest.  Then all of the downloads that had been working for the last week worked any more.  I had to disable and re enable all my accounts again. My checking account finally started working correctly.  My credit card account still doesn't work.  Down from two stars to one.<br /><br />I recently upgraded from Quicken 2014 from 2011, not because I saw any new features that I needed but because I kept receiving nags that the financial data download service for Quicken 2011 was expiring. I downloaded quicken, followed all the steps, and Quicken 2014 upgraded my 2011 file to the new format.  I opened and all my financial data was there as I'd hoped it would be. Then I went to to download my bank data.  The first thing I didn't like was that I couldn't continue with any download activity before I filled out a new form with name, address, e-mail address, etc. Why? I had been able to work just fine in Quicken for the last six years without ever having had to enter any of this data.  The information was obviously not necessary for me to work with my financial data. Yet there was no option to continue without entering this unnecessary information that was obviously of more advantage to Intuit than for me.  Arm twisted, I entered the information.<br /><br />When I attempted to download the data from my bank where I have several checking and savings accounts the my Quicken accounts were not updated.  There was no error message indicating why.  Like a fool I selected the download option a couple more times with the same result.  I went to the Intuit help page but found no acknowledgement that a problem like mine ever existed.<br /><br />Quicken had backed up my old 2011 file.  I went back to this file and imported into Quicken again from scratch. I filed out the form I disapproved of.  Then went on to download a file from another financial institution.  This actually worked. Then back to the bank.  This time I began receiving prompts asking if I had deleted my checking account recently, or had renamed it.  No and no.  Had I been having this problem over the last few days?  Well, it was a new version of Quicken, so not really, but if I admitted to that the program booted me out and told me to try in a few days.  So I finally said yes.  The program then said they would reset my accounts. This sounded chancy, but what was there to loose at this point?  The program whirred a bit then went through my accounts.  Some it identified correctly.  Others it mixed up, say a checking account it identified as a savings account.  Sometimes the correct selection would appear in the alternate list, sometimes not.  Finally it seemed to be finished.  I looked at my data and the latest account information still hadn't been downloaded.  Still no error message.  I went in an manually initiated the reset steps for the offending accounts.  Tried the download again.  The download failed again, but this time I received an error message.  It suggested I manually disable the accounts and then re-enable them.  Why I did not receive this error message in the first place, I don't know.  I followed the suggestion and disabled the offending accounts then re-enabled them and entered my account information again.  Yea, half the offending accounts now worked.  I disabled the remaining offending accounts a second time, enabled and entered the account information again and finally almost all the accounts worked.  There is one checking account which after two weeks the program still doesn't recognize.  But never mind, that account doesn't change very often.  This whole process wasted several hours of my time. Today, I initiated another download and a checking account that had been working up to this point didn't work again.  Good by to a few hours more.<br /><br />I'm a programmer myself and I assume the team that worked on the 2014 product had access to the 2011 code and data file structure information.  Why a simple import would bring a simple download function to its knees, and why all that functionality wasn't thoroughly tested, I find it difficult to fathom. Pretty shoddy workmanship.  Too bad there isn't some competing product out there. I used MS money before I had to switch to Quicken and even after all these years I recall it as a better product."
1,I am a Quickbooks fan despite little snafus every once in a while.  Their support people are very patient and helpful.  Thank you!
1,Even though I am new to the recording software world the music creator 6 is great tool to work with
1,Left Turbo Tax after over 12 years of use because of the recent changes they made to the &#34;Deluxe&#34; software. (Bunch of thieves) After using the H&R Block software I'll never go back. Thank you H&R Block. H&R Block software imports old Turbo tax files easily.
0,I bought this to make my life easier but instead I am more frustrated and have not been able to use it at all.  I am sure it is a great program but definitely need computer skills to figure out how to work it.  Pretty complicated.
1,"avast! Free Antivirus gives great protection. It checks both computer and online viruses and keeps your computer from downloading malicious software. The antivirus updates daily (or more) to keep your computer protected. Updates are seamless, quick, and do not disturb you while working on your computer. You can run manual checks whenever you feel you may have something creating a problem on your computer, such as a virus or spyware.<br /><br />It could be a little easier to figure out how to extract or delete viruses once they are found. This is still something that I need to figure how to do. I am used to the quarantine or deletion of viruses once they are found.<br /><br />I would not use another antivirus, rather free or paid for, because I really like the protection I get from avast! Free Antivirus. I have used it for a few years and it has kept my computer safe."
1,It's been very helpful. But this is for one year only. You'll have to buy again in coming years in case of need.
1,could not beat the price anywhere else. using this makes filing very easy.  I will use this again next year.
1,"This application is very workable.  It follows Quicken, a program hard to beat.  But Quicken seems to have made the decision that it is so good that no change or tweaking is needed for Mac programs, despite the fact they (Macs) have changed many times since 2006.  I never had the confidence to link directly with bank balances with Quicken, particularly where recent Mac upgrades seemed to cause some quirkiness.  There is a small learning curve to get up to speed with iBank.  If you are as disorganized as I, you may find yourself doing balances several months old.  iBank manages this easily but you must pay attention to where the highlighted line went when you hit return.  It won't be at the bottom of the page, as with Quicken.  It will be snuggled in with the old date range.  I like it.  It is great for Mac users."
1,Love this software. I wanted to be an architect after high school but I decided against it. This brings me back to drafting class in high school.
0,will not convert videos that are protected...I just wanted to use it to create my own personal video from one bought from iTunes.
0,Awful product!    I wish I could put no stars next to this product.    Do not download this piece of free junk it will completely mess up your computer. Don't believe the hype for all of the 5 stars. It is better to buy an affordable priced protection software instead. You will regret it once you download this piece of s***.
1,Can't live without it.
1,At first there were problems but they turned out to be something between Quicken and Bank of America and not my particular download.  I was able to get quick online tech support to work out the problems
1,Easy to use. Easy to understand. Well laid out and organized. Gave me the option to select or ignore possible tax issues.
0,"As a long time customer addicted to the fact the program already knew me so I kept buying it, this year was the last straw.  First I wasted hours entering all my trades as H&R hasn't figured out how to either let me import them from a text file, excel or download them from my broker.  Then when I got to the end, ready to submit, I do so and guess what, the program crashes and won't submit my return.  Worst possible time to find that out.  I wasted hours talking to their customer service and all they could do is reinstall the program and guess what, same result.  I even tried it on a different computer with a different operating system.  Same result.  Eventually I gave up and bought turbo tax, and not only did they save me hours by letting me download my trades from my broker through a text file, but it submitted the first time with no problems.  Never go with H&R they don't have a clue."
1,I tried to purchase this download from another vendor but took forever.  I needed it right away and this download was available immediately!
0,"Rosetta stone is pretty terrible.  I've tried three versions of it, German, Korean and Japanese.  I studied Japanese in college and lived there for a year, so the only reason I used Japanese Rosetta Stone was to compare it to the other two.  All they have done is cut and paste the scenarios from European (probably romance) languages and applied the same scenarios to Japanese.  While the concept of teaching you Japanese without translating it through English first is a good concept, the execution is horrendous.  It basically boils down to every scenario being a 4 question, multiple choice test.  With Korean, reading was very hard, because I had not yet learned Hangul.  Despite this, finding the right answer with Rosetta Stone wasn't that hard because you have a 25% chance (sometimes 33%) of getting it right.  In addition to this, they teach you stupid phrases that will not help you one bit in Japan.  Another annoying thing is what Rosetta Stone reads as correct pronunciation.  If you say things in Japanese the way people in Japan do.  An example would be a phrase like わたしはこれを食べる。(watashi wa kore wo taberu) people in Japan would say it more like ore/boku/atash kore taberu, kind of blending the wa and wo particle and using a more colloquial version of I.  If you pronounce these things like a native speaker would, it will say you pronounced in wrong.  This would be equivalent to being read wrong for not actually pronouncing &#34;ing&#34; despite the fact most Americans do not do this (i.e. where are you going vs. where ya goin').  You'll also actually learn phrases that most Japanese people don't use, and they won't understand what you're saying.  It'd be the equivalent to teaching English by still using &#34;thou&#34; and &#34;wilst&#34;, it'd just sound so weird.  My recommendation: Pimsleur, books, 読売新聞, anki droid.  If you're trying to learn Japanese using only this, you'll never really learn anything."
1,The problem is easy to use for anyone who has no or limited tax knowledge. I'll give this program 8 out of 10.
0,"... my wife needed it for PhD studies. I urged her to use OpenOffice or reconfigured one for Mac (NeoOffice), but she insists she'd rather think about the &#34;work&#34; than transforming OO files to Word files required by the Educational Borg.<br /><br />I said, &#34;It ain't no big thing. I'll help.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;But,&#34; she said, &#34;the Borg requires I have Word.&#34;<br /><br />And so we bought Word.<br /><br />At least she decided to give her relatively new PC laptop to a friend's kid who needed it for college, and then buy herself a MacBook Pro."
1,Great product!
0,It did not down properly to my computer system it was not compatible and therefore was returned. Thanks.
1,don't have any problems so far...great price too!
1,"the program is awesome. it is exactly what we have needed for a long time! the only thing that would be super is if it came with a teaching video so that I could learn to use it the correct way. It does so much more than I am capable of knowing how to do.. If I was an accountant, and had taken courses in computerized accounting, it would be perfect.. So, I wish Intuit would create a teaching video that could be purchased so that the user( me ) would get full use out of the property  management program.<br /><br />I am using it to it's fullest potential,, because it is way smarter than I am."
0,"Just finished my taxes using this. I would not recommend it. It's over priced, and if you're in California, you can electronically file for free, but Turbox tax will force you to pay $25($40 if they pull from your refund) for that option."
0,It's ok for the price but nothing too great.
1,"Saved me tons of money! I was about to purchase another popular software that merges and edits PDF's but thought I'd give this a try.... and save $300. This is exactly what I needed for my business - I'm happy, my clients are happy, and my wallet thanks me."
1,Use this every year for about ten years.  I would give it ten stars if I could!
1,"I needed to get my taxes done quickly since I filed an extension.  This version was available online through Amazon.  Downloaded it, and had my federal and state tax returns completed in an hour. So worth the price.  Cheaper than going to HRB on my own."
0,"I used the turbo tax for the last few years, but because I have to file a couple of K-1s every year, the program was costing me around 100 bucks. So this year, for the APPARENT cost of $19.99 I decided to give it a shot.  And its ok. The interface isn't quite as fluid or easy to use as turbo, but it has much less ads (there's a couple and they're nowhere near as annoying as turbotax's). The navigation from one part of the return to the other isn't the best, but it's doable.<br /><br />Biut here's what grinds my gears. For my state efile and to pay my taxes federally another $27 in charges. $8 more than the program cost for what I guess are considered &#34;add on&#34; items.  But really folks, in 2015 we have to pay a 3% fee to pay our taxes online??? And 20 bucks to file our state taxes some other way than mail?  I know it's not H&R's fault, or that of they're program, they're being opportunistic just like the rest of the tax prep market.  How does the IRS not take credit card payments directly. I know when I had some tax issues a decade back they had no problem &#34;electronically liberating&#34; my loot from my bank accounts.  And why do low income filers get to file state and federal for free? What's the difference to the IRS and State Tax Board?<br /><br />That had nothing to do with anything, but I had to say something."
0,"There is no cd that comes with it... although I already have the code, there is no instruction nor link on how to download it. When I went online chatted with them, they just gave me a telephone number to call. I'll deal it some other time. It seems that this is more inconvenience than anything else."
0,"After being forced to abandon Microsoft Money by several financial institutions, I've made the switch to Quicken.  NOT user friendly, signs me up for things from my bank that cost money, cannot transfer Money information into Quicken, so now I have several years of financial data that cannot be accessed without opening another program, after using for several months I finally found a way, I think, to stop automatically clearing transactions...    Not a happy Quicken user."
1,I'm really happy with the 2013 version of Quicken Home & Business. I was running 2010 so I love the upgrade.
0,"I have used Quicken for many years but the latest downgrade is a waste of money, at least for me.  I download my investments and bank accounts every day and it now takes 3 times as long to do that as it did with my 2011 version of Quicken.  There is nothing else new or useful to me in this version.  Thanks Quicken for another great downgrade."
1,This is a great product to work with. So many things you can do to challenge your creativity. I do recommend it!
1,Bought it for an online course requirement. So good. So much better than PSP. I use it everyday. It was an expensive purchase but well worth it.
1,"Excellent antivirus and service, fast shipping. Recommended for all, 100 percent. Thanks for the attention for the customer service. Thanks for your time."
0,"This one star is not based off of the product because the product is actually nice and quite easy to use.<br /><br />This is a review to let other potential buyers know what the hidden fees are when buying this.<br /><br />So I have been using Turbo tax for the past couple of years now.  I had always just used the product straight from Intuit's website.  The website is somewhat clear on the fees (it is sketchy because you really only know how much you need to pay once you fill all your tax information out and by then, you're going to be too lazy to dispute the additional $60+ fees).<br /><br />Sure, the Intuit website is sketch. So that was why I came to Amazon to see if I could get some more transparency on how much I would be paying.  I saw that it was $49.99 for the Federal and State preparation with free federal e-filing.  I figured \\""Great! it would be $49.99 + the cost for state e-filing.\\"" But that wasn't the complete costs.  Turbotax wanted to charge me $39.99 more for the \\""Turbotax Plus\\""!<br /><br />So I looked into what this \\""Turbotax Plus\\"" was and I found out that it is the audit defense. The program enrolled me in the audit defense program even through I clearly opted out of it.  This is heckaaaaa shaadyyyy.  I had to search through the Intuit forum to figure out what this was and other users had the same issue.  There is a \\""workaround\\"" that requires you to go through specific steps to remove this charge (apparently, this happens to the CA state filings).<br /><br />So beware and check what you are being charged for."
1,Good Software
0,Installs itself without consent through third party  programs and then puts viruses on your computer instead of protecting against them so that you pay more for the other packages
1,"I have used Quicken 2003 for the last ten years and found it very helpful.  I count on it to help me prepare my tax forms each year.  I decided this year it was time to upgrade.  Because my version was so old the upgrade was a little time consuming, but the instructions and the software made it easy.  I will not use many of the \\""bells and whistles, but I look forward to using the software for several years.[[ASIN:B00E6LJ2SA Quicken Deluxe 2014]]"
1,GREAT AS ALWAYS!!
1,"Have been a Quicken user since 1997; over time it has gotten to be a very useful financial management tool.  With the addition of Android App, free credit reports and enhanced investment tools, it is clearly the best in the category -- bar none.  Would be nice, however, to have the updates faster."
1,"Worked beautifully as expected.  Beware of default setting to scan in table blocks, and change to scan whole area. Your result will be much more editable and - in my case - accurate.  Speaking of accuracy, a great improvement over previous versions (I had 16.)"
0,"Back in the day I used to love Norton Utilities.  It has been about 10 years since I tried it and I was thinking that my startup was getting slow, so I decided to buy it. I found out that it didn't really help any with my startup and it was a pain in that it would delete all of my internet settings everyday.  This had some weird impacts such as my shopping sites losing my information, my browser losing my basic settings, being constantly asked if I would like the site to remember my settings, etc.  Anyway, I could extend the time between &#34;cleanings&#34;  but this was the only thing besides defragging the hard drive that I could discern that the program did.  It isn't worth the trouble."
0,"I am not sure I would purchase this PFM software.  Have been using Quicken for years.  Wanted to get off of Windows since Quicken was the only reason for having Windows and have been on a MAC for over 5 years.  Checked the internet and iBank was rated as Number 1 for PFM on a MAC so decided to load the trial.  Now at the end of the trial and still have many issues with the software.  I have seen the review where the person indicates that people are not giving the software a fair shake.  I have spent over 10 hours trying to get my accounts to balance and have spent several hours on Chat sessions with the technical support people.  They have little to no answers for why some of the issues I am having exist.  The last one this morning was wait for it to happen again and hopefully we can get something in the download log.  Not a good answer when I am at the end of the trial.  I even asked for an extension of the trial and was told no.  However I can get a 90 day money back approach if I buy from their web store.  Who wants to give them money and beg to get it back when they can not solve the problems.<br />First, I had to create three files to finally get the conversion from Quicken to iBank close to working.  iBank only uses Yahoo to download stock quotes.  However Yahoo is useless for anyone that may own Bonds in their portfolio since Yahoo does not recognize Bonds.  Big weakness in the software.<br />Second, the only way to get the Net Worth right is to manually input the prices for the bonds.  Not a good approach either.<br />Third, the software does not link with as many banks for direct connect as Quicken.  Unless you want to pay IGG a monthly fee then the information  has to be downloaded manually.  Again, more work than necessary.  Why would IGG not provide this information for free like quicken.  Guess they thing people will just buy the service.  Go to Quicken and get more for free.  This is not to say that Quicken will download all companies but more than IGGfor free.  This is an area that is getting to be more difficult with all the security sites are applying anyway.<br />Finally, support is not that great in solving problems.  In the many many years I have owned Quicken products, I have not had any reason to contact their support.  IGG at least 4 times in 30 days - not great."
1,Great tool to keep track of spending and looking forward at your money needs.
0,"I used to love this software, but what happened to me this year has turned me into a Turbotax customer. For whatever reason, this software is not fully &#34;Obamacare ready&#34;. I'm a self-employed consultant, and I signed up for Obamacare last year. Like many, I receive a subsidy. Well, this is apparently a situation that the 2014 version of H&R Block Tax software can't handle. When I got to the portion of the interview process that deals with healthcare, the software prompted me with a &#34;you need to visit a local office&#34; message. I did an online chat with a tax representative, and she told me the software was not capable of handling my situation. Ridiculous. It's not like the ACA just came out! So now I am forced to go through the steps of getting a refund for the product, and I had to quickly buy Turbotax (which thankfully IS ready to handle my &#34;unique&#34; situation)."
1,Exactly what I expected as usual. Did what I needed it to do. No complaints except for H&R Block's customer service help.
0,Amazon's big bonus. See it here http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001914211<br />You get $8 off Norton which they try to pawn off on everyone who buys a PC. Never wanted it before. Don't want it now. Thanks a lot.
0,"I ordered this and had it downloaded to my computer, i immediately received a notation that finances and banking were not well covered, so I upgraded to the security suite. As soon as I activiated the software, my keyboard didn't work (driver problem) nor did Google Chrome. i tried deleting Avast from my laptop, wouldn't delete. $39.95 and 90 minutes later the laptop customer service tech had the laptop working and the Avast off the computer. He suggested malicious third party software entered during one of the downloads. I called Avast, refused to help me and said I had to submit a form on their website. Submitted the form, and naturally no response, no refund. I cannot check on the form I submitted because i have no user name, no password. Are you willing to take this risk to your laptop/computer and spend over $62 to resolve a bad download? I gave one star because i could not give less. I'm happy my laptop is working again, but i have never, ever seen such horrible customer service as i have with Avast."
1,"Has not allowed any virus's in yet, I find it freindly with other programs too. Would recommend it. Good work Avast."
1,Will be ordering another soon
0,"It's hard to switch out of data entry mode and look at forms or go between forms.  Turbo tax just wants it done there way.  Also, there should be an auto mode for switching between married jointly and married separately."
1,I wanted to have a means to look at my accounts and bills in one place and to be able to do reports on specific items.  This software fits the bill.
0,"This company has the worst customer service staff on the planet, and they all speak English.  Call centers in Colorado and New York but you may as we'll be talking to a Martian.  The program is fine but don't expect to receive a straight answer about any question above and beyond a lost password.  Do not take the bonus offer!  My refund was sent to INTUIT 14 days ago and I have not received my bonus code despite 7 customer service claims.  I am in the process of filing a small claims suit to get my funds back.  Don't waste your time with this company."
1,"Downloaded on desktop and could not get it to work.  Found Symantec customer service online and had tech take over my computer and fix it.  Took a while to do, about 45 minutes, but now have working program.  Downloaded it on my laptop with no problems but you need to keep Product Key easily accessible. In my opinion worth the huge markdown from stores to use this downloadable anti-virus.  I saved more than 35$ from anything I was able to find locally (Texas).<br />As for capabilities it has stopped more than ten active attacks by viruses, rookits, etc. I don't do cloud saving so have no opinion about that.  I would recommend to friends for price, customer service and ease of use."
0,"TurboTax Deluxe for 2013 appears to discise some back end pricing and restrictions for the &#34;Refund Bonus Offer&#34;, until after you finish your taxes.  Federal is able to file free, and if you are due a refund, you can Either apply it all to the Amazon bonus offer, or Direct Deposit and purchase bonds, but not both.  One of the restrictions is you can not split your return to get the gift card at a 10% premium.<br /><br />Additionally the costs for posting your state taxes is not clear until you are ready to file.  The rates appear to have gone up this year to file state electronically.  Perhaps it's by state, but PA is now $44.99.<br /><br />Be cautious if you are a last minute filer.  And next year, Try to file earlier and consider your options.  I'm going to try Tax Act instead, for the first time in many years of using TurboTax."
1,Very handy program for creating .doc documents.  Helped me with preparing my book for publication.
0,Had to reformat computer because of a virus. Needed to reactivate Grimefighter. Called Avast. Got transferred to Iyogi. They wanted to do all kinds of work on my computer for money. Never got it reactivated. Clicked on links to use my license and it wouldn't work. Needless to say I cancelled auto renewal.
1,I've been using avast for about 10 years and love it.  I've never once had a problem with viruses.  I tried AVG briefly at the recommendation of a friend and it was a nightmare comparatively.  Seriously best antivirus on the market.
0,Beware!! Will not import your data from older versions of quicken. I made the move from 2007 Quicken to this one simply because Quicken forces you to to keep using the online services. To my amazement during install I was told this version cannot import data files from other versions of Quicken forcing you to have to start all over. What a ripoff. I hate that there is not another product out there that can compete and at least keep Intuit honest.
0,Doesn't do much. But what do you expect for free?
0,"This is easily the worst upgrade ever.  I had previously used Quicked Home and Business 2011 and had everything working without any major issues.  Transactions were recognized and categorized properly and downloads went (for the most part) without any hickups.  After the upgrade to Quicked 2014, almost every download skips transactions.  On top of that, those that actually make into the system are constantly miscategorized (despite the fact that I keep correcting them over and over).<br /><br />In addition to all of the problems with transactions, more often than not, if I want to run Quicken I have to start it, wait a while, go to Task Manager, shut down the entire process tree and then start the app again.<br /><br />To put it simply, this is the last version of Quicked that I am ever going to buy.  Unfortunately, I already sunk the money into this piece of crap.  I'm seriously going to look for alternatives and switch as soon as practically possible.  Intuit just lost another customer."
0,"The graphics are spectacular.  It's a great product if you want to generate 3D images to help visualize different interior and exterior decorating schemes on a generic box, but the company offers less expensive programs to do that.  I suspect those programs are bundled as component parts of this more comprehensive product so they probably do that kind of stuff well and for less money.  At this price level, the product is touted as an easy to use tool for someone attempting to design a house.  It simply isn't.  The main problem is that the program \\""auto-generates\\"" all roof planes.  It does not allow the user to edit those planes in any intuitive way.  The company offers on-line manuals, on line training videos and access to a users' forum but I haven't found it to be very helpful.  I could have completed several collegiate level technical drawing courses in less time and with less effort than I've invested trying to master this program and I've yet to make it work.  I have devised ways around the program's limitations but employing them requires a greater investment of time and effort than is spent on structural design which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of computer \\""aided\\"" drawing.  I wouldn't recommend this product.  It is frustrating.  The foregoing review, edited to remove some of the harsher comments, prompted the publisher to both post a response and write me directly.  Both responses offered assistance.  I've taken them up on it.  On the plus side, I received a sketch this evening that closely resembles the multilevel roof I spent an entire weekend attempting to achieve.  I've edited this review to boost the rating from one star to three because of the company's effort.  Chief Architect obviously wants satisfied customers and they have made a genuine and genuinely appreciated effort to satisfy me.  In the process, they've demonstrated that the program is more capable than my experience led me to believe.  On the other hand, the publisher's technical support staff has been evolving the \\""almost but not quite right\\"" drawing over a period of three days that involved exchanging plan files, pencil drawings and descriptive comments.  The comments informed me of various requirements that are not well explained in the manual.  Relatively simple roof lines auto generate acceptably but complex and multi-level roofs are not easy to produce.  The process is not intuitive and the learning curve is steep.  I still don't recommend the program for people who are inexperienced with computer aided design software."
0,"so far I can not get this program to kick it,my money was wasted, I am not a computer shiz so it is probably my fault, may work fine for otheers"
0,"Not good, it didn't work for my computer. I keep getting a message that says that is not compatible. No no"
1,"Below is my original review.  Within a day of my posting the negative review, I received an email from Intuit's customer support indicating that my complaints were indeed \\""fixed\\"" and that I could either run a patch or re-download and most of my issues would be solved.  Well I re-downloaded and all of my issues were indeed resolved.  The programs works flawlessly so far, but I cannot give it a 5 star rating until I am sure there are no hidden issues and that some of the issues I had with Q2012 I see are resolved.  The cloud issues I had are resolved.  The population of tax categories are solved.  With R2 all looks good so far BUT, I have my fingers crossed.<br /><br />In any case, kudos to Intuit for acting so quickly to the flaws in the program.  I have never seen such quick remedy to the enduser by a company as large as Intuit as I witnessed here.  Excellent lesson for others like Adobe, Microsoft, etc.<br /><br />I hope to be able to give the product 5 stars once I see that certain tax categorization issues I experienced in Q2012 are resolved in this release.<br /><br />I never learn my lesson.  I see these new releases and buy them immediately.<br /><br />While this release sounds like it is adding features of use, in reality, right now they don't work.  The Quicken cloud is DOA.  The spinning wheel just keeps spinning and spinning while trying to update the cloud and of course doesn't or can't at this time add your accounts to the cloud.<br /><br />When updating my accounts, I get a message that R2 is available, hoping, there is already a new version to fix problems with this new version.  Clicking on the upgrade, leads to a message that the upgrade is not applicable to your version of Quicken.  Of course I continually get the do you want to apply the upgrade message again and must assume there is indeed an R2 ready or almost ready for release.<br /><br />The account actions button has no been replaced by a tiny button at the top right of the screen which is a minor annoyance but I can live with it.<br /><br />The Tax Center does not work.  It does not populate your data in the respective fields, a real bummer if you pay use Quicken to estimate your taxes in real time like I do.<br /><br />The good news is that by around R3-4, the major bugs are usually worked out in any Quicken release, but it is really getting old to see every new Quicken have so many major bugs and those of us early adopters being used as guinea pigs, despite their supposedly large beta testing."
1,Bought this product to protect my computer.  It was nice to just download and it was pretty easy.  Price was great also.
1,"As usual turbo tax was easy to use, accurate, and fast.  Will continue to use it like I always do.  This was a good price"
1,The product worked great as always.  However I was disappointed when I found out I needed to pay $29.95 to get my refund deposited into my checking account.  In the past there was no charge and this fee really sounds excessive.  My choice was to take a prepaid credit card (which I did not want) or have a check sent to me which would have taken several more weeks.  Not sure when they started charging the $29.95 as I don't recall ever having to pay to have the check deposited into my checking account.
0,"Even though it does the same job as TurboTax, it isn't as user friendly as TurboTax. I guess you get what you paid for."
1,"In spite of the bad reviews, I went ahead and downloaded QB Pro 2015.  My accountant was starting to have difficulty converting my 2008 files.  The download, install, and conversion of two companies (one for my personal information) went flawlessly,  Maybe 2015's original releases needed more QA, but I want to state for the record that R5 seems to have gotten it right.  Go ahead and download without fear!<br /><br />I like the new look and features.<br /><br />My only gripe was figuring out how to turn off all those &#34;What's New&#34; popups.  (Edit &#62; Preferences &#62; General &#62; Turn off popup messages for products and services.)"
1,"A great product, I wouldn't want to do my taxes without it. There were no problems with the Amazon download option"
1,Intuit has been a very efficient and economical solution for handling my payroll.  They calculate all my taxes and pay them on line from my bank account.  A wonderful and inexpensive solution to a complicated process!
1,great.
0,"Totally useless service!<br /><br /> I tried to upload 75 GB of files and I received over 3,600 errors. I chose several different groups of failed files and some went up while others did not. I tried again and again and again numerous times and a few more went up leaving many other that didn't. After numerous attempts eventually there where hundreds of files that just will not go up. This service is useless when it is not possible to fully use it  for its intended purpose. That being a safe place to store my files.<br /><br />I have over 20 TB that I wanted to put up there for a safe keeping backup. I spent hours just trying to get 75 GB up and still could not get them all to go. At that rate it would take me years to get my files up and still would not have them all available from the cloud."

1,Stable and reliable anti-virus program. Have been using this on 2 computers and a tablet for years and am very comfortable that it is protecting my files.
0,"I had the taxes done and the software said it was ready to send, but when I attempted to send them they would not go through. Their website also indicated that it would.

0,It was decent for school when I wanted to write and record notes. I don't think it was worth the price though because it's a bit tedious to transfer the notes  due to the format.
1,No problems with software or download.  Have used same product before. great product
0,"The program worked ok, but did not really protect me from internet viruses or intrusions. It kept telling me it was not protecting me and wanted me to upgrade the program at ridiculously high prices. Save sometime and just buy a decent loaded antivirus program."
0,It serves well on my computer to protect it.
1,"There are many AV products to choose from, but I believe NAV strikes a decent balance and sufficient protection without hogging resources (RAM/CPU) like some of the others.  Pair this with Malwarebytes and you are sufficiently protected."
1,Every computer I've  ever owned came with Norton and It's a name I've came to trust.<br />So when I bought my new Lenovo and it came with McAfee I tied it for the 30 day trial period and it didn't come any where near the protection of Norton. So 2 days before the end of the trial period was over I searched the net for the cheapest price for Norton 2013 and got really lucky. Just happen that Amazon had it for less than $12 !!!!  What a bargain !!! Everywhere and I do mean everywhere  wanted $30 to $50 for it.  I almost bought at Walmart days before for a whopping $39.99.  I couldn't believe it would be that much with it being almost mid-year.  But as I said I got a great deal on what I consider an  &#34;A+&#34; product.
1,Exactly what I expected and easy to download for immediate use.  I've used QB off and on since the mid 90's so I'm familiar with setting up accounts and using right away.  it helps to have some computer skills and knowledge of how one transaction can effect the other if not careful.  Overall pleased with the product and so many accountants are using it that make audits easier.
0,"I upgraded from an earlier version to continue to have download support. I would have been far better off if Quicken simply charged to maintain download support. The 2013 version is extremely slow - it takes 3-5 seconds to process the entry of a transaction, which is unbelievably annoying. It also has many annoying changes that don't even make sense - for example, you can no longer exclude an account from the Net Worth Totals in Quicken. That has been a convenient feature for more than a decade; why is that changed?"
0,"It is just ok.  I have used older versions with much more ease.  But this one has worked for my needs so far.  I miss the older versions they didn't have any advertisements along the edges (much like Facebook) that I have to avoid.  I did check one out, but I don't need those kinds of graphics.  But there are a lot of graphics available - I just miss the easy front page that let you choose a card - then the size you needed - so on & so forth.  Now I have to really hunt for what I'm looking for to make."
1,love turbo tax.  very convenient
0,I am completely dissatisfied with this product.  I use Intuit payroll service in coordination with Quicken and the payroll info will not download into Quicken 2015.  Intuit says there is a compatibility issue with Quicken 2014 and 2015.  This is so disappointing considering they are the same company.  It has cost me lost of time to make the upgrade and then subsequently go back to my old Quicken software so I could get my work done.  I would really like my money back.<br />.
0,Difficult to use. Commands are not intuitive at all.tried to ad formulas and was unable to do so. Easier to use regular excel spreadsheet.
1,It's great to have one view for all my accounts. There is so much you can do with this from budget to debt reduction.  Highly recommend if you are looking for comparable software.
1,The software is great except for the procedure for calculating estimated tax payments.
0,Much slower than previous versions. Does not respond as quickly when selecting drop downs. I had to delete most of my accounts because of issues with trying to sync. Wasn't worth the hassle. I should have just remained with 2012 version.
0,Won't be buying this again...
0,"I have another iMac where Office for Mac works fine and I love it.<br /><br />The AMAZON DOWNLOAD is TERRIBLE!!!  DO NOT BUY IT.<br /><br />The icons for common, everyday actions have the wrong pictures on them!!!  Example:  The SAVE icon is the scissors (the CUT icon).  So, I hit CUT to SAVE!!!!  You have to be kidding. The OPEN icon shows the DECREASE DECIMAL picture.  Others are equally ridiculous.  PRINT however, is correct for some reason.....<br /><br />And software is non-returnable.  I hope someone from Amazon reads this. I will never buy downloadable software from Amazon again unless this is fixed."
0,I am having problems dounloading the The state portion of this bundle.  I have call TaxACT customer service and they could not help me due to my ordering method. (AMAZON)  I cannot review my product KEY to help the taxACT support desk.  My federal worked fine.  I am having problems registering this product.
0,sure causes slowdowns but does identify a lot of spam; also offers an upgrade to get rid of the slowdowns it creates
1,"Been using this product for years now.  Works great.<br /><br />This is the first time I have used a state version too, in my case, Arizona.  The state program is not as sophisticated.  Imagine reentering all the identifying info a second time, without even the option to copy the data from the federal data in the same file.  And the screens and Help are not as complete as the Fed version."
1,This is a better deal than re-subscribing from Norton. Woner why nobody picks up on the fact that downloads should be cheaper than buying disks.
1,"Switched from turbo tax, was very satisfied. Got the job done"
0,"I recently switched from Windows to a Mac.  I've been using Quicken for Windows for years and have been satisfied with it.  I purchased the Mac version assuming that it would be about the same product.  It definitely is not and I am very disappointed.  This version doesn't allow for the same flexibility, or at least I can't figure out how.  The account registers do not display the same, and I can't find a way to modify them.  I especially liked the bill and deposit reminders, but they seem to be absent from this version.  I also enjoyed being able to download transactions and reconcile my accounts via the internet, and this version doesn't do that well either.  I find this version to be close to useless."
1,Very happy
1,This is the second year that I have used Turbo Tax Business to complete my small business taxes.  I would not be able to do them without it.  I do wish it would have a line for mileage but with that being my major complaint I would have to say that I love it.  You must admit that a few hours of a slight headache at the cost of $105 is much better than what your accountant would charge.  If you know your EIN and State id number and have a profit/loss report from QuickBooks then you are set and can do your own returns with this software.
0,"I have used TurboTax to do our taxes for the last five years. I purchased this product- TurboTax Deluxe 2013 download to file our 2013 taxes. The state tax portion of the software wasn't clear to me, so I went to the Oregon Dept of Revenue website. There I found a link to file e-file via H&R Block for free (rather than pay the additional $20 state e-file fee.) I was curious to see if the numbers all came out the same too (they did.) I found their software even easier and quicker to use than TurboTax. I was surprised that it was completely free, including the e-file for both federal and state. Not all states are included and your AGI has to be less than $58,000, but it's worth a look if you want to save some money. I won't be buying TurboTax again!"
1,"I give it 5 stars, it is great to have"
0,Intuit why is your Mac team so terrible. I will now have to buy the Windows version and dual boot to have a usable product.<br /><br />Mac team SUCKS!
1,"I love animation and I’m glad to be living in an age when computer technology has put sophisticated animation tools within reach of casual users like me.  Purists can scoff that almost nothing is drawn by hand anymore but I’d be willing to bet that even the Nine Old Men from Disney’s golden age would be impressed by Anime Studio Pro 10.  When I found Anime Studio Debut, the entry level version, on sale for $19.00, I figured it was worth a try.  It was.  And the upgrade to Studio Pro doesn’t disappoint.<br /><br />Having tried many of the major 2D software programs (ToonBoom, Synfig, DigiCel, Flipbook, Pencil, etc) I can safely say that Anime Studio is the only one I’ve found that can have you creating animation quickly and easily right out of the box.  Just create a character by clicking through the Character Wizard, import a background and start animating.<br /><br />One thing that sets Anime Studio apart is the use of bones.  This means that after you create your character, prop, or scene you can add an animated skeleton to the figure and use it to move, squash or stretch.  This is far less tedious and more efficient than moving your figure frame by frame.  And version 10 adds some nice enhancements to the bone rigging system.<br /><br />Smart Bones will reduce or in some cases eliminate distortion around your figure’s joints.  This is especially nice for knees and elbows. With smart bone levers you can create a group of points and use them to create motions that look like 3D or create facial expressions that you can easily repeat with the turn of a dial.  There are also new bone constraints that maintain the proper angle and allow bones to squash and stretch objects.  And did I mention automatic lip synching?<br /><br />Add to this the seamless Wacom tablet support (using my Wacom Bamboo was a snap), and you have new package with lots of new features but none that feel pointless.<br /><br />A word about creating original content for Anime Studio:  There is a function that allows you to import an image and trace it in Anime Studio to create a vector image, but the results are mixed.  You would be well advised to use a free image processing program like Inkscape or Gimp to trace images, create vector images and then import and animate them.  That plus more varied and robust drawing tools would be my only suggestions for improvement.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the Anime Studio line can have you creating animations in minutes.  And the new tools are good enough to produce professional looking results.  This is a program that is worth the investment of time and money."
1,works good for now
1,We were very happy with the help you give will using Turbo Tax
1,I have used this software to prepare and E-file my Federal return and prepare my State return for mailing. I was able to get this software from Amazon cheaper than from Block. Not sure why this is the case. This year I noticed that it would cost you extra to E-file your State return which I think is different from past years. At least this software puts your information in the proper place on the forms. I had another make of tax software that would not place my information on the proper line and prevented me from manually inserting the information where it belonged.
1,The 10 year that I've used this software for my taxes
1,I am very happy with TT. It met all my needs
1,Free is a good thing and the easy ability to change the setting to your specific needs is a good thing. I would recommend this 100% all day long.
0,"I bought this last September 2013 and don't recall much trouble with installation. However, I just needed to re-install b/c of a computer crash and ran into issues with being able to access Word, Excel, etc after I installed Office. Literally could not find applications anywhere. Finally got to an online chat with Microsoft support and was told if you are running Windows 8, simply press your Microsoft button, then start typing &#34;Word&#34; or &#34;Excel.&#34; Another task bar will appear on the right of your screen and the items matching the search will appear. You can then choose the application and pin to your start menu. Not sure if this will help anyone - but it sure helped me!"
0,I downloaded this hoping to keep better track of my spending and saving. I immediately had problems downloading my banks information and so I got on with the chat help. They had me download the log files so they could look into it. A day or two later I got an email saying the issue is resolved and to try it again. Tried to add the account again and still the same error. LOL! I then got on with customer service AGAIN and they told me it was a server issue. Mind you I have tried to add this account for a good week before I even contacted them. So the server issue has been probably two weeks long. I advise if you want a working program don't buy this. It has many bugs and doesn't even have the ability to connect to some banks to download your transaction data because of server issues. Not sure how this company is staying afloat with this kind of software release. Refund and will never use again.
0,"They allow it for the personal edition, but not for business.<br /><br />I don't know whether they do this for regulatory, liability, or security reasons, but it's sort of absurd to offer it for personal and not the business edition."
1,I read the previous reviews and they are correct. This is the best choice to prepare taxes. I am very happy with this tax software.
1,"As a free antivirus, it does what it says. Excellent. Has not had any virus infection in my computers with this program"
1,"However after downloading PC Matic  and after doing just my first scan, and seeing the improvements to my pc after using other products convinced me that this time I had picked a winner.<br />Great and easy to use plus the weekly tune-ups and informative emails are great!"
1,Reports are good but need to be a little more flexible. I have been using Quicken for 15 years and love the ease of use. It really keeps me on track.
0,"I downloaded the software and seemed to work that first day. On day 2, Norton 360 was erased along with all history of the software. Now it won't download from Amazon, but I am still trying."
1,"Worked very smoothly, especially since my wife had all the necessary items in their folders, at hand at all times for the TurboTax questions.  Saved a pot full of money."
1,"Autodesk did a great job with Sketchbook Pro. Years ago, I had used a Corel product (most likely painter), which was similar to this. That program was really good. Unfortunately, once I had switched from Mac to PC, I didn't have access to it any more. I've looked off and on at some program to replace it, but just wasn't finding one that really 'clicked' with me. Found a few that did a decent job, but for one reason or another, they just didn't sit well with me. I bought the app version of this for my tablet, and thought it was quite nice. Only drawback there was using your finger to draw, and no pressure sensitivity. Decided to break out my old Wacom tablet to see if it still worked, and it did. I quickly tried out a few demos, and this was far and above the best drawing/painting program I found. Definitely worth the purchase, whether you are a seasoned artist/painter, or your greatest artistic achievement is a stick figure."
1,"It's TurboTax. The only tax software I would recommend. It is easy to use, step-by-step guide, with built-in check and balances. Even my mom can use this."
1,"EAsy to install, just enter the product key and sit back"
1,Has worked great for me for four years now after switching from TaxCut. Do our personal taxes and both my adult daughters. Very easy to use. Loads our info auto year after year Sure I save some money on things I wouldn't have known to claim. Quicker refunds and  returns. Price not bad. Less chance for audit. What's not to like?
0,Unable to install program
0,"When you need help you get put on hold, get transferred, get put on hold again.I have been waiting over 30 minutes and no real person ever came to the phone.  I have always used Turbotax Deluxe with my K-1 form without issues.  Now It is telling me I have to upgrade for 30 more dollars to premier.  When I call I can a automated message, say as of Feb. 7th, I am entitled to the free upgrade automatically.  There is no automatically. Whatever you do get upgraded before you start.  I could of gone with H and R block, they sent me a free disc. Beware."
0,"I have been a dedicated Quicken User for at least 15 years, I upgraded to 2014 from 2012 - I usually upgrade every two years or so. I am not going to write a lengthy review like some of the others. The program has major flaws, do not bother upgrading I wish I could go back to my 2012 version."
0,"The only reason why I got this is because Microsoft blocked Office 2003, the good one.<br /><br />The interface on this version is just awful. The interface is what makes these programs good. The problem is the whole ribbon thing. It makes everything hidden in plain sight. The only reason why this program gets a 2 star is because the keyboard commands still exist, if not, it would get a 1 star.<br /><br />What Microsoft fails to realize is that no one likes the GUI changes thus alienating actual PC users. They want to turn everything into a toy and tear full user control into pieces. Just look at Windows 8. No self-respecting PC user would want that. If you have a Windows XP system, I recommend getting Office 2003 over Office 2007, Office 2010, and Office 2012 any day."
0,No improvements in this version for me. Tiny fonts almost unable to read and larger fonts that won't fit in display area (words/letters cut off).  Much searching hasn't found resolution to display problems.
1,"It's just what I need to add the graphics to my daily bulletins.  I have pictures I can add, but the clip art adds nice accents, too!!"
0,"I was a little skeptical of the Mac version but it is almost the same as the windows.  Only downfall is that you need to do Payroll online and it is totally different then he window version.  If you have a problem with the payroll, be prepared to call India. Very hard to communicate with them.  That is why it only gets 4 stars.  Dont understand why they done just set it up like Windows Payroll"

0,"Norton is a fine product in general but when purchased on Amazon, there is no &#34;download&#34; button.  There is a link that gives you instructions to go to the Norton site.  Following the instructions gets you the security suite but not the utilities package.  After a useless online chat with Norton support, a very helpful tech with Amazon figured out a way to make it work using a free trial download from Norton.  What point is there in chatting online with a tech if they are not reading (or paying much attention) to what you type?  WAY too many steps.  Could have gone straight to the Norton site to get it but there is no easy way to compare apples to apples.  I trust Amazon for excellent customer service, but when the process of purchasing and installing is this complicated, it immediately initiates &#34;buyer's remorse.&#34;  ...the fact that it is non-returnable does not help"
0,"Intuit has to be one of the greediest companies around. Every piece of software is overly expensive, or there is a charge for add ons, or you get some bait/switch offer like this software, included with Turbo Tax.<br /><br />Oops, when you install it, it offers to convert an old Quicken file for you, so you can use your existing data with your new Quicken 2013. After converting it, then it tells you that you are not allowed to use data from previous versions of Quicken. You're tossed into an endless loop of starting over until you figure it out and uninstall it.<br /><br />Also, it installs extra crapware like \\""Free Credit Report\\"".<br /><br />If you have an older version of Quicken, just stick with that. I plan to. Forever."
0,"As a Quicken for Windows user for many many years, this is the worst software I have ever seen released from any software manufacturer.  I had just purchased this to migrate from windows to the Mac platform and was very excited to do this.  I downloaded the program (seamless), installed it (also seamless) and then migrated my files over from Windows to MAC (NOT SEEMLESS).  However, I was successful in doing so.  I then launched the Mac Quicken 2015 and saw my data was indeed transferred.  I was very excited, but then realized I did not have any functionality to write checks or use Quicken Bill Pay.  When I contacted support tonight, they advised me that they released the software without this functionality and were &#34;hopeful&#34; that by NEXT VERSION (note, you would have to buy that one while your current version is useless) they will have this capability.  I then asked if I could simply write a manual check in Quicken for Mac 2015, then export and import into Windows (to keep everything up to date on both) and they had to go check with the developers who said &#34;nope&#34;.<br />So, my advice to all is CAVEAT EMPTOR (Let the buyer beware).  This in my opinion (A COMPLETE WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY)."
0,"I installed it as soon as it was available, and it worked well.  After R5, however,the automatic updates for my bank stopped working, and it's a real pain to work around."
1,"This is the best antivirus ever, works great, excellent service, amazing features.  I had it for 6 years and never have a problem."
1,"The only thing that is unsatisfactory is the instruction to install updates, which is not at all user friendly  It takes a lot of effort and &#34;googling&#34; to get the instruction to get updates.  It is NOTHING LIKE WHAT THE SOFTWARE CLAIMS - &#34;click the update button.&#34;"
1,I've used Quicken for years and I loved the easy integration from my old version to the new. It was seamless and 2012 interfaced effortlessness with my online banking. Ye gotta love that!
1,"Hadn't tried tax software for ten years when it seemed more of a hassle than just doing the forms.  With the IRS adding in lots more forms over that time (that lack clear directions) and not answering their phones, I took a chance on this.  Found it very easy to use -- pretty straightforward, with easy menus, and no problems to review.  The download and immediate updates weren't a problem on a Mac laptop.<br />There was one glitch encountered re editing some stock sales, trying to correct what was mistakenly being shown as short-term holdings to long-term.  Contacted Customer Support and learned that using the Capital Gains Assistant option, rather than manually entering the data, would solve that.  I didn't have business or rental income or real estate sales.<br />Overall, found this program to be well worth it.  E-filed the federal return and sent in a paper copy for the state (to save $20 on e-filing that). There was some gift card option for customers at the end, but gave it a miss as it looked too complicated with lots of fine print.  Was happy just to have saved time and energy.  Will use a H & R Block program again."
0,"Long time Quicken User since 1995. I generally upgrade about every other year. Thanks to a lot of warnings online, I created a sandbox of my files in a Virtual Machine with Quicken 2011 and upgraded to Quicken 2013. For the first time ever, it seems to have messed up transactions, transaction totals etc. I am on Windows 7.<br /><br />Because I had adequate warnings from other users here, all I had to do was blow away my sandbox VM and go back to my original and all was well.<br /><br />Quicken needs to look at their development and QA processes and how something that significantly undermines user confidence like this could even get released! Rapid Development Processes does not mean Poor Quality is Ok.<br /><br />This is NOT a STOCKING STUFFER for 2013....  Perhaps 2014 if the kinks get worked out"

0,"As others have mentioned, I have for many years been a loyal TT user.  Those years of loyalty have gone to the wayside.  Granted, I had a &#34;complex&#34; year...sale of my home and foreign tax credits. But TT never led me to believe they were totally incapable of anything more than an EZ return.  TT Premier has failed severely to the point, after untold hours of frustration, that I've filed for an extension just so I can go shopping for alternative tax software.  I've been trying for a month+ to get some response for Intuit (I see several others looking for related help as well).  But I've received not so much as a &#34;go screw yourself&#34; response (which - excuse me, but lacking any response, is what I assume their attitude is).  Totally unacceptable to me, after 20+ years as a customer, I'm moving on."
1,"Very cool program, but no intuitive. YouTube was a big help in learning the program. I just love it now."
0,"failed to remove mysearchdialer this is a dangerous adware. I tried cuastomer support, they were less than helpful."
0,The product seems to be doing a good job protecting my laptop from viruses. The problem is that my device is old and now runs so slow I hate to even get on the computer. After each use I must completely shut down the computer in order to use it again the next time. Otherwise it does not load and freezes up and must be shut down by powering off and hard stopping it. I would only recommend this product if you have a newer computer that can handle this software.
1,"Xara Web Designer MX Premium totally rocks!    I have used a number of other web design platforms without being really exited by them.. In fact it took forever, turned out a less than savory product and support was non-existent.    It wasn't easy to take the plunge but after hours of research I narrowed my selection down to Xara and downloaded a trial..A week later I decided I had to have it and bought my license and have not looked back since!    As a traveling broker (real estate) and speculator I move from office to office and it is nice to be able to work on the computer at each location instead of just my laptop with the smaller keyboard. Comes with 3 downloads making it very portable between office, home etc.    Support is the  best I have seen.  They work on holidays too! On their site it says \\""they can only respond during office hours\\"".  It is the 4th of July and I just got an answer to a question I posted yesterday.  In fact I have had several questions and they seem to get answered within a short amount of time by email and are very helpful.  [...] has a very useful trouble shooter for their products as well as FAQ's, tutorials, and video how-to's for the novice user like me.    Their product is top notch, perfect for integrating blogs etc. into your site and unlike some other web creators you can make money on AdSense (advertising on your site where people click on the ad) without having to split the cash with them. For my son-in-laws mother that means a savings of about $800 a month.    If you like their product as well as I do they have a useful affiliate program where you can make money simply by putting a link on your website and getting paid each time an admirer purchases.    They are long on features and great support.  For under $100 what more could  you ask for?  Randall Wall"
1,Simply awesum.. :)
0,I am still awaiting to hear from Intuit for more instructions on why it doesn't load properly why wont they get back to me?
1,"I've been using Taxcut for over 10 years so I have NEVER had a problem or a tax return audited. Last year, I tried Turbotax for the first time and it was nice - a little more user friendly. However, I read some bad reviews regarding bugs for this year's (2009) Turbotax program. So I went back to TaxCut. They both are essentially the same, just different UIs.     Now, I haven't used TaxCut 2009 yet, but my Amazon download experience was flawless on my Windows 7 laptop. My install experience was also flawless - NO problems. The whole thing happened in less than 10 minutes (download and installation).    So, that's it. I read where other people were having problems downloading/installing the product, so I thought I write a review of my experience. Me have no problems!     If I do have problems on my windows 7 desktop or with the program in general, I'll update my review."
1,"New Quicken for MAC-a must buy for MAC users.  I am a Quicken 2007 user so the new 2015 is great visually and editing and data manipulation is much easier since a MAC product using the latest OSX whistles.  Import from Q2007 data was flawless to the penny for my bank and credit card imports.  A few investment imports were off in the total transaction value due to roundoff or security price differences, BUT these were easily found.  And the number was less than 15 for over 1000 transactions between 2 accounts.  3 of my 5 investment accounts had no errors.<br /><br />The only concerns are that some of my must have features (that are present in Q2007) are not yet in Q15 like calendar view of present and future transactions, as well as forecast graphs. Also the report module is not mature-there are some reports but the ability to edit the standard reports in Q2015 is limited.  The investment module has what most people need (e.g. portfolio view and transactions as well as capital gains calculations, to name a view that I use all the time) but the investment analysis is limited due to lack of some reports.  But Quicken promises many updates in the next 12 months at no cost and I have confidence they will update.  The potential list of improvements and the ability to vote is available on the Quicken product website (www.quicken.com/mac).<br /><br />Overall happy with the product.  Program is stable and import module is fast and accurate AND better than I have experienced when transitioning from Quicken windows to Q2007 and from MS MYM to Quicken for windows<br /><br />A recommend buy for MAC users.  The many features listed on the Amazon website is accurate and for added detail you can look on the Quicken/mac website.  It is a solid 4 stars and could be 5 when the updates promised are incorporated in the near future.<br /><br />The only potential downside is that you must pay to try and the cost is a  higher than Quicken competitors, but having tried the two main competitors, I believe the cost and risk is justified. I certainly picked Q2015 over others.  Note that Quicken has a 60day return policy no questions asked"

1,QuickBooks Premier Industry Editions 2013 is good enough for startups but a lot of additional features are not included in this version so ended up upgrading to the Enterprise edition instead.
1,This latest version steps you through the process with very clear instructions and questions. It makes it very easy to do my tax returns.
0,"I've been using PSE ever since it was introduced. Typically upgrading has been worthwhile every 2-3 versions, but this time I decided to step up from version 9 based on some of the new enhancement tools announced.<br /><br />First of all, PSE remains by far the best photo editor for anyone not wanting or needing the pro Photoshop software. For years I have had it loaded on two home desktops and one laptop. When I tried to install version 10 onto the third machine, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that Adobe has restricted the license to no more than two machines. That's just greedy.<br /><br />Anyhow, version 9 has remained on the third computer and now, after using both versions for several months, I have concluded that the upgrade was not worth it.<br /><br />So, five star product minus one star for a wimpy upgrade and another star for stingy licensing."
1,got the key code emailed to me. so all i had to do was bring up the norton free trial that i had and enter the key code. and the download was available if needed
1,Don't buy direct.  I have has this product for 3 years. The automatic renewal is 79.99 when you can just but it again on amazon for 39.99 and get the same great product.
0,"Slightly cumbersome to use. Customer service is horrible. Have requested refund, but no response as of yet. Microsoft Money is much better even if you can download or sync accounts."
1,Norton 360 by Symantec is one of the best security suites money can buy. Have not experienced any problems w/ this brand from day one I started using it.
1,I am running Norton Internet Security on four laptops.  For me it is the best deal and provides sound protection.
1,Great software and easy download.  Sage 50 gives you more customization than other accounting software packages.  User friendly and affordable.
1,"I have been a loyal Quicken user for years and periodically upgrade to the new version.  I decided to upgrade to 2012 and initially went to Quicken's website.  After a frustrating experience (purchasing but not being able to download, so I cancelled my order), I came to Amazon and within a few clicks my new version of Quicken 2012 was downloading.  Not only was that easily handled, but the price was as good as I could find on the internet.  No wonder Amazon continues to lead internet retailing!"
1,Easy to use.
0,"It could've been better. You cannot make your own sounds. You can put together pre-made tracks and go from there,but not what I was looking for."
1,"Software does exactly what is supposed to do and it is also very easy and flexible. The install and use is as simple, it also has a complex interface that allows for various options."
1,"All parts of the system seem to work fine. The only question remains, how well does it track inventory? The question remains, because we have only recently begun to use the system."
1,i LIKE
0,BANK DOWNLOAD IS TERRIBLE.  QUICKBOOKS KEEPS CLOSING DOWN.  I WOULD NOT HAVE UPGRADED IF I HADN'T BEEN STRONG ARMED INTO DOING SO WITH THE SO CALLED BANK DOWNLOAD UPGRADE.
1,no body does it better
1,Excellent.  Forget Roxio.  The Sony software while pricy is the best.  And you only have to buy the module's you need!
1,I like Turbo tax as it makes doing taxes easy.
1,Programs works great. Just wish it still included outlook.
1,"As a startup founder and CEO, QuickBooks Online has proven to be an indispensable (and affordable) resource as we grow our business. The secure and intuitive user experience lets me easily and effectively run our financial back-office - whenever I need to, from wherever I am.<br /><br />The word \\""product\\"" doesn't do it justice... it is the \\""solution.\\"" Kudos!"
1,love Quicken
0,"I love the accessibility and customer support has been very polite and pleasant. However, it takes a LONG time on hold and sometimes a long time to resolve.<br />Also, automatic bank feeds are still buggy or don't work at all. This is a touted feature and it really isn't there yet.<br />Some features I think worked better in my desktop version. Not sure if that is habit speaking though. We'll see.<br />And lastly, this Unapplied Cash Bill Payment account is driving me nuts!!!!!"
1,"This was a great buy my granddaughter loves it, she has some questions about usage and benefiting from it fully but for the most part she is accomplishing some of her goals"
1,"If we must have our money confiscated and wasted, at least TurboTax is a good alternative to trying to understand the overly complicated laws & regulations."
0,"It is utterly inexcusable that Intuit saw fit to release this product and charge money for it.  Readability has taken a huge hit in the register displays, which are the heart of the interface.  It's just plain hard to see rows and columns of information clearly with the near-white interface.  I've been using Quicken since the mid 1990s, and a fundamental capability it always had was to do loan amortizations, which is a critical part of how I use it for my personal financial tracking.  Somehow, they thought that this basic financial function is less important than the bells and whistles of mobile sync.  Unbelievable.  The investment tracking pages are also kneecapped relative to what Quicken 2007 can do, in which I could organize the rows by user-defined investment goal (savings, high risk, college, retirement, etc.) instead of just account.  This new version is more limited in how it lets me see that data, another key aspect of how I use the tool.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that it did import my Quicken 2007 data successfully, and I couldn't see any obvious errors.  However, the lack of a basic accounting function that its predecessors have had for nearly two decades, among other issues, makes this product worthless to me.  I'll be sticking with Q2007 for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />As others have noted, if you're going to try this out, I would recommend buying it from Intuit directly, as you'll have an easier time of getting a refund if you don't like it."
1,I have used this before and it does what it is suppose to. I would purchase here instead of on Symantec's site. Better deals on Amazon for this. Would recommend to anyone.
0,"After running my business and using Quickbooks, I expected more from Quicken for the personal money manager. It's probably better than most others that are out there, but I feel it could learn from the Quickbooks side of things and add more features.<br /><br />I'm going to continue using it and hoping for the best."
1,First time I downloaded through amazon. It was a little bit nerv racking at first but on the second time the download was completed. Called customer service and they w ere very helpfull.
1,I was able to install the TurboTax on Windows7 but it fails to install on Windows XP and that is something I am not happy about.  I prefer Windows XP for many reasons and especially for the power management which is much better than Windows7.
1,super good product thank you I will recommend to alot of my friends I know they will like it alot.
1,"My computers have been protected by Norton for years. I have been since been protected by AVAST for about two years and have been very pleased with the instant reaction to threats on the internet. The instant blocking of threats as they are detected, and the immediate alert, explaining  the threat are very much appreciated. The complete check and report on starting the computers is also appreciated. We seem to have experienced less intrusions than with previously installed competing antivirus software."
0,"It transferred my data from Quicken 2007 easily with just a few mistakes. It will not let you go to a specific date to review the worth at that time, nor can you set up mortgages, etc which are dependent on an interest rate. Hopefully they will fix more & more things & continue to improve it. I wish they could get it to work like the old (was it 2000?) Quicken on the PC side that you could project situations, how long your money would last, etc."
0,"Like the program, but if they would make it a little more user friendly, it would be a great program.<br />Like the fact that it sync's."
1,i've been using TurboTax for about 20 years. Every year it seems to get easier and easier. No reason to go to another company.
1,"I was one of the first people to use Memorang for my boards (USMLE Step 2 CK) and combined with UW I was able to score &#62; 260. My recommendation would be to use this set of flashcards as a way to &#34;learn the dots&#34; and then a QBank to help &#34;connect the dots.&#34; At the time I used it there wasn't an app yet (like there is now), but I imagine that would have been useful.<br /><br />My greatest reservation is that this type of program doesn't quite help you draw associations between concepts like a QBank does, but I'm not sure if a flashcard program is capable of that type of juggling at this point in time. Maybe one day the technology will progress to that degree."
1,awesome
1,"Purchased Norton Security -- loaded on XP and Win7. Works fine on Win7, but causes *very* slow shut-down on the XP. Checked web and turns out to be known problem. Evidently they are \\""working on it\\"" -- but it has been months and no fix yet. After many years as Norton customer, now very very disappointed and frustrated. Considering returning it and getting something else.    Update December 20. Norton's update fixed the issue; XP is now shutting down normally. Product works great but giving only four starts for releasing with bug."
1,"If you have used and liked Turbo Tax in the past, you will like 2012 just as well.  Seems to handle all the forms, is accurate and fast.  The only complaint is that it wants to print a lot of superfluous pages (first time I have used superfluous in about 30 years) every time you print a return.  You can override this, but it takes time.<br /><br />Hard to get to excited about tax software, but this is easy to follow, intuitive and fast.  I have a financial background, but I think this would be easy to use even for the less tax savvy.  Now if it could only pay taxes instead of just figuring them..."
1,I have been using Norton for more than 15 years.  Don't see any reason to change.  Easy to work with and I have never had a problem with a virus.
0,"This is the worst possible company to deal with. I updated my software online last June, then I get a pop up in November telling me to renew. Now its only December and I'm getting another pop up telling me my machine is not protected. I chatted with customer service and they could not give me a straight answer as to why I have to renew again, but they tell me I am protected for two years. Contradicting themselves at every turn. Worst support I've had to deal with in years! I'm currently looking for other virus protection and will be canceling this subscriptions ASAP!"
0,Never could get this to work right.
1,"I have used this free software for years on multiple computers. It auto updates, you can turn off the sounds and it just works! It's kept our computers virus free for over 10 years. I have recommended it to all our kids."
1,"well happy. All the stuff I need, nothing I don't"
1,"I was a little wary at first since it was free, but it actually has excellent coverage. It is lightweight and non-intrusive (you can turn the voice and ringer off in the settings). I used to buy Trend Micro all the time (also an excellent product) and Avast is just as great. I was so surprised. It shows you the name of the file or script attempting to interfere with your computer, and you have the option to individually scan files you already own if you need to. Avast also checks your computer and web browser for components that need to be updated, such as Flash, Java, and Windows OS updates. Such a helpful tool! If you need antivirus, definitely get this!"
0,"I bought this just for general budget/spending, and it is horrible.  Most of the time it won't sync up with my accounts, and when it does the numbers are all messes up.  Unfortunately, I can't get my money back.  I will never by Quicken again."
0,"The software's built-in functionality restricts taxpayers from claiming from any more than 3 states.  For those who have income to report in 4 or more states, this software will not suffice."
1,Been using avast for over ten years and have never had any downtime due to virus infestation. It does what it says it will and does it well. The free versions just as good as the paid version.  The 'big boy's can't touch this performance and price...or won't!
0,"I was dismayed by the problems I had using the Deluxe version this year!!  I had to upgrade online when I started to use it and then even had to pay $30 additionally; $25 was refunded after so many of us complained of a 'bait-and-switch' scheme this year.  When I resumed using it, I had entry problems, so bad that I had to contact Intuit directly for help.  A rep there ended up GIVING me the Premier version which was difficult to download; repeatedly tried to get it installed and finally was successful.  When I went to use the state forms, they were locked up even though I was supposed to have free access to one state for filing.  Had to contact Intuit AGAIN for help and it was eventually resolved; then had to pay $19.99 to file electronically the state copy.  I seriously doubt that I will ever use TurboTax again after many years of usage.  They seem to have lost their way!!"
0,"Work pretty good, wish there were less false positives."
0,"It is close to a one rating!!  I use as substitute for MicroSoft Money, as it is no longer supported.  Microsoft Money was great for what I used it for, checking balance and upcoming bills and deposits.  However, with all Microsoft products, it had many shortcoming.  This is especially true with regard to backup and &#34;losing&#34; data.  Quicken is not a replacement.  It does all kinds of stuff that is not really essential, but does not do the things one would like, at least without MUCH time invested.  It is similar but greatly lacks the fundamental reason for using it."
0,"I have now spent an hour trying to get this program to load onto my Mac.  I went through the download process and it says that it was downloaded, but it will not open.  I had read other similar reviews and some how thought mine would work out fine.  No such luck!  If you have a Mac, don't waste your money!"
0,"I downloaded the software yesterday to my 64 bit Windows 7 Pro computer.<br />The Software installed okay, but froze a couple of times.<br />It worked this morning, but I later installed a sound file converter called Factory Audio Converter.<br />Suddenly, when I tried to load SoundForge, I got a message SoundForge has stopped working.<br />Then I tried to load Movie Studio 13. Got the same message.<br />I uninstalled both, shut down computer and restarted.<br />Tried I reinstalled the Sony package.<br />Got the same message.<br />Now I need to find out how to return a downloaded software package I paid $104 for.<br />I do not need this headache. No time to waste another day on this.<br />Help, if you have an answer.<br />Thanks<br />C. B. Hampton"
1,Amazing program. Does everything we hoped.
1,"avast! Premier 2014 gives me complete confidence that my PC is fully protected from the many dangers that are lurking out there such as malware, spyware, phishing, etc. and the hackers who are looking to steal my personal information and identity. Customer service is outstanding and always available for support. The avast! Premier 2014 package of vigilant and protective programs for my PC are comprehensive and unequaled by any other anti-virus programs that I've used previously."
1,"Using this program was trouble free for me!  Rental income, Schedule C all included.  Importing last year's Turbo Tax return was quick and smooth.  I wasn't expecting this after reading some of the reviews, but I am definitely pleased and would recommend this to anyone who asked."
1,It's working perfectly thus far. Thank you! I will continue to use Norton 360 in the future. Thanks once again.
1,Good software for beginners
0,"The 2012 version of this product had very poorly written interview questions around defendant care tax credits which literally cost me $800 in deductions/credits.  It was dumb luck that I reviewed my taxes, found the error to correct it, and got my money back.  This 2013 version acknowledges the previous problem by re-wording the interview to prevent people from missing the deduction/credit, but it does not allow you to e-file for other reasons on those forms that the IRS says are acceptable.  After a 30 minute call to customer support on the issue, I was told that my only options were to paper file or to not take the defendant care deductions/credits so that the e-file would work.  I suggested that they were joking by suggesting that I not take a credit/deduction offered to me just to work around their software, and they said that they were not.  I will not be an H&R Block customer next year."
1,"I've been using Home & Business since 2007.  I've only had problems with one release, 2010.  This release is very similar to 2012 and todate have no problems.  I don't understand what is new in 2015 compared to 2012, but I thought I had better update before they force users to upgrade and it cost more.  I don't understand other user problems since it seams to work fine...."
1,I would deal with them again and  would recommend them to all of my friends and family. A+ A+ A+
0,"I reluctantly bought TurboTax again this year because I valued the  ability of carrying forward previous years' data. I have used Supporting Details extensively. Each year, the TurboTax \\""improvements\\"" keep sliding backwards. This year, when carrying forward supporting details, they are shuffled - last line first, first line last. Other annual improvements have been no better. I dropped buying the state forms this year because I end up doing them on TurboTax and then going to an accountant to straighten things out. Next year, I'll organize my paper, and go straight to the accountant. A once wonderful product that has moved to mediocrity. Sad."
1,"An affordable program that works well for me. My old version of Family Tree Maker would not work on Windows 7 or 8, so I bought this program and was able to import my family tree file by exporting off my old computer to Gedcom and then importing in the new program. User interface is a little different but still OK."
0,"disappointed that they disabled critical functions and did not highlight the fact. They was additional $30 to get these features, whereas getting these features using the investment and rental property would cost you only $15 more."
0,"I've installed quicken since 2003 and made many upgrades, staying on top of the latest version every year. I just installed the 2014 version and it appears to have wiped my data off the map. ALl I get is either a black or white screen with the Quicken banner. I've been struggling with the install for 3 hours. This is UNACCEPTABLE INTUIT!"
1,i would recommend avast to anyone who wants internet anti-virus rotection. utililities are simple to. i have confidence that i am protected all the time
0,"Shame on Intuit for releasing this to the public.<br /><br />No, the update patch didn't help.<br /><br />Intuit, I want my money back."
1,"I agree with other negative reviewers regarding giving a yearly \\""upgrade\\"" option to loyal customers.  Every other software works this way and I see no reason why Intuit shouldn't too.  It'd definitely keep customers locked in & happy - a win-win.    But! - and this is a BIG but :) -- When I saw the pricetag for TurboTax, I balked and went over to check out the competitor, H&R Block's TaxCut.  I was floored at the result.  When everything was calculated, TurboTax got me a return of a whopping $1500 more than TaxCut.  Now - I admit I'm not a rocket scientist - but I followed all the steps each software provided, read all the fields and entered the values asked for.      And if you check around the net, like on cNet and other online review sites, you'll see the same thing - TurboTax saved them more money than TaxCut, at least for anything more than the _most_ basic tax return.    So my overall point - TurboTax asked the right questions, and in an easy to follow, systematic way, that covered all the bases.  I _hate_ doing taxes, but TT made it less painful and more profitable than the competition - by far.     So when I saw that final price tag again - which in my case was about $70 for the online version with e-file - I paid up. $1500 versus $70?  Not a problem."
0,I'm planning to uninstall this product and just buy an excel from Microsoft. This version wasn't recognized by Microsoft and infected my excel spread sheets. I wasn't happy with this at all. I would NOT recommend this particular item.
1,"husband has yet to tell me how he likes it, sorry. but I used it and it seems pretty cool and easy to use."
1,So far it has kept my current computer safe and in good shape for several years. I feel secure navigating the internet with them on the lookout.<br /><br />Terry
1,This product is simply the best choice to do your own taxes. Don't think of another product make this your first choice.
0,"If you have an existing version of Quicken on your machine DO NOT bother trying to download and install this. As usual, Intuit has released a version of software that is crap and doesn't install properly. I've had problems before and usually waited until a version has been out for at least six months before trying to download it but I am under a bit of a time crunch so I thought I would chance it.<br /><br />I am very close to just dumping Quicken all together and just using a combination of Mint.com, ironically a free tool offered by Intuit, and spreadsheets to track my personal finances and rental property income and expenses."
1,it seems to work good but time will tell
0,"Unlike the desktop version, the online version only allows for one company file to be completed.  Additional fees apply for every additional company file that needs to be created.  If you run or operate multiple companies, the desktop version is the only way to go."
0,"I purchased the Turbo Tax Home and Business Federal+State 2009 +efile, and have tried to email Amazon on two occasions.  There is only one state return with this download!  Save yourself a headache and just go buy the software at Walmart!"
1,Excellent
0,I was never able to download it.
1,"I've been using TT for probably close to 20 years.  I was about to switch to something else this year when I initially learned that the Deluxe version would no longer support information for stocks and bonds. TT backpedaled and prior year buyers of TT Deluxe received a free upgrade to the Premiere edition.  However, I will jump ship next year if the Deluxe version does not include the above, as it has every year up to now.<br /><br />Anyway, I like the convenience of how TT automatically imports information from previous years without a lot of effort on my part.  I do not like how it almost forces you to e-file your state return, even though it costs an additional $24.95 (only Fed e-file is free).  Then, if you want to print out your state return and mail it in there's no easy way because you have to include certain fed tax return forms if you itemize, etc.  The easy solution would be if TT offered a box to click on to e-file or another box to print out and mail in your state return right next to it.<br /><br />Just a small gripe.  We will see what TT does with the Deluxe version next year."
0,"Don't know if others are easier to use, but this one literally left me hanging.<br />After double checking my entries, it pronounced my returns error-less. Problems were: after submitting payment, I was never directed back to the program for additional confirmation - the confirmation that my return was submitted. I found out after the deadline that it never went to the IRS. It also accepted my &#34;Yes&#34; to their question of &#34;Do you want to file both your Federal and State return&#34;. Problem was that my State return could not be submitted electronically. Once again, I never got a warning or error message that it was not submitted!  Will definitely try another resource next year!!!"
1,I originally bought a competitors package (TurboTax) which failed me completely in that in wouldn't bring thru information on a sale of stock from the Federal to State form. A coworker suggested the H&R Block software which came thru working without a hitch. I also like the look and feel of the H&R Block s/w - it seems to demonstrate the company's long experience with the specific job of tax prep. I will definitely be buying this again next year.
0,"If you attempt to gain help from the Chat, you will wait 30 minutes to be told there are no agents and disconnected.  If you call, you will be on hold for 45 minutes and then disconnected.

0,I have tried 5 times and will not down load and will not let me into customrer service for assistance
1,They keep improving on the bugs which is great. Good product for doing your own taxes.
0,"I do a number of book trailer videos so I am familiar with video editing and creation. The learning process for this software was overly difficult. Cartoon creation software should be written with cartoonists in mind not mechanical engineers. All I wanted to do was  put a snapshot of a persons head on a cartoon body and animate the mouth, similar to what South Park did with the Mel Gibson episode. After 3 hours of trying with absolutely no success I gave up. Fifty bucks down the drain."
0,"I have used Quicken for years for my home finances.  They now do NOT have any phone support.  It took me 2 months of trying to update my new credit card expiration date because their system wouldn't let me do it.<br />Once that finally went through, then they charged me for another Intuit online backup annual fee 6 months before it was due.  Then their chat system agent promised me a refund in 7-10 days.  Guess what - it didn't happen.<br /> After another try at chat, they disconnected me after a 3 minute wait.  Then the next agent totally did not understand that I still needed a refund, and said she could only give me a refund BY cancelling the online backup!!! She didn't seem to have read the previous chats that I sent to her.<br />She claimed the charge was a monthly charge (it wasn't, verified by the link she sent to me!)  Still have to wait another 7-10 days for a refund.  Not at all confident that they will do what they say.<br /><br />Hey Quicken - pay for PHONE SUPPORT."
1,"I've been using H&R Block tax software (formerly Tax Cut) for about 15 years. This year was predictably dependable and straightforward.  I did run into some difficulty with one part of my federal return, and I called H&R Block for help. Their customer service rep spent nearly an hour with me helping me track down the problem. Ultimately it turned out to be user error on my part. I successfully filed both my federal and state returns using this software.  I would recommend this software as a reliable, relatively easy way to prepare and file your return."
0,This product is slow and not what is advertised. Wait for a better system to be put out.
1,Wish more of avast was free or more affordable! I do love what I have at least it works .
1,"Just getting used to it, time will tell."
1,awesome software !!!!
1,Very easy to use.  Downloads all last year's data and also all bank and investment data from most large banks or investment houses.
0,Bought it but couldn't use it for what I wanted because the restrictions on this thing is ridiculous...

1,updated my expiring version with this version.  Easy!!
1,"Nothing like Word, etc.  Enjoying my favorite word processor."
0,"I was very disappointed in my purchase of the H&R Block Premium and Business Software and found the way the product was advertised to be misleading.  My goal was to find a product that would allow me to submit a business return electronically because I was filing in the State of New York where e-filing is required.  Filing a paper return in New York incurs a penalty from the State's Tax office.  In reviewing the material the product indicated it supported e-filing and no where prior to the filing step in the product does it inform you that the business forms cannot be e-filed.  I think it is terribly dishonest to advertise this product as one that allows you to e-file when in fact there is no support for e-filing business returns.  The primary reason for purchasing this product is to leverage the business return capabilities, and it should be clearly noted that the business product does not support e-file.<br /><br />This product was useless to me because the one capability I needed - e-filing to comply with New York State's mandate - was not supported.  Therefore, this product had no value to offer."
1,"I tried this and I must say it does what it says.<br />It is easy to use and has a lot of features to produce a high quality video.<br />If you can buy the full version, go ahead and do so"
1,"Far better than I expected. I had been using Turbo Tax for several years... but they have begun taking short cuts, and trimming out features. HR Block has a great presentation and features."
0,If you have ever used Turbo Tax software you will hate H&R Block. I tried to use Block for Personal & Home Business and it was so confusing I gave up and bought the higher priced Turbo Tax.  Never did get my money back from H&R Block.<br /><br />Steve
1,I have had no problems with Avast Free Antivirus  and I have been using it for a couple of years.
0,"After 1 year of paying for the CC suite, I'm out.  I use 2 of the program consistently, maybe 2 more sporadically.  At $600 per year for all the apps (I don't need) Adobe's arrogance/greed got the best of them.  I have found a great replacement for Lightroom and good enough for Photoshop.  Found a replacement for the small Dreamweaver needs I have.  Now just need to find an Illustrator and Premier replacement and I can be Adobe free forever.<br /><br />This move reminds me of Comcast's business attitude.  Short term wring the customer dry of every dime they can.  I cut the Comcast cord a year ago and never looked back, can't wait to do the same with Adobe."
0,"The first couple weeks of using Snagit software was as delightful as many other reviewers have said. However, the software suddenly stopped working all of a sudden ---- It created only 30s video no matter how long I had recorded *and* only the first 5 seconds or so of the video was live.  The rest was just a dead still image.<br /><br />I contacted Snagit's (TechSmith) technical support.  They asked for the details and an example video. I submitted those.  They asked me to try a little this or that, I did, but not working.  They came back after several weeks and gave me a preview version that was supposed to fixed the problem.  No, it did not.  Then they went silent again.  After a few months, I received the last email, basically saying that they were sorry but they cannot solve the problem.<br /><br />I was rather disappointed and gave up the software in the middle of the email exchanges.  I have switch to Screecast-O-Matic instead and this one works well up to my expectation.  (I am not affiliated nor having any interests in either of the two companies.)<br /><br />(I will update my review if I receive follow-ups from Snagit's support.)"
0,I was required to do an upgrade which I did not need to continue filing my taxes. I knew it was unnecessary in my case but turbo need more money so they got it. The required upgrade did not put a dime in my pockets but did in turbo's pocket. Good for turbo. I was in no way compensated for the previous remarks.
1,"I have to say, to my dismay I accidentally ordered the 2013 version bc when I was attempting to order 2012, which is what I needed to pay my late taxes, it popped up as a &#34;newer version&#34; and without looking it over I thought great! I'll of course order the newer version. So I wasn't able to use 2013 and had to order 2012 :-(, but I'm rating the 2013 a 5 bc the 2012 worked perfectly, easy to download and simple just like using the turbo tax website which I usually use but couldn't for a yr that had past. I def recommend turbo tax."
1,"I freaked out when my Office wouldn't work after I upgraded my Mac to OSX 10.7. I tried to get Office through my school, but they wanted over $100 for the program and I would have to wait for it to come in. I found this on Amazon, for like $80 (I bought this a long time ago, last year I think) and I had a credit on my account, I only had to pay $60 and it was a download. I installed it immediately and got back to work. I don't think I've ever been so happy about software before."
1,"This is by far MY favorite accounting program.<br />Reason - you do not have to have an online account to use.<br />- you do not have to update every year if you choose not too ( but you will have to figure out the taxes on your own) meaning you get what you pay for, but you do not pay every year $$$$$ to update a tax table. Unless you want ( I wanted a program that I would not have to pay every year to use the program)<br />-you can have more than one business.<br />- I like the easy to understand payroll records, you can print anytime frame you want, makes it easy for insurance audits and such.<br /><br />but personally I like it better than any other program that I have tried.<br /><br />-if you do not use the tax update you can not use the tax forms either :("
0,would not download at all.  couldnit use it at all
0,"It's just easier to do it online through the free Illinois site, especially if you have an unique situation.  I think they skimped on programming this year."
1,Avast has never failed me yet and I've been using their free antivirus software for about as many years as I've had a computer. I only used the Norton for one time and that was when my first computer was new and it came it came installed. Since then it's been Avast all the way.
1,I love the Organizer.  I use it every day.  I would be lost without it. It's very easy to use.
1,Detects malware that the expensive paid software miss. I recommend Avast Internet Security for complete protection and peace of mind.
0,Microsoft Sucks. We good people should not have to be subjected to use this software. Please use some other product if you can.
1,Norton is a great product. I buy new licenses every year because it is WAY cheaper than allowing it to auto-renew.
0,"Run my computer so slow, I will not recomend this item, because, my computed was good when I purchased , then after installed the whole advertising pops up... If is posible I will like to have the money back and cancel the year subscription!!!"
1,AVG AntiVirus 2015 had me sold when I used the free version and it has since protected me from all kind of malicious software threats. I was very impressed.  I think its a good software overall. It's not computer resource intensive yet gets the task of protecting your data done. So why didn't I give them 5 stars? I had an issue with uninstalling the free version which was in fact AVG company's fault..they even had a FAQ section that deals with how to remove AVG 2015 free version other than that they've been good to me. I bought this Amazon version of the software because it was the lowest-competitive price I have found on the internet.
1,I just bought this for the product key its cheeper then renewing the subscription and just as easy to do
1,"The one thing about this software I found to be a big boost to our charity donation: You can itemize all the things you donated to Goodwill and assign a value to it. Some of you might be surprised how under valued your donation might have been. Next time you take a large donation to Goodwill, write down all items and condition."
1,"Nice that I could just download the product and not waste a bunch of time or packaging material. I did have one spot of worry, my state wouldn't load and I was stuck in a loop. I had to exit (it saved all my data) and turn off my computer and go back in then everything worked fine. Yea, I'm done for another year."
0,"Bought this 2 years ago.  Problem with posting income, from day one.  Tried their on line help, didn't solve the problem.  This program is geared more for people in the business rather than one unit owners.  Finally decided to go to a spreadsheet I found on line for free.  Spreadsheet works fine and is user friendly. Deleted Quicken from my computer."
1,"This is free but work better than paid versions,<br />this does not seem to slow your computer down  and is on  the spot protection .<br />why buy antivirus when this one is free and is  very good at keeping your computer from getting a virus..download<br />it and see for yourself&#62;"
1,Keeps my PC running smoothly with only occasional manual upgrades.  Renewal process with Amazon was simple once I realized that all I needed to do was enter the key # in Norton's web site.
1,"My only issue with this is that I have a legitimate need for 3 desktop licenses, and this only allows 2. A Microsoft chat rep told me I can't even pay to purchase another license. I can use the web version for small stuff, but I use a citation manager (Mendeley) that requires the local installation.<br /><br />Short version, if you don't need to use this on more than 2 computers, but it before MS changes their mind! :)"
1,I love ESET in that it does not interfere with the settings on my computer that I have already set. It immediately found errors on my computer that McAfee did not.  McAfee also changed settings on my computer that I could not tolerate. ESET works in the background and I love it!
0,I think Microsoft Office stinks
0,"some nice improvement to help efficiency, however still does not work on high res display."
0,Last year I could submit my (insignificant) ESPP stock sales with Turbo Tax Deluxe. I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years and have always been quite happy. This year I bought Turbo Tax Deluxe as per usual and was shocked when I was told that I have to upgrade to Premier to handle my minor stock sales. The upgrade to Premier is offered at the bargain price of $30 seems like a steep addition to the $40 I paid for Deluxe.<br /><br />BOO!!!! Turbo Tax!!!<br /><br />I am now a TaxAct / H&R Block customer.
0,"I just purchased the Mac version of this software and when I run it I find that all the buttons are missing. They all show the missing image question mark icon. Makes it very hard to use, since I don't always know what I am clicking on, and also doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the software. I am not prepared to go through my tax return with software with those kinds of bugs, nor to pay for such software. Surely they have a fix for this?... A little digging around old Amazon reviews suggests that they have been dragging this bug (case ignorance inherited from DOS) around for a couple of years. I did, with some effort, put the software and its support files on a separate case-ignorant drive, and trick the system into finding them there, but why should I bother? I did pay for this software. And if they cannot make elementary software features like buttons work correctly, can they really handle the tax code?"
1,Fast and easy download
0,I have to say I am less than impressed with this product. I liked the idea of the new features but none of them work with my situation. I have accounts in various different currencies and the new features cannot deal with that . They only report dollar accounts. Also you cannot enter a paycheck unless it is going into a dollar account. Useless to me. Not worth the money.
1,"Excellent antivirus program (and one of the two best of many I've tried over the past 20 years). Powerful. Like the frequent intraday database updating (with onscreen message) and the ability for customers to configure settings preferences (not recommended for beginners). Unlike many other good antivirus programs (e.g. Bit Defender), ir doesn't take over your computer and will happily run as either primary or secondary filter with other protection programs (e.g Spybot, Zone Alarm, Advanced System Care). Only drawback found is that renewal of free license or reinstallation can be difficult and may require online help. Unrelated pop-ups an annoyance but you can set display times for most. A small price to pay for an excellent free program.<br /><br />P.S. Avast asked me (and probably all its zillion users) via a pop-up to write a review. Even provided a free Amazon review link (smart!)."
1,Pretty easy to use....this is our 3rd year using TurboTax. We just load it up and it finds the previous years' returns and copies all the pertinent data. After that its pretty much just fill in the blanks and wait for the refund to appear in the bank....less than two weeks this year.
1,"Microsoft Office 2013 is a fantastic product.  It respond great and very easy to use.<br />This product is as professional as any other.  Everyone who has a computer must get this.<br />Microsoft is the best ever.<br />Thank you,<br /><br />ncmx2"
0,Unable to submit online and difficult to make entries into the program. Changing entries would not change all places that the entries effected.
1,We bought and abandoned PaperPort when we came upon this application. It is superior to PaperPort in everyway and requires VERY little maintenance and futzing around with. This is the program to use for managing scans. PaperPort is clearly never going to produce a version that works properly.
1,"I got it because Microsoft security essentials (which is also free) stopped supporting windows xp.  I have had no viruses since installing it, and it doesn't bog down my old computer by using excessive system resources. The only drawback is it nags you about this and that once in awhile, but nowhere near the extent mcafee does (Or at least used to)."
1,"Purchased this to give as a gift to mother in-law.  The purchase process through Amazon was very convenient, and delivery via Microsoft all went very smoothly and easily."
0,I just bought this today I cannot download it. I have a 64 bit program and I lost my key and this is only a 32 bit. So a wasted 139.00.
0,"I am a expert user of Autodesk inventor and almost all other Autodesk products.  When this product came out our company purchased the ultimate edition.  In short I feel as if I am being forced to pay for beta testing of this product. And maybe this is because I come from the Inventor side of things where the product is very usable.  Fusion seems as if it is a product that needs to mature before it is usable in a engineering production type scenario. The user interface is very lacking and hard to navigate when compared to Autodesk Inventor and any other parametric software The video rendering has issues when being used with Hybrid graphics cards It has Zero integration with other Autodesk desktop software Importing and exporting native Inventor files is not easy and requires multiple steps. You need internet access to view and edit existing files.  No offline option (local copy) that I know of for current cloud based files.  But,  This software is pretty good on the CAM side and creating G-code.  It needs some work but almost everything I can created has produced good G-code.  JP"
0,"Despite the bad reviews and my dad telling me first-hand the issues he was having, I went ahead and purchased TurboTax again because it just seemed easier to continue using. Definitely a mistake. It is a mess this year. Not even sure where to start. Believe the reviews."
0,"I am a long time H&R Block user. I downloaded the program, did the updates, imported last years info and filled in all the data. I then do the same for the state. I review everything (it comes up error free) and then go through the efile process, enter bank codes and THEN it says I can't efile because I have a foreign address for my employer. I call support and after waiting 1/2 hour I'm told there's nothing they can do. After all that work, now they want me to file a paper return? I've worked for this employer for 10 years and have efiled with H&R Block (and Tax Cut before that) for as long as I can remember. I won't be buying this again."
1,"I like downloads from Amazon a whole lot more than I like suppliers sites: Amazon has servers with enough beans to handle the traffic, H&R Block doesn't. Plus, Amazon will keep a copy that I can download later, just in case I want to do my 2013 taxes incorrectly!"
1,Not much point in saying much else as it is well out of date at this point in time.  But I liked it at the time.
0,"I ripped several discs with this software but only one was a good copy.<br />The main problem was the audio and video were not synced in several discs.<br />Also the editor so you could make different clips of extra content did not work well.<br />The program would freeze OFTEN.<br />Finally I contacted support. After waiting for several WEEKS, I got a patch.<br />But that did next to nothing. I gave up on this one and am still looking for a good Ripper for Mac."
1,Have had norton for a few years running and have no problems with the system. It has saved my butt more than once!!
0,"I have been using Quicken for years and I find it very easy to use. Just took a matter of minutes to upgrade to 2015. Takes me less than a few minutes to reconcile my accounts, download updates from my bank and do a quick overview of where my finances stand. Helps me keep up to date using reminders and automatic payments and write checks through my printer and that makes it appear very professional.  (Not to mention my handwriting is pretty bad) I highly recommend it ...sure beats the heck out of using the old checkbook recorder that my wife still uses.  (She is old fashion). UPDATE: As I said above, I have been a Quicken user for years and never had a problem.  HOWEVER, after installing Quicken  Deluxe 2015, I have not been able to use the banking update feature which is the only reason I upgraded.  Quicken is not supporting any older versions for the banking update after 2014.  The software locks up during use since I upgraded, and I have only gotten to use the bank updates once.  I have been on line with Quicken troubleshooting for hours, several times (can't phone them, no phone number, have to do the on line chat), followed all their on line FAQ's for problems.  It appears they have no clue as to why this problem occurs."
0,This product is horrible.  I have been a long time TurboTax user for my small business.  Thought I would save some money by switching to H&R Block.  I saved $ but not worth the headache.  TurboTax is much easier to use.  Very confusing for the user.  I definitely will be switching back to TurboTax.
0,I've been using this product for many months now trying it out on two computers (desktop & laptop) both running Windows 8.1. So far Driver Booster has not found any new drivers. I sent an email to customer care and no reply. I had to use another product to find my lasted drivers which was many. The Driver Booster UI looks great and easy to use but it just needs to find newest drivers.
0,"I've been using Turbo Tax for 8 years now, and this is the first year where I felt like the software was not helpful.  I had to look up a lot of stuff online.  I got my taxes done, I guess that's the most important thing.  I had to do the free upgrade because I worked as a contractor for one month last year, and apparently Turbo Tax Deluxe doesn't have schedule C.  Not sure if I'm going to be using Turbo Tax next year, but we'll see..."
1,It couldn't be easier to use.  I especially like how it reviews things and asks very easy to understand questions
1,No Problems.  Works Great!  Easy to Install.  I use it with Hitman Pro.  I hope this helps you in your search.
1,그림그리기 매우 좋음 초보자 할수있어 좋아요
1,so easy! shopped around and found the best price here. plus i trusted their security! the download was trouble-free and i had my taxes done in almost no time. the only issue with Turbo-Tax is you kind of place your total trust in the software.  what if i missed something ?  it is very easy to use though.  great for most tax-payers with common sources of income.
0,"I bought this, and it worked wonders the first time. It starts off as a trial and then asks you for the code to active the product. WELL, after a few months it said my key had expired and would redirect me to the website to purchase a new key. I've had this for 6 months now and was only able to use it once on 2 devices. I'm a huge fan of AVG and trust them dearly, but I have officially been let down. I tried to contact but it is just a mess. Not sure if it's AVG or Amazon.. I bought the 2014 version in late December, which is supposed to last a whole year after activating it.."
1,I was waiting to pick up a newer version of Quicken at a low price and Amazon.com was the perfect place. Until now I was using Quicken 2003 Premier and I was slightly disappointed to find that 6 years later there are very few changes. Most of the changes are just graphical niceties that are added to the same software.     Set up was a breeze for me as I just imported my old file. The only thing that makes this buy worth while is the fact that I no longer have to enter my portfolio updates manually and can click one button to get it done (even though I seem to have issues running it some times).     I would highly recommend any financial tracking software for people to effectively manage their budgets but I think Quicken should be more value add as years go on.
0,"Upgraded my business from Quicken 2011. The conversion program fails and nothing is transferred.  Calling support was a joke. I was told to send my data file to them and they would convert it.  Why would I send my customers data to India??  Looked on their forums and this has been going on since 2012, or similar conversion problems.  No one seems to have a solution.  I want my money back, this is a ripoff."
1,I have been a long time user of Quicken. This version works as expected. No problems updating my files to this new version!! It is somewhat faster particularly in the time it takes to hook up with the Quicken Cloud. Not many other improvements from last year!
1,"I was caught by the abandon of Quicken for MAC.  This was a quick, painless conversion.  Need to learn a few new things, modify some ways you do things, but works great."
0,"I purchased SnagIt for ~half price and got a trial instead. What gives, Amazon? This is not the app's fault (it's a great app) but false advertising."
0,Did not use because of turbo tax hack.  Used a tax lawyer/ cpa.  Charged much less than your tax preparer did last year and estimated would cost this year.
0,It never downloaded.totally dissatisfied.
1,One of many Necessities for switching from a PC to a MAC.
0,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!  YOU HAVE TO BUY SEPARATE PACKAGE FOR PERSONAL: RETURN.. INTUIT IS DOING ALL IT CAN. TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS.  THESE ARE CHEAP SO AND SO'S.. For now I'll be usiing Brothers who offer both in same package.
1,This year I purchased my Annual copy of TurboTax via Amazon digital and it was the BEST experience. Fast - Easy - Download (no CD necessary). This is the Way To Go!!!!!  New Tradition :-)
1,A wonderful product. As good as Norton and McAfee but it doesn't slow down you computer. And this is just the Free version.  It's non invasive and a must have anti-virus program .
0,"I don't know what's happened to Quicken but since the 2013 version, it has been awful! It's slow and takes forever to input a transaction, especially one with splits. I could handwrite it in a register faster than Quicken responds. I just got notice of an update and after updating the program, the whole thing crashed! I called tech support and they were great showing me how to validate and rebuild the files but it crashes every time I start it and I have to validate and rebuild the files each time. Someone at Intuit needs to actually use Quicken 2014 to see how awful it is and find a fix for this!"
1,Norton has never let me down!
1,Well worth the money! I am so happy that I got this software!
1,cxcxcx
0,"I have always been a fan of Printshop, but this version is NOT user friendly.  When I try to make a landscape document, it only prints in portrait, so I'm missing half of my document!"
1,I only qualified for the standard deduction this year but have been using Turbo Tax for at least the last ten years and would not bother going back to a professional tax preparer unless I were to win a luge lottery jackpot -- then I might consider a professionals (?) advice.
1,Great security suite. Great price. Always trusted Norton and my go to AV for several years.
0,This version lacks some of the functionality of Quicken 2007.  Not an easy transition.
1,It has done well for us.
1,This photoshop makes my photgraphy look even more enhanced and beautiful<br />I tried lightroom 4 and it's more for organinzing
1,The tax system is frustrating - this makes it do-able -- barely.
1,Turbo Tax Deluxe was great
0,I have used it in 2010 and was great this time it is not very accurate it is not as good
1,"I've used various flavors of Norton software for security/antivirus/spam/tuneup/etc over the last fifteen years or so (at home and in the office).  Although its always done its core job of protecting your PC, a few years back Norton became a real performance burden so I switched to Kapersky and McAffee.  The performance issues have been resolved and Norton has earned its Editor's Choice accolades. Its a very good product.<br /><br />Pros: even smoother/easier updates (less rebooting required).  Easy upgrade from (my existing) Norton Antivirus, kept all preferences settings in email.<br /><br />Cons:  I'm not big on the Windows-8 style icons/GUI - though that's trivial.  Yearly auto-renewal, while convenient, comes in at 100% of list price! Symantec should charge only 33% or 50%"
0,"Just &#34;updated&#34; to release 6 - and the software is now worse than ever.  It literally takes 5 minutes to do an on-line account synchronization - something that took about 30 seconds in the last version.  Ironic, because they forced me to upgrade from Quicken 2011  to 2014 if I wanted to retain the ability to synchronize my on-line accounts.  Absolutely terrible product, it amazes me that no legitimate competitors have surfaced."
1,"I updated from a 2011 version, the look and layout was a bit of an adjustment from earlier version and it took a while to get a hang of it.  All and all though it is an improvement from earlier versions, and most of the annoying bugs, notably when printing reconciliations, are now gone."
1,I have had Norton internet security for years and they always want to charge 79.99 for one year renewal. Amazon has it for 22.00 and change for the SAME thing. up to 3 pc's covered and no problems downloading it from amazon. Just save your product key and when you go to renew click on already have product key and youre done!
0,"Thought I got a good deal for under $40. But the product name is very misleading. \\""+ State\\"" means JUST state regular return. If you want to E-file your state return (which most states recommends), it will charge you an extra $19.99 all the way at the end when you are about to file. Scroll down to the small print and you will read \\""Additional fees apply for efiling state returns.\\"" This is very very sneaky and misleading."
1,It is excellent.  It keeps your computer safe with a minimum of effort.  I highly recommend that everyone use avast!
1,"I have this downloaded on my computer,works very well in keeping the shysters,swindlers and thieves out with their virus infected sickness."
0,"Problems from the start.  It has been 30 days, loaded on two devices yet my account shows no devices.  Problematic to download and install.  Today, it removed itself from one device so have to download again (Know enough about computers when I would be uninstalling software, so wasn't me).  Online support section is useless.  Tells me I must be connected to the internet to run a full system scan which was never case with prior versions.  From the reviews, commenters receive a token email that says call us.  How abut being proactive and setting up a time to discuss problems.  Subscription can't be up soon enough."
1,Awesome product. You can download Office to 2 computers and I only used 1 so far but how can you go wrong for $80 for 4 yours of office....its a no brainer choice if you are in school.
0,"I ordered this because i had problems with my 2011 version and could not get any help from Quicken. I have been a Quicken customer for years, about 6 versions i have bought. Not much difference between 2011 and 2013. The price from Quicken website is too high, so i got a great price here on Amazon."
0,"I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2010 to 2013 because quicken stopped allowing 2010 to communicate with my banks.  For a company that has been around as long as Quicken, I expected that the upgrade process would be quick and painless.<br /><br />It was not!<br /><br />The program upgrade and data upgrade worked as advertized.  The problem happened when I tried to download transactions from my banks.  All failed.  After working for hours I discovered a few things that everyone should know before they upgrade:<br />1. Quicken 2013 will not pull any past transactions.  I had about a month of transactions from the last time I communicated with my banks on 2010 and when I installed 2013.  All of these transactions were lost, completely disappeared!  I had to manually enter them into Quicken and manually reconcile.<br />2. I had to re-setup every bank again!  Some of my banks I had to call and have them change some setting on my account because Quicken forces them to.<br />3. They updated the look and feel, but hid a lot of the online communication settings, so they are very hard to find.<br />4. There is no popup help on what is different between the two versions.<br /><br />Overall - shame on Quicken for releasing a product that won't upgrade from a previous version!"
0,"I became the trustee of a trust that makes annual payments to beneficiaries, files form 1041 and sends K-1 forms to the beneficiaries.  For tax year 2013 I purchased TT Deluxe for my personal taxes and TT Business for the trust and all went well.  For tax year 2014 I noticed the Home & Business. something I probably overlooked for tax year 2013.  One week ago I called TT (with much difficulty) and spoke with a very nice lady.  I specifically asked if TT Home & Business would do my personal taxes and my trust taxes including Forms 1041 and K-1.  She did not know and asked me to wait while she spoke with her supervisor.  A few minutes later she came back on the line and confirmed to me that TT Home & Business WOULD take care of both my personal taxes and my trust taxes including Forms 1041 and K-1.  I purchased TT Home & Business and downloaded it from a non-Amazon retailer.  Guess what?  I can only prepare my personal tax return.  NO Form 1041 or K-1.  It will only do Forms W-2 and 1099.  BEWARE of their customer support via telephone.<br /><br />So now I'm back at Amazon with one of their gift cards to purchase TT Business for my trust  like I did for tax year 2013.  I'll eat the difference in price between Deluxe and Home & Business and prepare my personal taxes on Home & Business.  Lesson learned."
0,"It has too many false warnings. &#34;All your browser add-ons are malicious&#34;  &#34;28 programs are slowing down your computer!&#34;  and they are just ways to make you install even more software that's even more invasive, or that costs money, or both.  I guess you get what you pay for with this."
1,Especially glad Avast still supports Windows  xp.
1,It's Norton. Not much to be said. You either like them or you don't or have other preferences. I have had no issues with Norton. I also like the ease of just ordering the product key and then inputting it into existing Norton account for another year of internet security.
1,"We are using Chief Architect Home Designer to layout the floor plan and equipment placement in the building my wife is considering buying for her small business. This is a very powerful tool once you get past the fairly steep learning curve, and I recommend taking advantage of the numerous helpful video tutorials to get the most out of the program.<br /><br />The interface is intuitive and well thought out once you understand what each of the tools are used for. I like how the program automatically recognizes what you are probably trying to draw and makes corrections on the fly, like for window, door, and wall placements.<br /><br />We save a base design of our building's floor plan and then modify it to see how our ideas will actually workout, saving each new one as a different name. This has saved us time and trouble by getting a feel if a particular equipment setup will work out, before moving heavy equipment around.<br /><br />This is the first Architect software I have used, so don't have anything to compare it to, but it is much better and more fun than using graph paper.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
1,Great deal.
1,Wonderful product.  Gets the job done!
0,"I've been using Quicken for many years.  It always does the job in a not too impressive fashion.  The 2011 version has some nice features.  I especially appreciate being able to import transactions from my bank accounts. Quicken makes you \\""upgrade\\"" every few years or you lose the ability to download. (Nice guys!)    The program itself acts a bit buggy at times but if you keep trying it will work.    Before I bought Quicken Deluxe 2011 I looked all around for alternatives but did not find anything that would work for me. MS Money is no longer available.  I looked at several others including MINT.  The big problem with all of the others (that I found) is that they keep your transaction data on their \\""cloud\\"".  Transactions made more than 90 days or so before the current date are not available. Makes it tough come Tax time."
0,I did the automatic install and my computer has slowed downloads drastically.  Any solutions????
1,Great and On-time Delivery
1,Meets all of our internet needs and security. I would recommend to anyone looking for a first rate security system.
1,"It is much better than AVG. It doesn't seem to slow down my computer start-up, but seems to give good protection."
0,"This is another toolbar with the 20 other toolbars from Steam and other game developers. This one interrupts you while you are playing other games. You could be in a WOW Raid and get a pop-up informing you that a friend logged in or having someone message you.  It can be quite annoying when you're killing a boss and the screen is diverted away because of a pop-up. I hate these toolbars and the fact that game developers all try to force you to use theirs. The result is, you have 50 games and 10 toolbars to manage them. Let's get rid of these toolbars. I find that the Icon on my desktop works just fine to start the game.  After the game is started, I can play without interruption, which is all I wanted to do."
1,"At a time when many Americans are finding it hard to ever retire, Mr. Shackelford has created a great aid.  Should be used in high school courses to give students a heads up on what they will need to do to retire and live comfortably."
1,Phenomenal
1,Excellent service. I am on many couponing sites which are known to have viruses and Avast has captured every single one.<br />Thanks
1,"Great product , works as described"
1,"This little software package is ideal for those of us want a simple, yet functional program, that will help us track our spending. Reconciling bank statements for checking and savings accounts is straight-forward and simple. If all you want is to keep up with household banking, this is great!"
1,I choice this because I am a student and it is free. Thanks so much! It downloaded fast and seems to be taking care of the bugs!
1,I bought this software after my last trip to H&R cost me $300+ for one year's taxes.  Purchased for $9.95 after April 15th.  I'll pay full price for it next time to get the money faster.  Worked like a charm.  Step-by-step instructions were easy to understand.
0,"First time user of AVG, had heard a great deal so tried out. First mistake, second mistake took a 2 yr subscription. After a few days one of my home computers got affected by a trojan that AVG could do nothing about. Took it to the shop and they suggested to use a better anti-virus software. So basically need to forget the avg subscrition and buy mc afee in order to save my computers.    Don't buy even if its the last anti-virus software on earth."
0,"R6 (23.1.6.15) upgrade is completely flawed.<br />I have used Q for a decade, and been satisfied.<br />I have even liked the new app for the iPhone, although it too is glitch.<br />With this recent upgrade, the s/w crashes each time I boot, and it will not function even when it says live.<br />I limp along with a very poorly functioning s/w.<br />I too have found telephone support completely useless.<br />They seem more concerned with telling you that the problem is yours and Microsoft's and not theirs.<br />The have NEVER, in TEN years, EVER been supportive or offered to take the blame for malfunctioning s/w.<br />While I would recommend Q to others, and have, this latest version upgrade needs to be scrapped.<br />At very least, they need to allow all customers to undo an upgrade and return to a prior functional version whenever they wish.<br />Our finances, in many cases, DEPEND upon this s/w, and their appreciation of that fact is MINIMAL at best."
1,"Long time user of Norton, no concerns with the software and love the ease of locating my software in case of a re-install."
0,"I like the update.  It was a bit expensive and still lacks some features, but I'm sticking with Quicken after using it for so long.  It's still the most useful for me.  I particularly like integration with my iPhone and that that's not a separate program that costs."
0,the code for free efile did not work. otherwise the program worked fine.  this is the second year the code has not worked.
0,"I've been using this software ever since Intuit started selling it. Every year they rip off the customer in a new and exciting manner.  This year's &#34;feature&#34; is that they removed the Schedule F (for farming income), and they clearly tell you when you're ready to work on that aspect of taxes that you have to PAY an additional $10 to have access to that form.  Not me.  Thankfully, I did tax returns manually for many years before this obnoxious company came along, and I'll go back to that method immediately."
0,"Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.<br /><br />Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview<br /><br />I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.<br /><br />In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.<br /><br />Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.<br /><br />The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance."
0,"It is disappointing that even though E*Trade is listed as one of the Financial Institutions to download the 1099 forms; it does not work.  I entered my E*Trade account login and password, and I get error 2000.  I contacted E*Trade, and they informed that the problem is on the H&R Block side.  I contacted H&R Block, and their solution: manually enter the 1099 data.  Time to move back to Turbo Tax."
1,"AVAST makes the third antivirus software I have used since PCs came on the market.  I dumped the first two because they became to pushy, wanted to tell ME how/where/what I was going to do on my computer.  Then I read, or heard, I don't remember, about AVAST and checked it out by downloading the free version.  From the first day I downloaded the software, to the present, AVAST has sat in the background and &#34;done its own thing.&#34;  I was so impressed by the free version that I purchased the Internet Security package.<br /><br />I don't have to worry about popups occurring several times a session while on the computer, it scans all e-mails and downloads, all the while sitting in the background &#34;doing its own thing.&#34;  And should it detect a bad guy then and only then do you see a warning popup on the screen.  I also find it does a very nice job scanning the entire system for anything which might have snuck by accident, which does occur from time to time.  There are some features of this software I don't use, either because I don't really need them or can't afford to activate them.<br /><br />Overall, it is a really nice program, one I would like to have seen when PCs first came on the market.  But I'm glad a group of people put their heads together and came up with which is easy to use, sits in the background &#34;doing it's own thing,&#34; and something which I tell others about."
0,"I have used Quicken software for years and purchased this 2013 software for the mobile feature.  However after syching the data to the cloud the data become corrupt and account balances are not correct.  I have spent hours each month correcting account balances.  I have tried other reviewers suggestions by unlinking the cloud id and the issue was resolved for a few months, however the problem is back again. Unless you have endless hours to keep correcting the downloads or are available for continued tech support - do not buy this."
0,"I am thoroughly disgusted with Turbo Tax.  First of all they tried to pull a fast one one and charge more for the same package.  Oooops! they said, silly us, we made a typo.  Lie!  Last year, I got Kaspersky free with Turbo from Fry's; this year nothing.  Then Turbo Tax says, file Electronically to speed your refund.  Get it within 21 days.  Wrong, They lied.  They have screwed up so badly this year that they cannot tell the truth, del;iver their promises, and CANNOT BE REACHED to express your disappointment.  I will never use Turbo Tax again."
0,I will never buy another Norton product as long as I live.  they have decided not to validate any product that has not been bought on their webb site. Now I have 5 computers with no protection after an hour working with their tec support trying to install. They said I would have to get another validation number from the online retailer.  I guess this is there way of making sure that you have to pay 3 times as much to renew on their webb site.
1,Awesome! I've never been more pleased with an antivirus program.
1,"Is pretty much self explanitory to use, great for the basic homeowner"
1,Only really bought it because I had to but it does what it should. I don't always like Norton products but you really can't beat this for the price of it!
0,"It may partly my fault, but I was told that all TurboTax &#34;Deluxe&#34; products included State also. Not free download, but State. It did not and I looked back this package did not have state. ? When I called TurboTax, they also said Deluxe included State. So, I don't get it. It was  a great inconvenance not to have State included. I think I will try a different company next year."
0,avast was recommended by acomputer repair guy....he told me it will not slow my computer down like norton.  It keeps my computer up to date without lots of maintanence.
0,"Update, May 2014<br /><br />The bug described below in the original review (below) has yet to be fixed, and it's starting to annoy. You have to be hyper-vigilant with accepting downloaded investment transactions; I typically download transactions in the wee hours, after I get up and just get started with a coffee. In hindsight, maybe I should do it when I'm more with it, as this bug has bitten me a few more times. Vanguard-- a great institution, even if they multiply sub-accounts way beyond necessity-- is particularly dangerous, as their downloads don't seem to mesh well with Quicken.<br /><br />I believe gambling is unwise, but if I had to wager, I'd bet that this bug never gets fixed in Q2014. In other words, maybe Intuit will get it fixed by the next time I upgrade, in 2017 (when I buy a discounted copy of Q2016). No more will I shell out full MSRP for the latest and greatest in insufficiently-tested Q20XX software.<br /><br />I've had some more experience with this software since writing the review below, and I have discovered a few more \\""easter eggs.\\"" For example, I discovered this edition can \\""forget\\"" long-used payees... the kind that appear 20 or 30 times in a register over the span of a year or two. I type the first few letters of the payee's name, and the software is drawing a blank, so I have to go back and find an old transaction to be sure I retype the name exactly the same way for the next transaction. It is also very poor at matching transactions, even checks with a unique check number. Please, understand that I don't passively wait for transactions to download before entering them, but rather I enter *everything* manually and then match it when it downloads. So even though it is apparently asking too much for the software to be able to automatically match a downloaded transaction for check #83723 (which agrees with the previously entered transaction for check #83723 on the basis of the check number, account, and amount), hope springs eternal that I will eventually be able to allow the software to make that match automatically, and I can stop having to make the match manually. Sheesh!<br /><br />Another really annoying feature is the inability of the software to do downloading in the background. With Q2011, I'd fire up the downloading and go back to my Web browser or email client. To be fair, downloading with Q2011 seemed to take longer than Q2014, but at least it would do it's thing in the background. But Q2014 NEEDS to be on the top. You can't do anything for long while it downloads; it will displace any other program so as to be unhidden/unminimized on your desktop. At least on my machine, that's what it does. Drives me nuts. I've gotten to the point where I just start the download and walk away while Q2014 monopolizes my desktop PC, the one with 12GB of memory and a quad core.<br /><br />Intuit, will you be compensating me for my time as a beta-tester?<br /><br />======================<br /><br />Brief summary: the critical reviews here are well-deserved. Intuit seems committed to public beta-testing of supposedly finished products.<br /><br />Detailed review: long-time Quicken user, for 15+ years. I normally try to minimize the cost of the mandatory upgrades by delaying as long as possible and buying last year's edition. But when I read that the mobile app-- something I have been waiting for a long time-- released with Quicken 2013 would only work with Quicken 2013, and I read the reviews here which blasted Quicken 2013, I decided maybe I would bite the bullet and pay retail for a current edition (Quicken 2014 Premier).<br /><br />I would much prefer if Intuit would simply release a truly polished version of Quicken and charge users annually for downloading/upgrading, rather than this near bait-and-switch cycle of mandatory upgrades. However I will admit to softening the blows a little bit by holding some shares of INTU which appreciated nicely over the past few years.<br /><br />In any case, I was motivatedto write this review after encountering a very annoying bug in the 2014 Premier version. Search for it using the phrase \\""this transaction was created as a transfer to an investment transaction.\\"" The error message also says \\""In order to change it, you must go to the source transaction using 'Go To Matching Transfer' from the Edit button.\\""<br /><br />This bug seems to surface in IRA accounts and prevents editing/deleting/changing investment transactions for whatever reason. Following the instructions-- i.e., using the \\""Go To Matching Transfer\\"" function-- does not solve the problem. So the downloaded transactions that I carelessly accepted, which were incorrectly recorded, now seem to be etched in stone, and the investment accounts that I have faithfully reconciled for lo, these 15+ years, now require some kind of accounting trickery to reconcile.<br /><br />Hopefully the folks at Intuit will devote some time & money to fixing this bug. I've wasted plenty of time on it myself."
1,"How does one know when something is working?  When I run a particular brand of motor oil in my car, short of doing a laboratory test on the oil when I drain it, I suppose the fact the engine is still running and isn't smoking indicates a degree of success with that particular lubricant.<br /><br />I had a competitor's anti-virus on my last computer.  Every time I turned on my computer, the scan of the system would begin, rendering my computer basically unusable for 15-30 minutes. I installed AVAST in my new computer which I bought last year.  I can't tell when AVAST scans, and the computer works well.<br /><br /> I guess, like motor oil, it seems to be working fine, because nothing is broken, and I don't have to wait for the scan to finish to use the computer.  I am very pleased."
0,"1. Waited close to an hour to talk to an 'expert' with questions about wash sales and limited partnerships.  the expert was totally unconvincing and I had to look elsewhere.<br />2. Although the questionnaire asks for the taxable amount of IRA distributions, form 1040 does not show this and it is necessary either to override or fill out another form."
1,good product I have used it for 7 years
0,"My problem: just one simple omittance in Q2013 -- Removal of the \\""FIND\\"" option in the upper right account screen.  I'm moving back to Q2012 even though my lengthy HELP call to an Asian tech finally found a complicated, partial fix which is still unsatisfactory compared to the Q2012 option.  How Q2013 designers could have made such a gross error is unfathomable, regrettable, and unfortunate and stands as a ridiculous inconvenience to Q customers."
0,I installed the software on a desktop computer running Windows 7 and the computer crushed. Amazon has a &#34;No Return/Credit&#34; policy on this item.
0,"I am facing a somewhat forced conversion from Quicken for Windows, and I was not really in the mood to lose 6 years of financial data and 15 years of loyalty to the Quicken brand name.  I read the negative reviews both on Amazon and the App store and thought, \\""OK, it might not be the best software on the market, but at least I can get by until something better comes along - right?\\""  No, oh no, no, no, no - it is worse than the reviews state.  I probably had more functionality in the Windows 95 release than I have with Quicken Essentials.  The loss of the ability to track individual investments means I no longer have an idea where I am financially at any given time, which is the whole point of Quicken software.  It will not even track transfers from a bank account into a brokerage account which is such a basic function I cannot imagine getting by without it.  I am trying to kludge something together to make it work - I think the best alternative at this point is to run Quicken for Windows under Wine and hope for the best.  I am sorely disappointed in the performance of this product."
1,"We have used Avast (and it's predecessor) for many years. We have been told to use other more expensive programs, but since using Avast we have not had any issues. Like they say - If it ain't broke, don't fix it! And it's free to boot!!"
1,"Great product, brought forward by a great company. Sleek style, function, and user friendly beyond words. Definitely beats the older versions, thanks!"
0,The &#34;actors&#34; in this online class are european (not hawaiian) and it's obvious they are mouthing the words while someone else speaks.  It's really distracting and annoying.  And the language learning techniques they have are not that great.  It's ok but I wouldn't recommend it.
1,"Very good program, have used 2003, 2009 & now 2013... It does pay to upgrade!!! Would highly recommend this program to anyone who travels..."
1,"It was little confusing at first, But they helped me, It was easy to down load, And i did not have to risk buying a cd , Not knowing if it could work on my pc, This is good, Easy to use and fun for her. Thank you. Casandra"
0,I would like it better if you could control the curser movement by the enter key like previous versions.  Also if when adding an entry it would pick up the current date.
0,"The ability to share the subscription with family members is a great idea, but it frequently fails to work.  The account management page returns error codes every time I try to send an invite to a family member despite the fact that all of my sharing slots are unused.  The support on this product is far shoddier than I would have expected from Microsoft."
0,"After I purchased this payroll product and used it for several months Intuit started charging our firm a monthly fee for processing, on top of the fee we paid for software.  This is a new billing practice for them (I've been using their payroll for 4 years now and there have never been any additional charges) so be aware they have changed how they charge for payroll.  They force you to provide a credit card number to activate the account.<br /><br />Otherwise the software works fine but I really hate it when companies play games and implement new fees after you've purchased their product."
1,Office for Mac is a must have for any Mac users. As a college student it is a great way to get my work done at home and not have to use the universities computers.
1,excellent
0,"I have use computer recipe organizer software for years.  This is by far the worst I have tried.  It does not import from any other program, so it is only useful if you are starting a cookbook from scratch.  I tried entering 5 recipes, and each one had at least 1 ingredient that was not in the ingredient list.  Almond slivers and ginger are not exactly rare items, so not having them in the list is odd.  Good program for a novice who has very simple recipes, but for anyone who is a serious user they should look elsewhere."
1,"I do not see an appreciable difference between 2014 version and 2015 version.  I love Quicken, and I would not be able to budget my household expenses without it!"
1,Perfect as always
1,My buy of this software for the third time because of its extensive range of functions and easy to use.
0,Downloaded attempt 3 times..but HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN IT ON MY acer laptop.<br />It will  not open.  Need refund..another dissapointment from this company.  What is customer service #?
1,Very pleased & the fact that it is free is helpful to my budget.
1,"Must have for the amateur digital photographer.  My experience has been that most Adobe products are hard to learn in one sitting.  This one is no exception, if you are like me, you will learn it one trick at a time too."
1,I have used Avast for over 10 years with confidence and still virus free.
0,"Avast is a Virus! Their whole communication system is overwrought and intentionally complicated, its a very SHADY company, after spending 60 worthless minutes on the phone with these &#34;people' i was advised that I would have to pay $77 for getting my comp in order, I told that &#34;lady&#34; where to stuff it i am pretty savvy and have good &#34;scam antenna&#34; but i feel sorry for the ones who fall for this thievery. They actually asked me questions like &#34;do you do your banking on this computer&#34;? Do you have financial records? Imagine this. Creeps!"
0,"Could not get Wells Fargo investments to import automatically OR using export files from the website after trying for an hour.  That was the main reason I bought this.  It's also clunky and it crashed once.<br /><br />The checking account import worked marginally better.  It is missing today's transactions.  Can't tell if it's delayed or what, but I also was able to screw up the balances even further while trying to figure out how to use this software and adjust spending categories.  So it's not even synced up with my accounts anymore.<br /><br />Going to see if this 60-day money back guarantee is for real."
1,"Love it! Download available immediately after checkout completed.  Easy to follow easy to use, definately an A+++++.  Will use this again next year"
1,"Our IT person recommended this solution after we struggled with all the other ones including the best known ones.  We needed a simple elegant and practical with a low overhead,  avast! has met and exceeded all of our expectations.  THANK YOU"
1,"The map download was a great price.  I have waited for about 4 or 5 months to purchase it due to it being unavailable.  I feel that it was rediculous that a download would be unavailable for months.<br />Figuring out how to get it to download was unnecessarily confusing and very frustrating.  If you are going to sell it, you should include simple, correct instructions.  The reason I'm giving it it four stars instead of five is due to the poor instructions.  I've used the gps one time since downloading the new maps and it routed me around some construction, so I feel that the download was up to date."
1,i think avast is a very good Antivirus. saved my computer a few times. i had virus come with my email and avast .
0,Have used it for many years but they are now being very petty and forcing an upgrade to get basic forms. &#34;D&#34; for example. I'm sure there have been many thousands of consumers that have previously purchased this software.They are chasing the customers away. Bonehead decision!<br /><br />The free upgrade is not being offered to me when I try to upgrade the software. When I choose the upgrade option it states that my software is up to date.<br /><br />When I try to upgrade I continually get an error message. I have called the phone number and have been on hold for 30 minutes so far.<br /><br />My tax preparation is now on hold. Thanks!!!
0,I purchased this product in Germany and when I tried to use it I got a message saying it can't be used over seas.  I tried returning the product for a refund but I only got the run around.  I ended up buying the same product from MS.com and it works fine.  If Amazon is going to sell a product then it shoul work regardless of where you are.  I still have the product and I still would like a refund!
0,"Install was easy, but not impressed past that. Cant download transactions. Seems to be full of bugs!<br />I went back to the old version!"
1,"Interior Design 17.5 is handy for visualizing renovations for you home. I find it to be easy and fun to use.  It does take some time to find your way around the different libraries, there are many materials and objects to choose from.  Interior Design also comes with Power Tools for making your own Doors, Windows, Fireplace, Estimator for materials and Photo View tool  to add your photos as backgrounds for renovations. Some of these features are only found in the higher Product packages.    I gave it 4 Stars because I do like using it. I would give it 5 Stars if it could render out a little higher and export out to .3DS.    From some reviews, people get hung up on the Quickstart screen. True, you can't save your drawing in the Quickstart screen.  Press the Continue Button to go to the next screen, from there you will be able to move/edit/delete walls and save your drawing.  You don't have to use the Quickstart. Just press the Continue Button at the top of the palette and you can draw your own walls  from scratch and edit them as needed."
0,Outlook doesn't always display emails properly.
0,"WOW! What a mess! It will not sync with my bank at all. It pretends to sync and has no problems, but shows zero transactions.  Even a manual import/export produces errors.  The transactions I import are not complete and do not show the correct balance. One account is more and two are less than they should be. This isn't due to transactions not being posted yet...they are just wrong. I was hoping to do better than mint.com, but this isn't the way. DO NOT BUY!!! I have an email into Amazon. I hope they will give me my money back as I only paid for this a few hours ago."
1,TurboTax has been the flagship of tax prep. software for years.  I have used it every year since 1991.  It gets better and easier to use every year.
1,"Hi, this product installed easily, works great, I have not had a glitch in about a year of usage, I've had earlier versions of MasterCook and other recipe programs but this one is the easiest to use and definitely my favorite. It is also the best price of the paid for programs."

0,"Understand that I've used Turbo Tax faithfully, each and every year, for almost 20 years. (I first bought TT in 1994, when it came on a bazillion floppy disks.) But that's all over now; 2014 will be the year I switch to other tax prep software. (Likely, judging from the reviews here on Amazon, any of H&R Block's products will serve me just fine at a reasonable price, and import all my past TT data, too.) While I'm sure the 2014 version of TurboTax Home and Business does work, with all the (appreciated) strengths and (occasionally maddening) weaknesses it's always had, I refuse to endorse Intuit's blatant extortion tactics by purchasing any of them - really, that's the bottom line.<br /><br />In the past, all TT versions, even the most basic ones, could still prepare and e-file any common schedule - e.g., A/B/C/D/E/F - no matter what your situation was. Maybe the cheaper versions (eg, TT Basic) you got a little less guidance, maybe they had a few less fancy deduction-finding steps - but you could depend on every one of them being able to do its job with no surprises and let you finish and file your taxes. (If your tax situation was truly complex or strange, such that TT couldn't manage it, you'd almost certainly have had a tax pro handling your return anyways.) But that's all over now: for 2014, Intuit has intentionally and systematically crippled each of their products in what can only be described as a blatant, deeply cynical money grab. For example, anyone filing more than a ridiculously trivial Schedule C is now forced into using Intuit's most expensive product (this one). That would be bad enough, but vital knowledge that would clue a buyer into the situation in advance - such that other versions can't handle one of Schedules B/C/D/E at all, or worse, claim they can but then limit it in some ridiculous way (e.g.: crippled so you can't enter business expenses of more than $100!) - well, those salient facts are buried deep in the fine fine print of the product specs. This bait-and-switch ensures buyers of TurboTax Basic and Deluxe and Premier (huh?!! it's called 'Premier' and it can't fill out a basic Schedule C?? wtf??) - well, those folks will have the noose tightened around their necks before they realize they're going to have to cough up more $$$ to Intuit for a forced upgrade - just to complete a return they've already started.<br /><br />This \\""profit-first, profit-second, profit-third, oh-and-customer: last\\"" approach really feels similar to the \\""forced upgrade\\"" tactics that Intuit's been pulling for years with their increasingly bloated releases of Quicken (another product I've used for 20+ years but stopped buying in the last few). As a corporate entity, Intuit's cynical greed makes Microsoft and their past sleazy tactics with Windows and Office upgrades look like a kid bullying his classmates for their lunch money. For me, enough is enough, especially when there are better and cheaper alternatives to TurboTax out there. Goodbye.bait-and-switch ensures buyers of TurboTax Basic and Deluxe and Premier (huh?!! it's called 'Premier' and it can't fill out a basic Schedule C?? wtf??) - well, those folks will have the noose tightened around their necks before they realize they're going to have to cough up more $$$ to Intuit for a forced upgrade - just to complete a return they've already started.

1,"What can you say, it's tax software. It either works or it doesn't. At least H&R didn't pull the stupid stunt and screw all their customers like TT did this year.  And for some reason, lots of TT users are ending up reporting tax fraud for returns already filed by other people.  Hmmmm.....<br /><br />I made the switch from TT to H&R years ago when TT got too big for their britches and started charging more money for the equivalent product.  Each product has its plusses and minuses but H&R works fine for me and I file Schedule E, multiple Schedule C's, Form 8something for Home Office use, lots of assets to depreciate and H&R has never had a problem. I can go straight to the form if needed. I was able to use it when a business that I had stock in sold and I had to enter K-1 forms for multiple years (and write big checks for capital gains)<br /><br />I read through the extensive list of Q&A on Amazon before buying and became amazed at all the repeat questions for people who apparently don't know how to put a little effort to see if their question has already been asked.<br /><br />To answer what I saw as the most repeated questions, H&R Deluxe plus State does or does not:<br /><br />Does allow 5 free federal online filings<br />Does allow one (1) free state to be downloaded<br />Does allow the state to be filed online at a cost of $19.95 each (Nowhere does it say the state filing is free)<br />Does allow you to purchase additional states at some cost<br />Does include Schedules C, D, E, F etc.<br />Does include the form for use of a home office<br />Does do depreciation of assets<br />Does handle K1's and sale of a small business with the associated capital gains<br /><br />From all my research from this year and years previous, the Premium version doesn't add any actual forms or capability, just tools to help guide the user for advanced forms such as Schedule C.  If you need a form that this software doesn't have then you probably need to go to a CPA anyway.<br /><br/>I give only 4 stars because there are always some little features I don't like. For instance, when you create a list of items for a particular field, the list is tied to that field but opening the list after it is created makes you scroll through all the lists which is cumbersome.  This should be an easy fix they could so.  Also, some of the included tax help is pretty generic and I end up going to the IRS web site and getting the forms or pamphlets to read more in depth about what certain fields are looking for and what is or is not allowable. Not hard to do just takes a little time."
0,"Installed Norton 360 on my new Lenova Ideapad laptop.  Previous to installing 360, I could let the laptop go to sleep and the battery would stay charged. After installing 360, the laptop would lose all of its battery after going to sleep.  I uninstalled 360 and the laptop functions well again. I am not happy about this purchase."
0,"I bought this yesterday to do an history paper. It never would open. I went to the Microsoft website and it said they were having site problems. I asked for a refund since it's totally worthless to me now. They said I had to get my refund through Amazon, who will not refund my money. $80 down the drain!!!"
1,"I purchased Adobe Cloud to have access to several Adobe software that I use so I decided to join their NEW monthly membership; however, I was used to using the ancient Photoshop CS and AI CS2 and when I saw how complex the new versions looked, I was overwhelmed but when I saw that I could learn and use the Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 within a few minutes of watching a short demo on Adobe I knew I needed to purchase it quickly.<br /><br />I am so glad I was able to find it on Amazon and purchase it for much less.  And glad that it works great on my new HP Windows 8 computer, this saved me until I was able to learn how to work with the new PS and AI. :)"
0,"Only reason I got 2013 was b/c online support for prior version was going away.  The 2013 version makes it harder to do a number of ordinary activities, such as clearing checks, reconciling accounts on monthly basis, adding accounts for online updates.  They've either eliminated one-step buttons, hidden the buttons, eliminated the ability to accomplish tasks with a keystroke (insisting instead on selecting option from pulldown menus -- making the accomplishment of the task take longer and less intuitive).  Nothing I've yet found in this version is truly an improvement over the prior version.  Unfortunately, one will have to buy it if one wants to continue to have customer support and online functionality and support."
1,"Does exactly what I need it to do. My taxes are pretty basic as it is: house, kids, daycare, charitable donations, home office, etc... This works for me. Make sure you read descriptions of what each version of TurboTax does to ensure it can handle your specific situation."
1,A Great Free Download!
0,"I liked wordperfect years ago, but went to another program for convenience. Decided to give it another try, but did not like the new version at all."
1,Worked great.
0,"I am a MA state school employee and we do not pay into social security but have a pension plan.  When preparing my MA return with TurboTax, the program automatically deducted $2,000 from my MA income for payments into Social Security, this is incorrect and I only caught this error because I am a tax preparer.  I called and e-mailed TurboTax but no one replied.  I am furious because I can't use the MA return and I had to pay $40 to get to see it.  I want a refund of the amount paid to TurboTax and they should correct their program.  I am irate."
1,Bought this vs renewing direct thru Norton and saved a bundle.  Definitely a good buy.  Updated directly throu my Norton account too!
0,I was never able to sign in running in VMware Fusion.  After several support calls gave up and went back to 2013.  Frustrating.  Couldn't even get my money back.
0,"I originally purchased this product direcly from DVO.  After I installed it it worked great and I loved it.  I even added some of my own recipes.  Then when I went back the next day to add more recipes the program wouldn't open.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps the program became corrupted so I untinstalled and reinstalled several times, per instructions from DVO, but it still wouldn't work.<br /><br />So I downloaded it from Amazon. Not only was Amazon's version much smaller, but it didn't work either.<br /><br />It's now uninstalled.  :("
0,I bought the download version of norton 1 yr subscription back in November 2014 worked well. That was until today when it said my subscription jas expired after tell me before updates that my subscription didnt expired for another over another 200 day. Help please.
1,"So far I've just used this to capture streaming video, which it does very well. It has crashed on me a bunch of times when I let the recording go over 1.5 hours... sometimes it would keep the file sometimes it would be lost. Overall though, I think it works great and would certainly recommend it with the caveat that it may take a little trial and error to see where the sweet spot is for recording length on your particular hardware. Also split a couple of videos which worked perfectly every time. Video and sound quality of recording matched original stream perfectly. I haven't encountered a better way as yet to capture something like the Tour De France..."
0,"Watch for the bait-and-switch here.    5/1 email says offer good until 5/15, with legal fine print allowing them to say, in effect, \\""just kidding about the price; wouldn't you like to buy it for $20 more\\"".    Is this Amazon's new business model? they used to be a retailer you could trust."
1,Thank you.
1,"I have had Norton for quite a few years and had no issues. Their support is awesome - I called recently because I couldn't get rid of an annoying software that I thought was a virus and the tech was very friendly, took care of the issue remotely, and showed me how to avoid accidentally downloading that sort of software &#34;add-on&#34; again."
0,"It was a good purchase and it works well for me. However, I do miss Publusher. It came with 2007 and I use it a lot. Therefore, my rating is a 3."
1,"I went with webroot  and some other better rated system 8 thing for a year. After a year of no avg I'm ready to come back to AVG.  My multiple computers all run better with avg. And it's a big difference. No blue screens and other BS the others caused. I run it on 7 computers running Win 7 to 8.1. Make sure you follow amazon's download and install, which I initially didn't do. That was my fault, what a pain."
1,This is a great deal online.  I went to the local store to pick this up for my new computer and turned around right away when I saw what they wanted for it.  3 computers for much cheaper than 1 at the store.  Sounds Good
1,"Adobe makes great software. I love making movies, photo-manipulation, and animations. You can do so much more with Adobe's products, too. I've had no problems with their software. I am thoroughly pleased."
0,"Terrible upgrade policy.  Updates cost you an ongoing support license.  I have no problem with that.  They were up front about that and I knew it during the purchase.<br /><br />However the program checks for updates automatically and anytime there is a new version WITHOUT WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LICENSED COPY.  Yes that is right, if you forget and click to apply the update it will download and install and without warning wipe out your licensed version and put you back in a 14 day trial.  You have to go and PAY FOR IT AGAIN!!!<br /><br />This is equivalent to ransom ware.  (charging you money to get your files back)  Terrible practice.<br /><br />If this happens to anyone check your trash folder on your mac.  The old copy is there and thankfully you can get it back.  (no warning about that in the update installer either!)  Just delete the &#34;trial&#34; version they sneakily put in it's place and copy your old version back to your applications folder.<br /><br />Other than that the program works.  I'll give it three stars just because it runs the one program I need it to (QuickLoad reloading software).  Just be careful and TURN OFF checking for updates if you don't need them.  If the program you want to run under CrossOver works, there really isn't any need for updates."
1,not too familiar with antivirus software but seems to be doing its job. no new problems with computer since I purchased this
1,"just as expected, use every year, no problems, quite helpful, too bad the federal tax code could not be overhauled and simplified."
1,"Completed my Taxes, worked well."
1,"it does all the work for you, lets you know what was done, takes the guess work out  I love it"
1,I have been using this product for the past 15 years to file my returns. I trust it for accurate processing of my tax returns every year.
1,great price ...works just fine...
0,They did not have their act together this year! That had to stop processing State returns for a couple days and then they mislabeled the software this year so you had to buy two packages.
1,does exactly what I need it to.
1,Works as advertised
1,"I like the credit report and number, the Portfolio X-ray feature, and a few other enhancements. Conversion of 2014 Quicken data was seamless. Been using Quicken since it came out. Very satisfied."
0,junk when compared with S&T.<br />bought it as a replacement for the now deceased Streets & Trips<br />will not sort best route<br />waste of time and money for my purposes
1,Better Quicken than I expected. Quicken seems to always over promise and under deliver. This product does seem to be sound enough to handle the current financial fundamentals and integrated with mobile and internet access to a base line of comparable products. Quicken still holds out for updates and integration forthcoming...which could leave us still waiting for the best product for this market to produced by Intuit. They have promising the &#34;best&#34; since before the 2007 version for Mac. Overall a good product and workable to date.
1,"Amazing product. I've used kaspersky the entire time and will never go elsewhere. Love it, great protection"
1,"I've tried lots of antivirus programs (paid and free) over the last ten years. At this point in time (2013 - 2014) the clear choice is Avast! free... It's easy to install, doesn't present you with too much techno jargon to configure, and plays nice with your system...<br /><br />Avast! Free DOES:<br />- provide good protection to your computer<br />- have simple and clear language to help the majority of users<br />- play well with most software<br /><br />It does NOT:<br />- choke your machine<br />- constantly display confusing messages<br />- lock into your system so tightly you can't switch if you need to<br /><br />This is the a/v I recommend to technical and non-technical family and friends at now - and based on the direction of the company over the past few years I hope it will continue to be my preferred protection"
0,"I tried windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3--three times. Each time I was happy for a few days and then discovered some problems and bugs that can't be fixed and that I cannot live with and decided that I have to roll back to win8.1. I do like the new system, and the idea of tablet and laptop mode, especially for a hybrid device, but at this stage it's simply too many bugs and I would suggest those on the fence that you wait for a while until everything is stabled. Here is a short list of pros and cons about win10:<br /><br />Pros: The UI is more sleek, and more desktop-friendly. Virtual desktop feature is nice. The message center with all menu options resembles that of an Android phone, which is pretty handy. Switch between tablet and desktop mode is also a good feature that lets you decide which world you want to be in. The start menu and Cortana search are especially handy if you get used to it.<br /><br />Cons: OneNote in windows 10 is HORRIBLE. It is no longer simple and straight-forward to use. The little rounded panel for stroke and color is gone. The UI is now completely the same as the desktop program, which is the same design as word, excel, etc. So the panel, plus the taskbar which you cannot hide, take up a lot of screen space. All I wanted is just a plain old college ruled notebook page in front of me, not so many settings that I never use. Also, OneNote crashes a lot more than in win8.1. Sync is slow. I am not sure if it's the server or win10 though.  Other than OneNote, there are also lots of bugs such as office or windows activation. Some other apps didn't work at the first place as well, such as the best known windows companion Drawboard PDF. After seeing two of my most heavily used apps struggle under win10, I say enough is enough, I am going back to win8.1."
0,After upgrading from Quicken 2010 to the 2011 version I experienced unconnectivity to Bank of America. I use BOA for most of my financial needs. After reading various blogs i learned that BOA would not support Quicken 2011 until 2011. In the mean time I had to remove Quickin 2011 and reinstall the 2010 version. Luck for my I backed up all my data. Hopefully in 2011 BOA will support Quicken 2011 and I will give it a try.
1,I have used Norton products for quite awhile now and never had a problem. There customer service is always available and very helpful.
1,"So far this product has worked very well, especially for the price. Fair warning, it will eat up a lot of processing/memory so it's a good idea to keep as much as you can closed while using it. You do have to download many of the extra features on a rather slow server, but other than that you can't beat the performance for the price."
0,"Downloaded this on a whim, Once I got it installed and playing the slides would be out of order and would get out of sinc with the audio. I gave up on it quickly, so maybe some one else could put more time into making it work right."
0,"It is good, sometimes it tells me there is error , I have to update by my self. also not easy to down load and install ."
1,Purchased this after a recommendation from a colleague and I'm loving it. Works great for my blurays and DVDs. Been rewatching all of my favorite movies and it's a whole new experience.
1,"Very good except it is not easy to sync with the bank.  The \\""button\\"" on the screen to do so is not in a logical place, nor is its icon intuitive."
0,"Not as simple as Turbotax, but works.  I couldn't get the deductions to work well nor does it provide proper direction on deductions or counting losses on property."
0,Fast download but don't like this anti-virus product takes too long to to scan my computer and makes it slow. i wish i could get a refund but i don't think i can
1,good price no problems downloading or installing
1,Ok
1,Works on a 2in1 but not as nice as Sygic
0,Manga Studio 5 EX or Autodesk Sketchbook Pro work almost the same but w/no subscription. Manga Studio 5 EX is only $209.99.<br />Download the trial version and you will see it is superior to Photoshop in most features. Sketchbook even has a free version. It is time we as consumers stop these large corps from stepping on us.  Stay with CS6 and start moving to alternatives.  I've seen other companies in the past treat their customers badly when they were on top. Now they are gone or barely a player in the industry.  It is time to take arrogant Adobe down a notch or more.
1,"This is my second year using H&R Block, after switchng from Turbo Tax.  The software was easy to download and use and was very inexpensive for what you get.  I also liked that it only asked me if I wanted to upgrade once, unlike TT, which in the past would do this over and over.     I had one glitch, when my old, clunky computer got hung up and somehow corrupted the file, forcing me to start over, but I'll give H&R Block the benefit of the doubt on that and blame my old desktop.    It was a bit tricky to find the key code for the free e-file.  The prompt said that it was in an email, but it was actually in my Amazon download center.  Once I found it, it worked fine, and I received free e-files for both Federal and State."
1,"I've been using Ibank 5 for about a month now and couldn't be happier.  I imported 8 years of data from Quicken into Ibank and it was effortless.  It took me a couple of weeks to get used to the program and how certain things worked.  I made a couple of phone calls to IGG's customer service and they were always very responsive and helpful.  The budget feature was very important to me and it works quite well. Yes, making a budget is a bit easier in Quicken, the interface is better, but, again once I worked it out I find it is now quite easy to adjust or modify the budget if need be.  Updating my various investment accounts has also proven to work quite well.  I have to say I really don't understand all the negative reviews.  If you are thinking of making the transition over from Quicken, don't hesitate, download the trial version and give it a try.  I actually bought the program directly from IGG, they say they have a 90 day money back guarantee.  I'm so happy I made the switch and can now use just one laptop and finally say goodbye to Quicken!"
1,"The price was right on this product and the product is right for all of the average American families....<br /><br />H&R Block software makes doing your taxes a breeze....<br /><br />The BIG plus is the HUGH savings over going to a tax preparation company.....<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it....."
0,"I ordered this in a hurry and had intended to switch from Microsoft Money to \\""Quicken\\"" but clicked on \\""QuickBooks\\"".  I was VERY disappointed in the features for a normal person.  They lacked numerous qualities that anybody doing accounting would use.  I ended up buying quicken and after installing the program and seeing the significant difference between QuickBooks (simple start) and quicken 2010, I can't imagine ANYBODY using the simple start.      As a side note, Simple Start IS a business oriented program, but many basic features were lacking.  Upgrade to the next level if you need to track customers and billing.  I doubt this program will meet your needs.    Corey  (Former small business owner)"
0,"This product does not work well with Windows,Microsoft word, and Firefox because it causes the flash player to crash. When I contacted nuance their reply was it was not their product and at this time there is no patch being developed to correct this problem.<br />I had to go back to using Dragon Naturally Speaking home 12.1 after buying the 13.0 from Amazon, which I would like to add that it is not Amazon's fault but it is the fault of the manufacturer.<br />Nuance is an extremely difficult company to deal with and they seem to be having problems with all of their new software programs according to their blog that people are logging in on.<br />I would advise you to not purchase this product until nuance can come up with some kind of a patch to make it work with the Adobe flash player."
0,"I initially put a Misc Income for my wife as some type of Business Income. Turbo Tax would not let me edit or delete it. The program kept on asking me to choose one of four forms that I received or sent to the IRS for it. No matter what I did, I could not change the entry. I spent over 1 and 1/2 hours trying to edit it but could not. I finally gave up and chose one of the four choices of &#34;forms&#34; that I had no idea what they were just to get out and submit my return. Never again with Turbo Tax."
0,"Along with some usual stocks in companies, I bought some stocks in a Royalty Trust.  These are investments in things like oil, natural gas, coal, precious metals, real estate, etc.  The goal with these stocks is not usually to buy low and sell high.  The goal is to collect dividends.<br /><br />Dividends from this Royalty Trust are reported by my broker on a 1099-MISC.  This Royalty Trust (and I'm new to this, so I don't know if they all do this) also provides some additional information on costs associated with the stocks.  They also provide information on how to file this information with the IRS and reduce the tax burden, since you don't actually get this money, so it's not really income.<br /><br />But H&R Block 2014 Deluxe edition does not ask for any of that extra information.  As far as I can tell, if I had not noticed this, it would have cost me a significant amount on my taxes.<br /><br />I contacted customer support, and they eventually verified that the interview does not support this, and that I have to manually enter the information on the proper forms myself.<br /><br />Again, if I had not noticed this, this software would have cost me money.  So 2 stars."
1,Good buy
0,"Mistake to get this- I meant to get Kaspersky Internet Security for 3 computers, which can be found for about the same price."
0,"Not user friendly, and extremely inaccurate with balances when using reminders, compared to Quicken for Windows 2013!"
0,"Not many choices for Mac in this category. Performance is slow. Interface seems blocky. Seems to get everything done that I need, though."
1,"Needed to make safety sheets for OSHA compliance. Was able to convert PDF to word to use my companies header; fast, simple. Enough said."
1,Great program.  Especially the feature that allows app for tablets.  Now I can organize photos to show on my tablet from the program on my computer.  Photoshop has a lot of features.  It does a nice job touching up photos.  I haven't had time to use the Elements Premiere for videos yet but I am sure after using Photoshop for photos that I will be very satisfied with videos also.
1,This version of Avast has proven to be all I need for my very basic Internet needs and usage. Avast prompts me when I need updates and offers advanced versions if one would like to upgrade. An enthusiastic thumbs up.
1,Best thing going. Does not slow your computer down.  Web site safety monitoring and frequent automatic updates are big pluses. There's a mobile version for Android devices - a must have.
1,Needed Notron Security for a computer with lots of stuff going on.  It has worked well.  I have other computers that I will be adding it too.
1,"Awsome progranm, tunes up your system by getting rid of uneeded files and speeds up your system.  If you have a slow system I highly recommend this program"
1,"Software found deductions, credits, and other tax savings I may have missed on my own. Download version was cheaper and more convenient to obtain than boxed version. My only complaint is that I thought this version came with one free state filing, which it did not."
0,It met my expectations
1,"Great tax program, asked all the right questions and did all the calculations. I got it after I had filled my taxes to see if it came up with the same figures and it did."
1,I've had avast! as my antivirus program for many years; always worked; always protected; always free. What more can you ask?
0,"Problem is, you should've made it like the Apple Cloud and the Google Cloud, instead it's just a link to the web site, instead of a synced folder on the computer :("
0,"The previous Amazon Cloud Drive desktop application (circa 2012) while clunky was useful, providing offline access to files and automatic background sync on par with other services like Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Then for some unfathomable reason that app was pulled and replaced by a new &#34;desktop&#34; app which is just a drag and drop interface for upload and a button for download... a GIANT STEP BACKWARDS. I felt the service has great promise and the $59.99 for all you can use is compelling - except due to the prehistoric nature of the desktop app, this storage solution at least for me is not a very useful daily solution. It's lack of features put is more on par with an archiving services like Carbonite and Backblaze and not a cloud file management solution."
1,"I had no problems installing or running the application. Other than TT sometimes has a quirky interface where you don't see what's coming next to know if you missed it or is coming up, it works the same as always.  Installed on XP SP3.    I had no problems with the Amazon installer. Those who are wondering where the downloaded file went, Right-Click the Amazon Downloader icon in your system tray, and select \\""Open Download Folder\\"". It defaults to \\""All Users\\"", not your username.    5/5 because the software works, and this is a review of the software, not Amazon.  I don't like proprietary downloaders I have to install, but that's a different review.    Done. with 2 days to spare."
1,This is my 4th year with PC Matic.  I highly recommend it.  I have not had any problems and it runs scans regularly on schedule without any thought on my part..
0,"Where and how do I contact tech support for this app?  Also, why does it cost 4X as much for Windows as it does the Mac?<br /><br />I already bought this for Mac, and I am trying to run it on my Windows partition (on the same computer). How can I do that?  Do I really have to buy it again?"
0,"this software protection works constantly, seems to work very good; easy to install, no need to monitor, just set and forget."
1,I have been working on my PC with email or internet and Avast would notify me that it had prevented a virus in what I was doing. That is fantastic and Avast runs in background without a lot of resources.  Really like Avast thanks..
0,"i can´t download this software, why?"
1,Cheap way to renew Norton.
0,I spent countless hours on the phone with quickbooks help line trying to figure out how to do what I needed to do and twice they were completely unable to help me.  I then spent another 6 hours on my own and finally figured it out.  Now that I can work it how I need to work it it's great but the help line was not helpful and it was not totally user friendly.  But it works and I wouldn't change it.
1,It seems to be good. Still working with it and learning.
1,"When you update something like this, you don't expect much except updated maps. The maps seem to have a lot of updates. I usually buy this every other year, not sure why they don't do a subscription. I skipped a few years, but noticed a lot of new roads not listed.<br />The new colors of the interface doesn't feel like an upgrade, but like something they would have had in the 2000 Version.<br />I have had the same issue other have had that it won't drag the route, or place a waypoint where I clicked on the screen. This has been a great function, and worked perfectly since I have used S&T back to the 1990's. I have found I can use the Arrow Keys to nudge the point to where I want it.<br />I think it is about time they add a &#34;scenic&#34; to the route options, others have it available.<br /><br />If you are along the lines of S & T 2010 and earlier, I would upgrade. If not, wait another year or two."
1,"Lots of great features, user friendly."
1,Good experience will order again
1,It works as advertised and fairly priced.
0,"Thanks to everyone for the reviews. I was about to purchase Quickbooks Pro 2011 when I read all the reviews. Is it me, or is everyone looking for what the website offers for the money. If we are to be charged extra for attachments, e-mails, or other information then, the website should say so for that price. Why not include everything for one price.(Too easy) The website mis-leads letting you think that you get everything listed for the price listed.    Postive: Quickbooks offers everything to make keeping up with my business more manageable.     I have a small business and keying in another application for time managment is more cost effective for my growing business. The finacial part for my business is free at MINT.com    Thanks Everyone,  Shame on Quickbooks Pro"
1,"This made doing my taxes easy (well, if it can ever really be easy -- if it were, who would need software!)  You still have to do the background work but not as much as doing it manually, especially IF you are willing to use real account numbers and ID's to allow access to your private information.  If you do, I suggest using an extremely secure device and Internet connection.  It can even be used an automated calculating machine if you want to enter everything manually and have it just fill in the blanks and do the arithmetic for you.  It even does the worksheets.  Put this on your list for next year if you are often late getting to your taxes, and it saves big bucks from paying a tax preparer."
0,"Worthless. Won't even launch. Stops when it gets to &#34;Initializing DirectX plug-ins. Have tried 3 times now, not bothering with a 4th."
1,So did I.  But it took me less than 2 hours to do the taxes and I did save on an accountant.  I've used Turbo Tax for the last five years in conjunction with Quicken and it's a great time saver.
1,"I've been using Mint for a few years, and love it, but have wanted to give Quicken a try. I've been awaiting a new release because Essentials didn't have the features I was looking for, so I was happy to see this version released! So far it's perfect for what I need it for, and I love that I'll be getting updates with additional features in the upcoming months! I voted for my favorites (bill pay and a bill calendar) on the website, so hoping to see those soon!"
0,"Quicken completely screwed up my transfer from 2007 to 2014: eliminated categories; added multiple accounts each time I opened and could not get rid of them except by hiding them each time, only to be reopened again. Put account information for one account in all the accounts. And then ... erased all my updated information. Support is only by chat by representatives who do not have any idea of the program and do not know what they are doing. And ... THERE IS NO PHONE SUPPORT.  DO NOT USE THIS HORRIBLE UPGRADE!"
0,"The 2009 version has returned an unacceptable number of failures since being installed. In one example, the low energy vehicle tax credit function failed to allow addition of my qualified automobile. During my first update, TurboTax locked up requiring a system reboot, software removal, and reinstallation. In another update, TurboTax automatically added software for my state of residence in 2008; I intended to manually download a module for my current state of residence.  Tech Service - witless.  My confidence in TT is gone, and so is the software. (Addendum: The IRS recently identified a TurboTax-caused [doubling] blunder in my amended 2007 return resulting in a $1500 refund)."

1,very easy to download using amazon. No problems at all. Worked with my past years of turbo tax I bought from there website.
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax since the 90's and it has always been a good product.  This year, 2013 was the smoothest yet where it really cut my time to do my taxes and do it accurately way down."
1,"I had used Sketchbook Pro before and loved it. Sketchbook Pro 6 is a better version of an already great program. The DL was fast, simple and issue free. At $19.95, it was an absolute steal!"
0,the user guide only tell you what things are but not how to use them.. its ok as a word processor but really disappointed that i cant fully use this program because i lack the know how.

1,Easy to download. Waiting for uprgrade in January to do taxes.
1,Norton Virus Protection is perfect for me.  It was a very easy download and is constantly working in the background.
0,So far purchasing this POS has caused Internet Explorer to blow its brains out. Don't know if it is Amazon (recent services suck) or Kapersky - services always suck. I press on
0,"I just finished my taxes.  Using H&R Block it said I owned $1400 to federal.  I knew this wasn't correct, as nothing major has changed since last years, so I used Turbotax.  I received a 2280 refund from federal.  H&R Block what a joke."
1,"This is my favorite antivirus for years. Hav not had an issue that needed to deal with their tech support. It is always there and working, protecting, and not intrusive."
0,Forget about contacting them when there is a bug.  Customer Service is horrible.  I spent over an hour with online chat trying to get someone to even understand that the auto-reconcile feature doesn't work correctly  for some credit card accounts (search online for similar posts by others).  I have been using Quicken for over 20 years and I really know how to use this software.  They treated me like I was an idiot.  They were no help.  Their answer was just NOT to use the auto-reconcile feature.  Imagine that!  This is my last Intuit program I will ever purchase.
1,Very good anti malware software that works well side by side with other anti virus software
0,"The QuickBook Pro updates have always caused the same glitches time and time again, BUT, this current version is the worst!! We were forced to upgrade to 2014 in May as QB would no longer support bank payments without the upgrade. Since that time, we have had no more than one month combined (over the last 7 months) of smooth functioning of this software. We no sooner get it working than it freezes up again--always with the same problem, sending payments freezes up the program making it non-responsive with the only option to force the program to close. Then we are back to spending hour upon hour on the phone trying to get it fixed. One department will send my office manager to another, only to be sent right back to the same department again. My office manager will inform the tech support rep that there are multiple case numbers to refer to and asks them to read those first to save time but they insist upon going through their script each time she has to call. I am not exaggerating when I say this upgrade has cost my business well over $1,000 in down time spent on the phone trying to get the program functioning. This doesn't include all of the time I've personally spent correcting entries or late fees incurred while trying to get payments sent out to vendors. To add further insult to injury, QB informed us that we would either have to pay them several hundred $$ to fix our problem or sign up for their tech support plan. It took over an hour on hold to get those charges waived and then another 48 hours for them to fix it. This simply is unacceptable and inexcusable. If I put out a product of this poor of quality I would quickly go out of business--and rightly so!<br /><br />Since May, the customer service ppl have advised us several times to change to the subscription based application versus the desktop software. HOWEVER, we run several company files--5 actually--out of this office which means we would have to pay for 5 subscriptions!!! So, now I'm going to be forcedto pay Intuit for yet another solution simply to have a functioning accounting system? I'm sorry but this just doesn't make sense, fiscally or logically.<br /><br />I am forced to conclude that Intuit has no interest in satisfying their software based customers with a program that actually works for more than a few days at a time. My office manager has been trying to convince me to try Sage 10 and she just might be getting her wish very soon!"
1,Updated program. Easy to download.
0,"The zip/exe file that was downloaded was faulty. Once &#34;installed&#34; could not create new return. Once you buy it, you have no contact as you have no idea who seller REALLY is.<br /><br />H&R Block saved the day by sending me a working package. [Rumor has it that Deluxe+ does not play nice with XP]<br /><br />Will say it took 3-4 days to get this sorted out: there were a LOT of faulty download packages tried."
0,I still find that the Adobe team is still at work and have not simplified the use of this product.
1,Its very good
0,"I read a few of the reviews; Yes I agree with the frustration that there is really still no other game in town, that is why I give it a 3.<br /><br />However - The download from AMazon went smoothly, and I immediately upgraded to latest release (thanks for others who commented on additional bug fixes); still - I really only use &#34;transaction&#34; management - not really using the investment capabilities except for downloading details - which is basically why I had to upgrade &#34;on demand&#34; because they said today is last day to upgrade.<br /><br />Conversion of existing files went ok - 2/3 immediately went through conversion; 3rd said file was already open, but managed to get it going the 2nd time I attempted"
1,I have used Avast for many years and it is simple and effective. You wont be disappointed with Avast products.
0,"The &#34;Help&#34; pull-down menu says, &#34;In the new task window, click the Music Disc option and then select the type of music disc you want to create (Audio CD, WMA CD, MP3 CD, WMA DVD, MP3 DVD). The Music Disc window displays.&#34;<br /><br />This is BS. There is no music disc option ... anywhere. Their website says to do the same thing, but it shows a different screen than the one on the program I received. This is a pig in a poke. Stay away from it."
1,Everything seems to be working fine. I like the fact that I can see all occurences for the next 12 months.
1,I guess it did exactly what it said it was going to do.  I entered the code in Microsoft Windows Anytime Upgrade center and after a little bit I had Windows Professional.
0,Too expensive.
0,"Horribly rigid software, does not allow any type of flexibility to adjust to what you need. This software sucked for property management type of business. Quicken from 10 years ago was better than this. Furthermore, I tried returning it since Intuit has 60 day satisfaction guarantee, no one has responded after 4 attempts to return."
1,This product continues to provide the functionality that I need year after year.
1,Been using Quicken for quite a few years. I update annually for tax estimating purposes and budgeting. This version gets the job done.
1,I give this product Five Stars because I have used it many times before and it is reliable and I can count on getting the most out of the  help that ensures my full refund.  If there any new updates they are provided and anything that changes with the IRS is in the program.  It is easy and easy to follow with its walk through steps.  I love it.  I would and have recommended others to purchase this product because it's accurate and you can feel at ease knowing you have done your taxes right; all you have to do is put the correct information on the forms it calculate and works it out for you.  It's Easy.
1,"Diversification is essential in this new world economy and it is very important for my company to be able to communicate the many different facets of service to the public without writing a book that nobody will read anyway. Microsoft Publisher allows me to target my clientele without unnecessary information or the added cost of a printing company selling me thousands of the same advertisements. With just a few words on the topic I choose I can create a very effective, informative brochure or flier<br />at a fraction of the cost of the printing press. Thank you Microsoft."
0,download wouldn't work.  it took me hours and many phone calls to resolve.  I would not purchase this way again.
1,"Downloading to multiple destinations (HDD, USB flash drive etc.)  for taking care of 5 e-files was easy. Software download from Amazon library is a cinch!"
1,"It is what it is. Ain't nothing better for working on photos, unless you use the CS series of PhotoShop (which I do)."
1,"Been using Avast for years, Simply the best there is.  Used others and then removed them and installed Avast, Found problems that the others never even found.  Never a problem with Avast."
0,"The program is decent, it freezes sometimes and i have to restart it only down fall."
1,Great product will use again
1,"I've been using Norton Internet Security for years now, but instead of renewing my subscription through Symantec for $60 a year, I wait until the download is $20 or so sometime during the year and just &#34;sit&#34; on the product key and update it when it's time. If you renew a few days ahead of time, it doesn't add your remaining days to the subscription, but instead just resets the clock at 366 days. Norton customer support is always happy to add those missing days back to your subscription, but you have to contact them through their webpage to do so.<br /><br />NIS has always kept my 3 computers safe and sound, and it feels good knowing they're well protected."
1,"I think this app is great!  Simple to use, organizes all your passwords by category, and offers a premium cloud backup service if you so choose!  I recommend it to all my customers."
0,"Bought this thinking it was for a year of service but it was not.Who pay's $20 dollor's a month for internet security that's $240 a year.my laptop cost about $400,i try'd contacting them and got no where's.I guess it was a good thing because every 30 min something pop's up from norton on my computer screen.so after uninstalling it-i still cant get rid of their hot key or something like that,not to computer nifty."
0,THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SOFTWEAR PROGRAM THAT SHOWS YOU HOW TO WRITE SHORT STORIES BUT ALL THIS IS A TRAP TO GET PARENTS TO BUY MORE SOFTWEAR FOR THE KIDS. PLUS EVERY TIME I TRY TO LOOK AT THE WRITING SOFTWEAR IT TAKES ME TO THE AMAZON WEBPAGE TO BUY THE SOFTWEAR AGAIN THIS IS TOTAL BS<br />I JUST LOST 4.95 I SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON AMAZON FOR YEARS A THIS TIME I LOST BIG TIME.
1,Thank you for a good sense of security---
1,Excellent!!!!. The best to do your taxes!!!!
1,"The software did exactly what I needed it to: helped me do my taxes and answered questions I had along the way. I have a sole-proprietor business, so I had to do more than a simple 1040EZ."
0,"It would probably be a good release if it didn't crash doing One Step Updates. The issue has been around for weeks without resolution, and no way to go back to the previous version."
1,No problems with this at all! Installed easy from the website. Simply follow the directions and everything went well. This replaced an expired McAfee Internet Security so the software removed the old and put the new on. I didn't have to do that. Very simple to use.
1,This software has helped me completely reorganize my workflow and estimating- and access to estimates and invoice while in the field... preventing me from waiting to return to my office to get documents to my clients!
1,"I can use my office pc, or my home pc or my smart phone to keep work lists and todo lists and buy lists.  They are all synchronized on the cloud.  It's awsome !!!"
0,loaded and soon after stopped working
1,"Don't know what I'd do without it. SO easy to use, and LOTS of special capture features. I'll use it until I turn back to dust!"
0,Well I think is screwed up my personal return as I didn't see any self-employment tax although I submitted  K-1 income.  I had to upgrade to a $30 more expensive program which only added a schedule e and left out the SE form.  I am waiting for the feds to contact me.  Turbotax is a racket that throws you into premium products and lures you in with the cheaper ones.  I hate this.  I felt scammed in the end
1,Avast provides an excellent product with continuous updates to keep it working perfectly. No complaints. Would recommend its use to anyone.
0,"There is a bug in X4 (x3 doesn't have it) where it will not save the alpha channel properly.  I've spent 3 weeks writing back and forth to \\""customer service\\"".  Only to be told that TGA files won't save an alpha channel. Where do they get customer support people?<br /><br />If you're going to be saving TGA files or playing with transparency - get version x3."
1,This version has greater ease in changing the table views.  The update link to my bank is faster.  I love not having to save every item when it is changed.  One minor issue that the update from my bank files sometimes does not have the full item name.  I highly recommend getting this version.
0,"I do not like,several problems to install."
0,"The investment performance calculations in IBank were for me hopelessly inadequate with respect to calculating returns only offering a percentage increase on a security . After using MS Money for many years I was used to multiple types of return calculations.<br />The input process via importing with .QIF files was pretty seamless so no complaints there. I found the format of the reports too unwieldy ,again after being used to the many options for customisation in MS Money. All in all after toiling away at trying to make it do something more than the most basic accounts/investment profiles I gave up frustrated. Fortunately i remembered reading about Moneydance and found the holy grail I was looking for, with its extremely informative user manuals and extensively tweakable reporting and input editing system. Moneydance doesn't \\""look\\"" as good as IBANK but it definitely is light years ahead of it in functionality."
1,This app is great and so is our Constitution as long as King Obama doesn't change it.
0,I'm not happy that they started charging for the e-file for the state return. Last year they did not charge for it. So Screw you H&R block for bending me over and trying to screw me out of more money for your crappy software that sometimes works but at the same time doesn't work.
1,"I have tried a number of video capture and converter products, and the Movavi product line is excellent.  They work just as they are advertised, and they are easy to use.  And the quality of the output is great."
0,"I bought downloaded version of TaxCut. It turned out that I had to install Amazon downloader I try to keep my computer clean and avoid unnecessary software installation. Amazon should have offered to their customers a way to purchase files without forcing them to install any additional programs. Any installed program contaminates system with registry entries, libraries and files. It makes computers slow and more vulnerable to hackers. Beside this Amazon's downloader tends to stay in RAM, consuming computer resources. Amazon should reconsider way they sell files from their store."
1,"I hadn't use McAfee in years as they weren't getting good reviews but gave them a try again as they were getting good reviews now and the price was right. Easy install, setup and seems to be working fine. Does not slow down my Win 7 pro T420s. Can't complain."
1,Great software for years in a row! Have not used anything but Turbo Tax. Downloaded it too! Never had to spend any gas or time to go the store - awesome!
1,"Was having problems with shared printers on the network since I upgraded my main desktop to Win 7 Home Premium 64.  After searching the net, found the answer:  Upgrade to Win 7 Pro.  Hmmmm.   Checked around and, sure enough, that was the recommendation in more than one site.    So I purchased the upgrade key, downloaded it, into my system and now I'm Pro and the printers now stay set as they should have with Home Premium.   Glad to have it fixed, so thank you Amazon; but, MS, it never should have been a problem to begin with.  Go figure.  Allen"
0,Errors in data transfer. I found this to be strange. Clearing them up took a while. Older versions seemed to transfer more cleanly.
0,Even more buggy than Movie Studio 11.  Spent hours creating a video only to have it constantly lock up my machine after a minutes worth of video.  Tried it on two separate computers with same result.  Absolutely horrible!
1,good
1,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Love My Norton♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
0,"I'm using TurboTax for the first time. So far it seems like a straight forward interface, but the pricing structure really turns me off. I read all the product reviews that warned about the pricing gimmicks when e-filing state taxes, and was prepared for the $20 e-filing fee or using the print/snail mail option. However, no warning about the extra $40 charge for downloading a second state!! That's like buying this product twice. If you've earned income in more than one state, or like me, are a student and maintain residency in another state, be warned!"
1,Pretty easy to use. No issues.
1,"It work so good in a 1 Gb netbook LENOVO, the perfomance of the netbook is so good and the price is low..."
0,"Used the 2011 version last year, and purchased this year's 2012 deluxe.  It won't update.  Tried numerous times: uninstalled, reinstalled, installed in different directory, installed under different users etc.  - nothing works, won't update ever.  And now it won't uninstall either.  I bought TaxACT 2012 and used that instead.  I thought TurboTax was ridiculous, now HR Block At Home is lousy too.  And I see other people with the same problem here, but no fix, update, workaround posted by HR Block."
1,This has become one of my favorite pieces of software. I truly love how it handles YouTube. All of my Blu-Ray movies play without problems.
0,"I have been using TurboTax since 1997 and have never had so many problems as this year.  I started out simply wanting to purchase this year's version on their primary website.  To do so, they con you into starting on online return with the premise that its free or will eventually take you to a purchase selection screen....nope.  No instructions on how to simply buy the software, poor clarity of purpose on their primary site and no way to back out or delete the return that you start on line.  From there it went downhill badly.  Every time I needed to interface their software with the internet I had to call the help desk and wait 2 hours on their helpdesk....2+ hours to upgrade to Premium, 2 hours to download the state and now the same issues with Efiling.  Too bad Intuit, you have really lost your way and a good loyal customer....or thousands based on these reviews.  I'll do you a favor in return, you can adjust next years sales forecast by lowering by -1!."
0,"Forewarned by abysmal ratings on Amazon, but optimistic that by now (December 30, 2013) Quicken Premier (QP) 2014 would be functioning properly, I downloaded it to a computer which didn't have Quicken on it at all, in case there was trouble. I've been a Quicken User since 1993, and have upgraded every year. QP 2013 was the worst version before 2014 came out, and it took Intuit eight revisions for the 2013 version to get it functioning by the end of 2012 (it's presently had 12 revisions). QP 2014's debut seems to have set a new low in both competence and professionalism.<br /><br />Two days ago (a Saturday), figuring that surely after getting feedback and having some Intuit ghost, &#34;Kathryn,&#34; putting canned messages on the hundreds of complaints about QP 2014 (and other Quicken 2014 software) that things were fixed, or would be forwarded to something called a &#34;development team&#34; (a development team? Now? Why not have a development team before the product was released to an unsuspecting public?), I downloaded it and found that it updated itself to Revision 5 and converted my QP 2013 files--an unfortunate habit Quicken has of making it as difficult and inconvenient as possible by seeing to it that prior versions won't work with data files of succeeding versions.<br /><br />When conversion was complete, the first thing I noticed was that the toolbar only had four or five of the functions I had set up in QP 2013. I had added a number of specialized reports I designed for doing taxes, and none were on the toolbar. Neither was the calendar icon there, which I found particularly baffling. There were no alerts indicated, and when I called up the calendar by alternate means, I found that not a single item was on it. It was blank through the end of 2014, despite my QP 2013 calendar being full of dates for medical appointments, birthdays, anniversaries, tax events, and other things. There was nothing before 2014 either, leaving me with no references for future orpast occasions and activities. QP 2014 apparently ignored what was in my QP 2013 version calendar.<br /><br />Next, I downloaded transactions for my checking account and two credit cards. The download seemed to be going all right, but when it finished, I was aghast. My checking account had mushroomed to $63,000 (would that I did indeed have that kind of balance!), and there was a message saying that &#34;my bank&#34; had told Quicken that there were more transactions, but they were unavailable because I had waited so long to update. As a matter of fact, I reconcile my accounts nearly every day, and all had been reconciled just the day before. Hundreds of transactions downloaded to my checking account, none with categories, even though all my transactions were recorded, with categories, in QP 2013. The two credit card accounts were much the same. Transactions up the ying-yang, no categories, and incorrect balances.<br /><br />I have little doubt that there were other things that weren't correct, but at that point, I'd had enough. I was not about to amuse a bunch of Intuit programming clerks by researching and correcting their incomplete, inaccurate, and invalid financial transactions, nor was I going to re-enter everything into the blank calendar for both future and past years, nor was I going to hunt for other possible errors and dysfunction. They may not think my time is valuable, but I do. I don't know how such DNA gets into the human gene pool to pollute it in the first place, or why anyone would want to hire it, but whoever is responsible for this thing that's called a 2014 financial management program should be dealt with. I dealt with them by removing QP 2014 from the computer to which I had downloaded it, and went back to QP 2013, which was on my other computer (and which still worked, mercifully enough!).<br /><br />I intend to get my money back from Intuit (I had purchased it from them through a special offer linked to their current TurboTax program, whichI use each year; the price was less than Amazon's). I might share with fellow QP 2014 purchasers though that even getting a refund shows an incompetence and unprofessionalism almost without parallel, in my experience. When I went back to my account and called up my order, there was a &#34;refund&#34; box,&#34; but I couldn't put a checkmark in it. A message said to call Intuit, which I did this (Monday) morning, as soon as they opened. I got a rather snippy robo-voice when I selected the &#34;for Quicken press three,&#34; telling me to go to a website, get a telephone number, and call that. What a bunch of nincompoops!<br /><br />Okay, I went to the website, and never did find other numbers to call. I'm happy to report that, after a lot of experimenting with un-&#34;intuit&#34;-ive screens, I finally was able to find a place, well-hidden, it seemed, to request a refund. I clicked &#34;submit,&#34; and was told that I'd receive an e-mail. I did receive one promptly, but it said that I'd recently had a &#34;conversation&#34; with someone, and that the conversation was summarized below. There was nothing summarized below or anywhere else in the e-mail. I have an &#34;incident&#34; number, which suggests that someone things I asked for technical support, and I don't have a clue as to whether Intuit knows I've requested a refund or, if so, when I might request it. Of particular interest, nowhere was I asked why I wanted a refund. Is it possible that they don't want to know? Don't care? Have a failed business model?<br /><br />That's my experience, and I just hope before my three-year period or being able to use QP 2013 is up, a firm which cares about excellence and customers will put out a good financial management software product. Intuit, its Quicken programming clerks, and its management no longer seem to have the will, expertise, or oversight to serve what should be a lucrative market. I imagine that the founder must be spinning in his grave, because when the companywas started, the situation I've described here, and the same or worse situation hundreds of others have shared on Amazon just this year alone, would not have been tolerated. As many people have noted, the Quicken line of products have been stagnating in terms of features and getting worse in terms of capability to even work. One wonders how long this can go on. I'm generally a very loyal customer, by the way, but there are limits.<br /><br />A final note, if I might. I read every one of the then-562 ratings of QP 2014 before trying the download, along with every comment on every rating. I noticed several four- and five-star ratings which had no justification for them other than some vague murmurings to the effect that &#34;Quicken is great.&#34; In many of those instances, that was the only rating the person had ever given on Amazon, or one of two ratings. That, and a recent news program reporting that people were being paid to put in phony ratings for products to increase the averages (Intuit wasn't mentioned in the program), made me wonder whether all the high ratings of QP 2014 (relatively few that there are) were completely honest. I think it's clear that the great bulk of customers who have rated QP 2014 are nowhere near happy.<br /><br />Others have raised the issue. If they're right, as I suspect they may be, the &#34;real&#34; average rating for QP 2014 may well be closer to two stars at this point--maybe less. Of course, some people may well have had a fabulous experience with the program, and truly believe it merits four or five stars. My own experience was the opposite, and I hope that the information I've provided in this review has justified my one-star rating and will be of some assistance to other customers.<br /><br />P.S. Oh--and &#34;Kathryn,&#34; if you even exist, don't bother putting one of your canned comments on my review. Notwithstanding your blatant use of your (or a made-up?) first name, as though you're bosom-buddies with customers, I don't think most of us are fooled<br />for a moment into believing that you're dealing with us out of friendship. Yikes!"
1,"The download was fine.  It's a bit cheaper than getting it from turbotax. Better price could have been obtained from banks and others, though banks give away the online version most often."

But i some remote hidden print...<br />.... oh we will let you prepare and print the state, but if you want to efile 20 bucks please, want that taken out your refund instead of a credit card, that will be another 40 bucks!.<br />If i could get my $ back i will so send this stupid software right back from where it came."
0,"Ever since I installed that, and it took two tries to do it. My computer has not been working right. I can get no support help and I finally had to revert to a system back up which removed it. I'm hoping after I get some tech help from a store here that I can put it back on. I do NOT like being forced to download software. I prefer a disk.<br /><br />B"
0,"I have used Quicken for 16 years and I have upgraded faithfully each of those years.  This version is the worst.  It says I have insufficient resources, which is light years from accurate.  I called the support line three times and spent a total of 2 1/2 hours on hold and was cut off each time.  I then went for a chat session.  I humored the script-reader from India through a grueling course of attempts to fix it.  After all his/her instructions failed, the next step was to turn the case over to the research team.  That is when I called a halt to the party and I have now entered an order for a refund.  I restored v 2013 and am back up and running.  The old computer nerd axiom appears to be true:  Avoid even-numbered upgrades."
0,"Quicken 2014 sucks! I have used Quicken for over 10 years, but when I &#34;upgraded&#34; to 2014 it crashed within 2 weeks. Every time I tried to enter a transaction in my Checking account it crashed! After 2 sessions with gentlemen from India at the Intuit un-help desk, I uninstalled 2014 and went back to 2013. Of course, then I had to spend 3 hours updating all the transactions that had occurred in the meantime. What a hassle! No word from Intuit on when or if they will fix this bug. Don't buy it!"
1,Every editor should have Video Editor by Wondershare. It is offers an interesting set of effects you don't get with other software.
1,I have never had a problem with Avast!  It frequently updates to prevent viruses and trojan horses.  It has saved me more than once!
1,I have used Quickbooks for several years and this new Pro version is the best yet.  Very user friendly and easy to imput data.  I highly recommend it for the beginner or the pro!
1,"I do standard deduction every year.  I could've chosen a cheaper tax return program, but I still using this because this makes the whole return process simple and hassle free."
1,"The program is lightweight, quick, has excellent options, and does exactly what I was told it would do. The boot time scan option is probably one of it's best features just because it scans the computer without giving the computer a chance to let the programs with infected files/folders or other infected programs to turn on."
1,"I have been using avast! for 2 years, and I have had no virus problems. Very easy to use, most things run automatically and unobtrusively. The tools and scans are great."
1,"I leaned my new windows 8 computer would not run my old 2003 Quicken.  As instructed, I downloaded 2004 quicken which converted the file so it would be accepted by windows 8.  I had to have some on-line support for this process.  I'm now up and running Quicken Deluxe 013 and it's working perfectly.  I haven't tried any new features so can't comment on them.  All in all - I'm very satisfied."
1,Awesome product! Highly recommend it for users. Very light on system resources.
0,Best overall protection I have found to keep my computer safe. Have used it for many years.
1,"I just wanted to counter the one star reviews for this product. The potential uses of this program are endless in the right hands, but it doesn't do the work for you. It also is not solely for the garden--its for the whole home but the garden stuff is well fleshed out. The tutorial is essential to even understand where to begin, but once you get the hang of it, its a great tool. I'm only learning the basics now, but I look forward to mastery in a relatively short time. It is not a &#34;waste of money&#34; as another reviewer said--its just whats advertised"
1,norton is one of the best antivirus in the business. You get your monies worth and it is very simple to understand.
0,"Do not waste you money on this screensaver.  You cannot put in settings, it sends you to the company web site.  I don't need to pay 10 for ads."
1,Excellent and very helpful software. I like this better than Turbo Tax. I have used this brand successfully for many years.
1,"For Macs running 10.9.4 - please read:<br />We've used Norton Anti Virus for Mac on several machines in our house for years with no problems. This month I purchased it twice and loaded it on two different MacBook Pro's, both running OSX 10.9.4.  I purchased them from Amazon for the best price but I did not download from Amazon. I followed the instructions left by another reviewer which I have copied here. It worked like a charm both times.<br /><br />In addition to these instructions I would add, first I used the Symantec uninstaller found in the Applications folder. Then follow the reviewer's instructions below. Then copy the Product Key found in your Amazon confirmation email. Open Norton AntiVirus (your free trial version) and there will be a button to click to &#34;purchase now&#34;. Then choose the option to use the Product Key you copied and paste it in. It will confirm that your subscription is now good for 366 days.<br /><br />The following is copied from a prior reviewer:<br />Amazon's installer works... only if you're not on OS X 10.9<br />By W. Rezieon May 7, 2014<br />Platform for Display: Mac DownloadVerified Purchase<br />Because of the number of problems folks seem to be running into installing this on Mavericks (10.9), I decided to make a note of this in a review to help out those struggling to install this.<br /><br />First, to figure out what version of OS X you are running, click the apple icon on the top left of your screen, then click on &#34;About this Mac&#34;. A window will pop up, and you should clearly see &#34;Version 10.x.y&#34;. You should generally be able to ignore the y value; instead, pay closer attention to the 10.x portion.<br /><br />*(As Amazon disallows links to non-Amazon pages, I'll try to be as descriptive as possible). If your version is 10.9, Google for &#34;norton antivirus downloads&#34; (without the quotes). Click on the result that directs you to Norton's site, and search through their pages to find the TRIAL version ofNorton Antivirus. The link you want should be within a section of their site under &#34;Other Norton Free Trials&#34;. You then want to click the link that says Norton Antivirus 30-day free trial for Macs. Following that, click the big yellow button to actually begin the download.<br /><br />Once you install that, just plug in your license key and you should have the software activated. Note that you can do this anytime during the trial instead, if you'd like an extra 30 days for free ;)."
1,"One of the best out there.<br /><br />Pros<br />-- Low resource usage, stays out of the way<br />-- Excellent AV<br /><br />Cons<br />-- Noisy!  Just change it to silent mode and then it's fine"
1,I'm still learning all quicken can do but so far I'm pleased.<br />We have a small home based business & it's perfect for our needs. It tracks spending & income for our CPA at tax time.<br />It's worth the investment.
0,"I have been using QuickBooks Pro 2014 for 8 months now.  If I had it to do over, I would not upgrade to 2014.  I used to be able to do my work in QuickBooks while traveling.  I experienced an issue saying my subscription expired.  I don't have a subscription that should expire.  I could not work open my company profile to work on invoicing until I was connected to the internet to resolve the issue.  I lost valuable time.  When I tried to notify a support person, I could not find a number to call.  There is no customer service.  Beware of upgrading to 2014, it has bugs unknown and no customer service to help.  I suggest reading all customer reviews before investing in 2014 and risking some loss of time.  Maybe in a few more months the bugs will be worked out."
1,"I have been using this software for many years and it continues to work well for me, and you can't beat the price"
1,"I got tired of trying to use the TextEdit software that came pre-installed on my iMac.  TextEdit wouldn't let me do simple things like change the margin sizes.  But worst of all, when I tried to print a document to PDF with TextEdit, the results were very unpredictable; I had no idea where the page breaks were going to fall.  I finally broke down and decided to buy a word processor.  I use MS Office everyday on a PC at work, so it was the product I was most familiar with.  Still, I was worried about how it might work on my Imac.<br /><br />It only took 4 minutes to download the software.  Installation was quick, too.  I chose the \\""custom\\"" installation to make sure I only installed Word, Excel, and PowerPoint plus the language check for English only.  That way I was able to avoid installing a lot of \\""extras\\"" (like Messenger and the Outlook advertisement) that I don't want or need, and I avoided having the extra icons added to my text bar.  Word and Excel work pretty much the same as the WIndows software I use everyday at work.  I was able to save my file as a PDF, and the PDF file looked exactly how I had set up the Word file.  I'm glad I finally bought this software."
1,"At this point I have been using Ttax for the at least the past 15 years (been so long now I really don't know exactly).  I have found it to be a truly outstanding method of preparing my personal tax return.<br />By the way, did I mention that I am a CPA!"
1,For the price this gives you a lot of bang for the buck.  I wish there were a few more cook books on the product for Quick Starts
1,"MBAM is one of the very, very, very few pieces of software I have ever bought. I had to make a exception for it. In my humble opinion, it is one of the very best security softwares out there. I really trust it a lot. It is used where I work to look for malwares. I must admit that when I saw this product on Amazon with a lifetime license, I got a little suspicious, leery. &#34;What is the catch?&#34;, I asked myself. Its developer is not issuing lifetime licenses any longer, it stopped in the first quarter of last year. If you buy it on its website, you only get a one year subscription for 25 bucks. But I took the plunge and spent the 39 bucks on it. The &#34;My Account&#34; tab on the right upper side when clicked shows duration &#34;Lifetime&#34;. I also ran mbam-check(available on Malwarebytes homepage) and it also shows no date for &#34;Expiration Date.&#34; So, I think this is the real Mccoy. Besides, I do not really think Amazon would risk its reputation by badly misrepresenting something. But in order to be 100% sure, I will have to wait until next year to see if any message pops up asking for more money to renew my license. That would be, for me, a huge disappointment, with Amazon..."
0,"I am a very long time QB users and along with all of you received the message that the bank feature in QB2009 will now longer be supported after May. My one must have feature is going to be unavailable after May? Time to upgrade. After reading all the reviews decided \\""why not\\"" it couldn't be that bad. Paid my $134 dollars and started the upgrade. I will say that the download from Amazon was easy and the update all went very well.<br /><br />Now the bad news.. The program is slow to respond, the so called \\""new\\"" features are all basic and really nothing new. A user from QB2009 to QB2012 should not be expecting anything worth-wild and nothing exciting to start using. I will now be calling QB support to figure out my new error using the 30 days of support included in my purchase. I only hope it doesn't take 30 days to figure this out. \\""What a mess\\""<br /><br />For my $134 bucks I paid for the ability to continue using QB as before. The folks at Intuit should be ashamed making long time users pay to upgrade to keep the old features. I too fall in the the category that this extortion should be stopped. I hope that other users coming up on the May deadline read these and take them to heart. I wish I did...<br /><br />Update: Two weeks using QB2012 and program is very slow to respond \\""QuickBooks is not responding\\"" is now our office joke. We are walking around on break saying \\""QuickBooks is not responding\\"" its like a free pass! Next week we send out our invoice batches can't wait to see how this will work maybe I should go on vacation that week."
1,"We have three credit cards, business and personal expenses and numerous checking and savings accounts.  I have had a difficult time tracking all of our expenses.  What do we spend on eating out?  etc.  This answered all of my questions.  I love this product"
0,"I don't write much in the way of reviews, but this one is long overdue.  I've used the yearly iterations of this software since 2002.  The software itself has always been fine, and has helped me do my taxes effectively during that period.  However, a major reason for buying it all along has been the selling point of \\""Worry-free Audit Support\\"", and the company failed me spectacularly during 2010.      I received a letter from the IRS in the spring of 2010 saying that I had miscalculated income in 2007 filings related to an adoption.  Now, I'm not an aggressive tax person by any means - I don't take any exotic deductions, exemptions or credits, and try to make it so every year I might owe a couple hundred dollars, or get a small refund.  I pay my taxes, and that's fine.  Suddenly this letter from the IRS says I owe over $2500, and can I pay it now please, thank you very much?  Well, it was inaccurate on the part of the IRS - I had the papers, the program, the file, all of it... and after hyperventilating a bit, I called the IRS.  Essentially, I was told that I couldn't take the deduction, and I kept having this circular argument with the woman, where she simply couldn't understand why I thought I could have this deduction.  Here's where the H&R Block \\""Worry-free Audit Support\\"" people come in.      I spent 2 hours on the phone with this support guy, asking for some help in dealing with the matter.  He was polite;  He was intelligent; and he deliberately and specifically refused to provide any support at all, because it was an assessment, not an audit.  What???  What does that even mean??? For the next 2 hours, I read the fine print on their guarantee with him, and listened to him read scripted refusals about not providing a tax person to assist, a manager to speak with, a means of redress; I was told I was on my own.      So, ok, I'm on my own.  Next day, I try the IRS folks again.  Thank GOD you don't ever get the same person twice.  In 10 minutes, I had the problem fixed.  I pointed out the issue, asked if I could walk through the pertinent part of the file line by line; I got to the 3rd line and the new IRS lady says \\""Oh, I see, it's that same computer problem again.  This has been happening a lot lately.  You're ok, I'm fixing it now.\\""  \\""Wow... Ok, Thank you very much, you'll send a letter?  Thank you, thank you thank you!  Goodbye!\\""  No actual problem, I was right, IRS was wrong.  10 minutes on the phone.  But H&R Block's \\""Worry-free Audit Support\\""? NOT THERE FOR YOU.    So, again, the software in general has been fine, and if you buy it expecting to defend yourself to the IRS WITHOUT any help from the fine people at H&R Block, you'll be happy enough.  But if you need help related to ANYTHING to do with audits, assessments, or whatever, they will fail you.  My problem was thinking \\""Worry-free Audit Support\\"" meant if the IRS says you filed your taxes incorrectly, you'll have some help.  To H&R Block, \\""Worry-free Audit Support\\"" means \\""You'd better worry\\""."
0,"This download was a good deal at $235, but it went out of stock so I couldn't get it. I signed up to be notified when it was back in stock and not even 24hrs later Amazon has restocked it and raised the price to $263.84. That's a nice little bait and switch Amazon. So why download it when I can go to a local BJs or Costco and pick up the software for the same price now (Including Tax)?    Can't yet comment on the software, but don't waste your time on this download if you have a Costco or BJs membership.    Happy Hunting"
0,Rip off as H& R want to charge you 39.95 for the state software when you have more then one state tax to file. Only paid 29.95 for the Federal and state to start with. Stayed on hold on the phone for one hour and no one ever answered from customer service as to why they charge so much to file for one state.
0,This program was difficult for me to use. The directions are not clear enough. It is capturing items I didn't expect it to.
1,I went from the desktop version to the online version with no trouble.  It is a great product and easy to use!
1,Easy to use. Didn't see a difference that justifies the outrageous price difference between H&R and TurboTax.
0,"Having recently purchased a MacBook Pro, I was hoping to break the chains for all things PC. Having used Quicken since the 2003 version, I was hopeful Quicken for Mac would make my transition easier. Not so!<br /><br />While I don't use Quicken for bank reconciliation, tracking investments or any of the other online services, I was extremely disappointed to find out that this version of Quicken is even incapable of making a simple register and or category report. After all, a simple register report is basic to every Quicken for PC I have ever used, through the 2011 version.<br /><br />My solution was simple, throw Quicken for Mac into the trash, install Parallels and a fresh install of windows 7 on a virtual machine.  Once I installed my quicken 2011 onto the windows 7 virtual machine, I had the best of both worlds... Good old Quicken and the grace and speed of a Mac.<br /><br />I would not recommend Quicken for Mac, at least not until they put some serious effort into improving it!"

I've used TT Bus for the same trust with no problems for years. How do you break software that used to work correctly? And when is the fix really coming??  (...)"
1,"I have used it before and loved it. It is not working however with my newer Windows 8 computer. I have run the repair option, still does not work."
0,Did not read fine print and did not note the state was not included until got to it online.I did call Amazon and they said they would credit my account for this and I could place new order for the other version that included state in it. Just wish Turbo tax had not changed Deluxe version as in past always included state.
1,"I like Turbo Tax very much, but I don't like that the charge for e-filing state taxes is $19.00. It should be free also. Maybe I read it wrong. Intuit has also set up software for filing direct PA taxes, which is not user friendly, so I would have liked to e-file the state from Turbo Tax."
1,I love this product.  I have Norton at work and Norton sucks no updates.  Avast is great with the updates on a daily and hourly updates.
0,"I purchased Quicken 2015 for the mac late last year.  Starting in December I began having recurring problems  downloading my data from Wells Fargo.  No fix was permanent, and no amount of  Quicken chat help solved the problem.  It often made it worse.  Most recently, I got the downloads working again and then Wells Fargo sent me a notice that they were charging me for direct connect even though I was using quicken connect.  Three times they sent me a notice  and 3 times I called to cancel.  The final time I asked them to disconnect me from all Wells Fargo downloads through quicken.  This seems to have worked.<br />  In the mean time I have tried the program iBank 5.  This is a replacement for quicken designed specifically for the Mac.  It works great and I have no problem downloading my account info from Wells Fargo.<br />  My recommendation.  Ditch Quicken and get iBank 5."
1,Easy download and  the software runs great.
0,"The Personal program here is great.  If you want to do your personal taxes, you don't need to buy this version though, obviously you are buying this to do your Business (or in my case Estate) taxes.    The Business software is crap, and getting support for it is almost impossible.  DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,"As complicated as tax laws are, TurboTax makes it easy to understand new laws and to complete the needed forms."
0,"I WISH TO CANCEL THIS PRODUCT.  CANNOT DOWNLOAD PRODUCT,  CANNOT ACCESS AN ON LINE PERSON FOR ASSISTANCE.<br /><br />I HAVE ORDERED MANY PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON WITH NO PROBLEMS.  THIS ITEM SHOULD COME WITH A DISK<br />SO IT CAN BE LOADED LOCALLY."
0,I have learned my lesson. Do not get things on sale especially if its Black Friday. I knew someone who worked at retail and said everything they sell is old inventory. At least I attempted to buy very cheap.
1,so good and its free
1,I have had Avast for 5 years with no problems. I found Norton and others run to many programs which made the computer run to slow.<br />You have nothing to lose here so try it if you don't like it uninstall it.I doubt you'll be doing  that though.
0,I paid extra to get the state portion but when you get to the end you have to pay more to e-file.
0,"This is an indictment of Amazon's customer service, not Adobe's product. I subscribed because there was a special offer of $25 credit attached. I was supposed to get it by 4/7. Time goes by and nothing happens. I call on 4/16 and multiple times the following days, only to get transferred to various departments, ending up at Software Download. They kept saying we'll submit your issue to Marketing since they handle this. 2 TIMES I called and they submitted and nothing ever happens. Today, 4/24, I called again, and they finally realize it is about a S-U-B-S-C-R-I-P-T-I-O-N!!!!! I'VE BEEN REPEATING SUBSCRIPTION AND THEY WERE ALL THINKING PRODUCT, PRODUCT, PRODUCT!!!!!! I'm not trying to be insulting here, but the drones at Amazon customer service have ZERO IQ!!! Some smarts, yes, but no intelligence. They literally cannot think outside the box, or script. General products? Perfect. Subscriptions? It's like they've never heard of such a thing!! When someone says Adobe subscription, most people would understand software subscription. Not these people. They literally do not know their own product!! Idiots is an appropriate description. DO NOT EVER BUY A SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION HERE. THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU!!! YOU WILL WASTE MUCH TIME AND MENTAL ENERGY!!! For me, I will begin shifting my purchases to eBay or elsewhere. I think there has been other complaints about Amazon service related to software subscriptions. Too bad Amazon, YOU BLEW IT."
1,Great product
1,great and easy to use. Have not had an attack since it was installed.
1,Easy and quick process
1,No problems encountered and works as expected.
1,"I had huge problem with AVG Free and Windows 7 and 8.  Had to re-image my laptop twice...Avast so far (about 3 months) my laptop works fine, fast.  Had to uninstall skype last week, as I noticed after I installed it the OS started to take too much time not only during boot (I unchecked it from starting with OS) but also in the middle of working with other tasks."
1,"Not very compatable but I still love it. Can't transfer stuff to Microsoft without it changing stuff around, when I already have it formatted correctly"
1,"I bought this program very cheap at a thrift store.  Even though this program is a bit dated I was able to produce a professional looking resume.  The spell checker is located in a word shell program and gives you the opportunity to edit.  In the shell you can export the final product to E-mail, Word, PDF, HTML, RTF and Text or Publish Online. I was suprised to find so many resume style types, many with colors and graphics if you want to get fancy with it. Has excellent videos and audio tips built right in.  It has at least 50 federal forms.  Has many tips in PDF form for interviews cover letters etc. I'm so pleased with program that I'm going buy the newest version.  But with the results I have thus far I don't really have to upgrade.  I'm only upgrading because I like the program so much.  I visited their website; it has lots of other productivity applications for employment and various other things.  I plan to explore the site.  There is a learning curve with the program but once you get the hang of it you're in total command to kick out some excellent resumes and cover letters. So you can't go wrong by purchasing this program.  Highly recommended."
0,It didn't pickup my last two returns so I'm not very happy about that.
1,"So much better than the Windows voice recognition software!  Like a breath of fresh air when I switched.<br /><br />Began using  first Windows and then Dragon after breaking my arm.  Dragon allowed me to effectively go back to work.  I find it works well for composing letters and emails and any kind of writing where you are creating sentences and context.  The software loves context and figures out the words very well.  Its much less helpful filling out forms or listening to single words.<br /><br />I was able to get the hang of the navigation throughout my computer pretty well.  I also liked the commands structure much better than the Windows software.  Its smarter and I had far fewer errors.  The windows didn't learrn as quickly and frequently couldn't respond to commands.<br /><br />The software does learn and get smarter as you use it.  Can be a bit frustrating getting used to it but keep at it.  It will learn your voice pretty quickly and become more effective for you as you keep using it.<br /><br />It does require some processing power to run.  If you have an old computer, it will be quite slow and take up a lot of system resources.  When I put it on newer machines, it was able to keep up with my speech pace well and did not impact performance of my other programs.  I tried it on 3 computers:<br />2009 Lenovo laptop - ran really really slow - almost unusable.<br />2015 Lenovo Flex 2 laptop with 6 GB RAM - runs very well, keeps up with my pace of speech and very accurate.  I do turn it off when I am not using it as it does take up some system resources to run in background.<br />2012 ZT with AMD 2.9 GHz processor and 16 GB RAM - runs best on this machine.  Very fast and no need to turn it off as it does not slow down my machine.<br /><br />Make sure you disable the Windows SR if you install Dragon as you won't want them both running simultaneously.<br /><br />I used an old, cheap microphone and it worked fine.  No need to purchase an expensive one.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this software for anyone who can't type well or is experiencing pain typing.  I probably won't use it much now that I have recovered and can type faster than I can Dragon but its nice to have the option when my hand gets sore.  Well worth the money as it got me back to work 6 -8 weeks earlier than I would have otherwise.I would definitely recommend this software for anyone who can't type well or is experiencing pain typing.

1,I have had AVAST installed on both of my computers for the past few years and feel way more comfortable with this antivirus software than I ever have with ANY other security software!!! I recommend this software to as many people as I can!
1,I've been a PaintShop Pro user for years. It's a good product for photo editing with a lot of capabilities.
1,"I have not run into the problems that others have encountered, but that may be because I am only using it to track what is in each of my accounts.  I have been using Quicken for over a decade.  During that time it has never crashed and I have never lost any data.  Whenever I upgraded to a new version the old data was quickly and correctly converted to the new format.  There are certain actions that I wish were easier to perform, there are some displays that could be updated, but the bottom line is that for me it has always worked."
1,"Interiors is for the person who is not interested in exteriors or the \\""whole process\\"", its focus is to the inside, lots of choices for materials, furniture, fixtures and cabinets. You can draw a detailed, dimensioned room in a few minutes.<br />This software is not for the Licensed Interior Decorator, but rather for the amateur designer (if you are a Pro, you need to get Chief Premier Interiors which is designed just for you). I am teaching two local Interior Designers this software and they both love it.<br />So if your designs are not so grand and demanding this software will suit you just fine."

0,"This is the buggiest software I have seen in a long time. No regard for flexibility and convenience at all...    It starts with the installer. First you need to download Amazon Installer, just to be able to download the tax software. The download auto-extracts to C:\Program Files\... (and my OS happens to be on D: drive!). Then you are prompted to save installation package in some other place. Only then can you install the tax software while the tax filing key remains somewhere in the online Amazon account... way too complicated!    The program is being silently blocked by every firewall imaginable and even by Avast antivirus. Even with all antiviruses and firewalls disabled, it sometimes won't connect to internet or print to PDF and need to be killed, and then start working again with no system settings changed. Just seeing that HTTP request failed takes 5 long minutes of pointless progress bar animation.     I have used previous generations of TaxCut and was quite satisfied. But the 2009 version is a poor poor software engineering job!"
1,"I just started my own business less than a year ago. I have one employee and my accountant recommended that I just use a spreadsheet in order to save money. I did for about 2 months, then I started shopping for accounting software. Looked at reviews. Tried demos. QB Online has been the best for the money. I like that an Estimate can be turned into an Invoice with one click. I can generate professional looking quotes and invoices with consistency for my clients. I can even import my logo into the invoice. I have already recommended this to friends that also have small businesses.<br />I do wish that there was a specific place on estimates and invoices to put a client's PO number or project name. As it is, I have to enter it as the first line item.<br />I like that I can sync it with my checking and credit card account. QB syncs the data and allows me to assign categories. QB even detects and suggest a category for each transaction. I have the option to keep or reassign the category, even split the transaction. I highly recommend this to any small business."

0,This product is worthless.  The activation code will not permit installation.  Wondershare does not recognize me as a purchaser since I bought the software through Amazon.  Guess where I will not make more purchases.

0,"This is a perfect example of &#34;If it ain't broke don't fix it&#34;.  This is a horrible program and the tutorial doesn't help. My Acrobat 9,x was corrupted and could only be salvaged by deleting and reinstalling.  This proved impossible because of the roadblocks imposed by Adobe so I thought it would just be easier to by XI, which has turned out to be a disaster. I wanted to get back to Acrobat 9 and spent an hour with a nice lady in India.  She informed me that I didn't have Acrobat 9 or if I did have it, it wasn't registered.  I asked her why, then, did Adobe allow me to buy an install Acrobat 11 upgrade.  She said she would check and that was the last I heard of her.  So I bought a disk copy of Acrobat 9 on ebay.  When I tried to install it I got a message saying that I already had a better version on my machine.  It then terminated the install.  So I am now going to have to uninstall Acrobat 11 and see if the IRS will let me write off the $199 as a charitable donation to Adobe .:&#62;)  I will not try to download and upgrade to version 9.0 because you can't buy an upgrade -- you have to buy a subscription!"
1,I love the upgrades to the ledgers.  I do trade options a lot and wish the types of trade would include selling and buying options on a stock.
1,I have been using TurboTax for my U.S. and California taxes for over a decade now and the product continues to keep me happy. I used it when I ran my own sole proprietorship and now back as an employee only and have been happy on all versions.
0,"I purchase a lot of items from Amazon but have never taken the time to write a review.  Almost all items that I order from Amazon work well and I take it for granted that this is the way things should be.  It takes a real problematic product like Quicken 2013 to motivate me to take valuable time out of my day to write a review.<br /><br />I have been using Quicken, TurboTax and Expensable since 1998 and have--UNTIL LAST WEEK--been very pleased and favorably impressed with their products.  UNTIL LAST WEEK I have heartily recommended the Intuit product line to friends and business associates.<br /><br />LAST WEEK MY VIEW TOOK A SHARP, NEGATIVE TURN FOR THE WORSE.<br /><br />This 2013 product is simply not ready for prime time.  It is buggy in my experience and refused to load one out of three accounts and one bank for web sharing.  Various print functions on my menu system do not work.  During the last week there have been no less than two different software updated released to try to fix the issues (remember this product is all of a couple weeks old).  Even when it works, it does not web synch any accounts that are not essentially current assets/liabilities used for personal purposes--weak!<br /><br />What we have here--in my experience--does not even qualify as reasonable Beta version software!<br /><br />What management oversights at Intuit would have allowed them to release such junk is just beyond me.  Are there no quality control folks testing this product?  Is the senior management so out-of-touch with the developers that they could not have foreseen that this product was not ready for prime time?<br /><br />Was it not foreseeable that software of this ilk would likely wind up in the hands or \\""early-adopter\\"" customers of long standing with Intuit software?  Releasing this software while it was in this state of ill-preparedness is the classic \\""wrong way Corrigan\\"" of marketing.  It disappoints and offends long-standing loyal customers and diminishes brand value and brand loyalty.<br /><br />There are a number of nice responses from Intuit on this board regarding their trying to fix the many problems quickly and efficiently.  This is, I am sure, well intentioned.  It does not address the salient point here, however: THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NEVER HAVE SHIPPED IN THIS CONDITION.<br /><br />TO NOTE ONE FINAL INSULT HERE:  Intuit has typically tried to prevent migration back to an earlier version of their software by converting your existing databases into a newer format after you have upgraded to a later version of their software.  While this is annoying, it is good, sound marketing from their standpoint.  That is--good and sound marketing until you ship a buggy mess like this software.  ONCE YOU HAVE INSTALLED THIS PROBLEMATIC SOFTWARE IT IS DIFFICULT TO REVERT TO THE PRIOR VERSION.<br /><br />Save your money and wait on this product.  I am sure that Intuit will get it right eventually--they certainly have in the past.  At this juncture they have a big smudge on them from my perspective.[[ASIN:B008S0IE5M Quicken Home & Business 2013 [Download]]]"
1,i have this for my desktop and laptop and i love it havent had a problem yet with it yet been over a year and for a really really good price and takes minutes to install
1,This is a Anti-Virus app that doesn't need any intervention.<br />Seamless integration in to Windows 7 and provides first class protection.<br />I would recommend it to all.
1,Love the bank interface
1,I love it
1,Very good and easy to  find it and the KEY. I couldn't misplace the KEY because it was always available on Amazon site. I put it on all of my computers. Very GOOD!
1,"I have rental properties and Turbo Tax Premier was the answer for me. It walked me through everything easily and setup all my schedules like they should be. About 6 years ago, I had an accountant setup our farm and do our taxes, 2 years later I decided to do it in Turbo Tax, it found an error in the depreciation schedule that the accountant setup. I had to file amended taxes and received refunds for both years. I will always use Turbo Tax, it's so easy and thorough."
0,"Buyer Beware!!!    Schedule D is no longer included and requires a $30 uplift to Premier. This is close to being a scam. I have used TurboTax since 1997 and this is the first time Schedule D is not included.    I only noticed this after purchasing the product on release day and later reading the other Amazon reviews. Sure enough, when I try to enter a dummy stock sell transaction I am being told that \\""TurboTax Deluxe does not cover your situation blah blah blah\\"""
1,"I bought this software after trying it for free a while back. I purchased it at their official page in www.connectify.com with the lifetime license. I have a 3G connection via an usb, and I needed a way to share this internet in my house for the use of other laptops and mobile devices. After using it for free I quickly bought it because it promises 3G/4G features. If it wasn't because it disconnects after a few minutes of continuous working hotspot I'd review it with a 5 star rating.<br /><br />It's an overall good software, and it's easy to use. Works good enough and the price is worth it, mainly because it's a lifetime license and it's not that expensive.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to people in need of a way to share their one only way to internet connection."
1,I like the old days when it expired you could still use the product till you found the price that fit your budget. Now days when it expires you are out of protection and have to either buy it or take the risk.<br />This was my first time buying a down load. I have always wanted the hard copy in hand. I still have the hard copies from the last five years.<br />Amazon down load is pretty easy and I found the cheapest price here with out having to send in rebates and wait months for the rebate to show up.<br />I am going to look here from now on when I am shopping for new software.
0,Easy to follow and complete my fed and state return but an extra $20 to efile state....no thanks.  Just did the free fed efile and then went to my state's web site and efiled there for free.
1,This software made filing taxes so much easier by providing all the needed forms and allowing for quick electronic filing.
1,"Started using it last month. so I am new user. There is a little bit of a learning curve going through all the options. But I think once you spend littl etime, this is a very helpful product for anyone who is on 1099 or own small business."
1,I love it! It is very easy to use. It really saves me a lot of time when working with pictures for web sites and flyers!
1,Very Good
1,very good for your computer.thank you
1,"This is a great download ! easy to use, and you can't beat the price !<br />I would definiitly recommend it to all my friends"
1,"I got it for 6.99 but after I bought it they raised it to 10 bucks.  It works well. More features that norton antivirus 2011.  No waiting, no cd, no hassle!     downloads quickly and easily. I do not know why some people pay over 30 bucks for this software when they could buy it for cheap.  extra features that the AVG Free Edition does not have. I even got one free AVG PC Tune Up download along with it  (there's a link that shows up after installing this) and my old dell deminsion 3000 runs like new and fast and it also fixed 3,000 errors on my registry.  I totally recommend this product! Why pay more for the cd and shipping?  Buy now! This is good for one year!    *UPDATE*  It still works well and caught quite a few viruses and spyware.  Amazon seems to change the prices of this. I paid only $6.99, and today I looked and saw it for $23.99. I am baffled."
1,Very easy to use and worked just as I expected.
0,"I do not normally bother writing reviews, but Avast just gave me a notification-popup to review their product, so....since they asked...    Like AVG before it, Avast started out as a wonderful piece of free software, but as time progressed, its focus has gradually shifted to becoming more and more commercial.  Nag screens to 'Upgrade' to the pay-version started appearing with greater frequency.  Notifications for updates to newer versions now border on bait&switch tactics, with a very prominent 'Upgrade' button which will make you pay, and smaller, less visible 'Update' button if you wish to continue with the free version.    Also, annoying notifications for additional products (ex: GrimeFighter), which require the pay version.  Notifications which can be turned off..... if you pay."
1,"It's Norton, what's NOT to like?"
0,"As an employee within an IT organization, this company should be embarrassed for putting this product out.  It doesn't work - crashes all the time and you can rarely save your documents.  It has potential but they apparently don't know how to test their software and, if they do, they don't care how it works.  Amazon - you are nuts for selling this and I want my money back.  I will pay better attention to the feedback next time around."
1,"My experience has been very good with Quicken products. I waited a little while to purchase the 2013 edition due to the concerns people had with some of the features (mainly the online sync for mobile access) and now that they've had time to work out the bugs from the production environment I have to say it is a great product.<br /><br />I've tried a few other products in lieu of the Quicken line and always end up coming back due to its usability, product feature set and the support it has.<br /><br />Thanks for making a great product Quicken, and thank you for supporting it properly for your customer base!"
0,Unable to complete installation.
0,Bought Turbo Tax for Home and Business. Wasn't aware I bought Deluxe.  I'll have to check this out.
1,Didn't get a free state like I thought I would.  Program is much better than any other.  I've used Turbo Tax for years and will again.
0,"Used trend for 5 years with no security problems.  The package I bought was good for up to 3 computers.  When I bought a laptop ( just the second computer ) I started getting notices that I had exceeded my limit, with a typical click button to buy more button.  $80.00 later I found I had bought second coverage that I didn't need.  Nowhere in any of the harassment windows was there an option to discover that I had already paid for coverage.<br /><br />Now the big DANGER.  Trend has set up their process so you cannot contact a human or even email someone related to billing issues.  In 2 hours of effort the only phone numbers I found were 1)a subcontracted provider who told me (in an Indian accent) to try another number. That number 2) an automated line referring to a web site that I had already seen twice and was useless.<br />Today the charge on my credit card only shows as pending.  Tomorrow I will find out the mechanics of stopping payment."
1,"They guy who maintains my laptop recommended Avast Antivirus and installed it for me about six months ago. So far, I haven't had a single problem with viruses, and I don't get all the annoying ads like I have with some other antivirus software."
0,"What's so deluxe about it if it doesn't include the state version - which is available for an extra $30 or something like that.<br /><br />Watch what you buy - H&R Block has sliced and diced their versions so finely, it's hard to keep track."
1,"I have been using checkbook for years and love it. Simple and easy to use, then my computer died and got another one and had the chance to upgrade to the productivity pack and love the envelope printer, everything is really easy to use and setup for a novice like me.<br />Great product with great support!"
0,"I'm very, very saddened.  I've been using and supporting photoshop for years and buying the CS version for $500 for years.  How are us digital artists who use photoshop everyday supposed to work like this?  This is so stupid and absurd.  We need the physical copies, not a horrible cloud service."
1,I have used Avast for several years now & have been very pleased with it.  It is also rated the best free virus protection by Consumer Reports.  It's a great tool & a great deal!
1,Been using it on my home computers for 8 years and have had just one SUSPECTED infection that was easily cleared up by other means. Interface is seamless with automatic daily updates and a convenient and easily maneuvered control panel. I recommend it.
1,Good
0,This product is so elusive and filled with come-ons to buy more of their software that I wonder how they're selling on Amazon. DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE!
0,"It's hard to see what improvements have been made ... especially from the perspective of one who uses the software primarily to track home and business expenses.  No portfolio management, no loan or mortgage tracking.  Just downloads from banks and credit cards, simple budgeting and spending analysis.<br /><br />We definitely need it ... but could have soldiered on perfectly well with Quicken 12 if download support had been maintained.  That's what we paid for."
1,"Webroot has been the best on the market for 10 years. No anti-virus program is perfect against every virus out there. There are 1000's of viruses made all the time.<br /><br />I'm a Computer Technician. I've been cleaning viruses off computers for about 15 years now, and have been recommending Webroot since it was called Spy Sweeper 10 years ago.<br /><br />It's rare for someone to bring a computer into my shop with viruses with Webroot as their protection. If they do have a virus, it's a virus that pretty much every other anti-virus protection on the market would have missed too. Plus, it's most likely that it's the only virus they have. So, you don't have hundreds of others to deal with too. Makes is a lot easier to clean off.<br /><br />This newest version of Webroot is lightning fast compared to everything else out there. Uses like no memory or resources. It doesn't bug the hell out of you like most of them do. It usually sits quietly in the system tray minding it's own business, not bothering anyone.<br /><br />The Webroot with firewall, will pop up and ask you if you want to let a program access to the Internet. But it usually only asked that question once, for that program.<br /><br />Webroot is the most user friendly protection out there, and installs in like 30secs. Fastest protection on the market. Only protection I recommend. Buy it now!"
1,Good language study
0,This by far the most invasive software I have ever gotten from Norton.<br />Constantly pops up wanting  to put Norton tool bar.you put no and it always pops up.<br />Blocks thinhg s that you say safe etc.<br />If there is another one buy that one!!!!
1,easy to use v. photo shop - - - requires some setup of libraries and folders - - all in all eccellent
1,Great product...I use it on both my lap top and desk top computers and it keeps both in<br />very good running order.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to protect their computers.
0,Cannot run alongside home and business. Tech support is a joke.  Unable to resolve compatibility issue. Just not very pleased
0,"Been a TurboTax user for two decades ... agree with the many other reviews ... lessor product for more money.  I've always just downloaded the program and used it including the product designed for small business for several years.  This year, I had the first ten minutes of my tax return complete (before prompted to save the file) and the program crashed.  Just another indicator. I don't know which program I'll go to next year, but it won't be Turbo Tax -- UNLESS INTUIT WANTS TO GET IT TOGETHER.<br /><br />UPDATE:  As I was working on my return via the interview process - was asked if I'd paid property taxes on boats, rv's, etc.  i answered yes -- was taken to the screen where I was to enter the amount -- guess what -- program would not take the input .... high price poorer quality??  I'd say so."
0,"I've used Quicken for many years prior to switching to Microsoft Money and then when that was discontinued switched back and have been using Quicken since 2010. In all those years and even after coming back, I've never had any problems. I purposely avoided upgrading to 2013, 2014 due to the numerous issues with those products that I read about but this past year I was forced to move to 2015 to continue use the online banking features. And now I've lost all my data using Quicken 2015.    The other night I was doing a simple balance adjustment when Quicken 2015 crashed. And by crashed I mean \\""just disappeared\\"". Having had this happen previously with this version, I restarted the program and entered my password for my data file. At this point Quicken 2015 reported that my password was wrong. Fine, I typed it again. Still said it was wrong. Finally I realized there was something wrong.    Went to Quicken Support and downloaded their Password recovery tool. That failed.    Contacted support and was quickly escalated to their data research team. So much for that - after uploading my file, received an email that my data file was UNRECOVERABLE with the recommendation to either go to a back-up (which has the same issue for up to 1 month back I can see) or start a NEW data file. The support data research team indicated this was a hardware/software issue on my side. In any case, any product that completely corrupts its data with no chance for fixing it is not something I can trust for my personal finances any more.    I am severely disappointed with Quicken and their support at this time. Until the quality of this product is greatly increased, I don't see how it can be trusted knowing that it could potentially corrupt this data again and not be recovered."
0,"The biggest waste of money ever, would like to have a refund!!  They said this would not work on my computer<br />and wanted me to spend another $275.00 protection. I can buy another laptop for that kind of money. I think I<br />should stick with Nortin thats on my other laptop which works great. Total RIP OFF!!!!!"
0,"The new Office version is, as you would expect, very like the older versions. In fact, if someone didn't tell you you were using the latest version, you probably wouldn't know it.<br /><br />But like quite a few of the other users here, I don't care if it's better or not; I'm just fuming at the gall (and price) of Microsoft's new subscription strategy. I'm one of the fast growing number of customers that's gone from neutral to an intense dislike of microsoft.<br /><br />Though I gotta say, they've got a business model that's great (for them); become the industry standard and make sure your product won't play at all (let alone nice) with other products. Make a bunch of money selling licenses to users that represents a profit margin of at least 800%, at a guess (a pretty box, a few pages booklet, and a 5 cent CD, for $150 or so). Then when that's not enough for you, force everyone to have to subscribe annually, and raise the price, even though your cost is now drastically less than it was distributing boxed CDs. So the profit margin is now - what, in the thousands of percent? So instead of having to shell out $150 or so about every 2 to 5 years, millions and millions of customers now must pay $100 a year no matter what.<br /><br />I can - and do - use freeware for my own docs, but for working with client docs, I'm still stuck with the evil one's products. It's a total monopoly; there are no viable alternatives, and they will crush any competitor who tries to offer one. (What happened to anti-trust actions, anyway? Or is microsoft \\""too big to prosecute\\""?)<br /><br />But being so cavalier about losing customer good will may yet come back to bite microsoft as they deserve. If a competitor with a real alternative does come along, they will have a legion of angry users eager to jump ship."
1,I find the MAC version has one major advantage over the PC version--one can track ALL credit cards and bank accounts even when they may be under different names at the same financial institution.
1,"[I hope that the unhappy reviewer who followed me (above) was not misled by my recommendation.  I continue to use the program  (I have no coonection with, or vested interest in, the company), and I find it the easiest and most effective among several that I've managed to collect (some of which no longer work nearly as efficiently as when I first got them).  I've never tried to contact the company (have had no need), so I can't comment on service.  I didn't know the company was in China (most are located in Eastern Europe).  One slight irritant has caught my attention: the program tends to operate in the background, downloading and converting youtube videos that it was not my intention to collect.  There may be a way to deactivate this feature.]<br /><br />[2nd after-thought: perhaps the other reviewer and the person who gave me a negative have made the same discovery as I.  I've been shopping for a DVD creator/burner on Google and in the App Store. 80% of the time the program I've inspected, and sometimes purchased, turns out to be another software program made by the same company WonderShare, which apparently does not want to disclose its identity more than necessary (Google a review before purchase).  I continue to have pretty good success with this downloader (occasionally, \\""auto convert\\"" does not change the file to one that my new iMac recognizes, so I'm deducting a star).  But the hard-sell, often misleading tactics of this company are cause for concern.  They apparently have up to 10 titles for the same program!  And the prices will vary dramatically, from $20 to $50.  Moreover, I was about to download one of their programs--away from Apple Store--until I got to the final step after giving my credit card and saw an additional fee: it was a $7 surcharge for having the program number of your purchase \\""stored\\"" by the company for \\""all of\\"" one year!!  Compare that with Amazon, where I can call up purchases, invoice and order numbers from 10 or more years back.  What if Amazon charged me $5 or more every time I looked up an order number!  That little \\""extra fee\\"" (I've never seen anything like it elsewhere) really turned me off on WonderShare.  The company's going to have to perform wonders with my videos, DVDs, etc. before they win back my trust.];<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I know several jazz fans who never get near computers and who are most grateful when I give them a DVD of jazz all-stars, whether Ella, Duke, and Dexter Gordon or Miles, Coltrane and Bill Evans.  But unless you stay on top of this dicey business, it can become awfully time-consuming and far from consistent.  Handbrake along with a tutorial on youtube can get you there for free, but it's got a learning curve.  None of the pricey programs I had purchased in the past--most recently \\""Grappler\\""--were getting the job done without a lot of extra help from me.  Then I gave Wondershare a spin.  Smooth, flawless, automatic--and that's what you can presently do for free!  After downloading 10 hours of concert material I practically felt I owed it to the developer to buy the program.  You could use Wondershare for the downloading and find a free conversion program--but again we're talking more time and monkey business that I'm able to devote to the project.<br /><br />At this stage, Wondershare strikes me as the fastest, easiest, most effective way to download youtube videos--try it yourself.  If you like it, just keep it and use it with some coversion program--or pay the freight and make conversion as automatic and instant as downloading.  It's hard to say whether the program will be as effective next year--by that time Google will probably have re-encoded youtube videos to assure no downloading except through their ever larger, greedier hands.  So act fast.  Download your favorite artists (it's disappointing to discover how many of the greats are not to be found on video anywhere) while it's still possible.<br /><br />If you buy through Wondershare, they'll try to induce you to make a number of extra purchases.  Ignore them, as well as the \\""warranty\\"" (seven bucks).  In fact, if you purchase from Amazon, they may have you covered should you lose the program.<br /><br />[P.S. I suspect that other consumers will, like me, not want to spend an hour or so studying up on all of the compression codecs before selecting one for conversion purposes. I decided to waste several DVDs in order to find the best-looking one.  My findings: MPEG-2 is as good as any, it's faster than a couple of others, and it holds more videos than some of the codecs boasting higher resolution and/or audio quality.]'ll try to induce you to make a number of extra purchases.

0,"If you just want Quicken to track your bank accounts, this works fine. It doesn't do well importing investments and it can't do budgets like Quicken Deluxe for PC does. The reporting is also much more limited and I haven't found a way to output the reports to a spreadsheet."
0,"Quickbooks Payroll/Intuit has the worst customer service in the software industry.  With most software that might not be a huge issue, because you shouldn't typically have to interface with them.  But with Quickbook's Payroll, interfacing with them is often necessary, because the service doesn't work, or because they need to squeeze more money out of you.  And again,  it's the worst.  The payroll setup rarely works on the first try, so you call the number they provide.  Which, in the case of Quickbooks 2013 is no longer a valid number.  When my subscription expired, I received an email to click the reactivate button.  The link didn't work.  The webpage to reactivate didn't work.either.  And the phone number was bad.  When I finally found a valid number, the rep tried to sell me a renewal for $349/year when you can buy a brand new subscription for $199.  Plus Quickbooks Enhanced Payroll used to cover 3 employees, now they've downgraded it to 1.  If you still have an option to go with another service DO SO!  I would, but changing over seems like an insurmountable hurdle at this stage."
1,One of the best animation software's out there!!
1,"I love this software, it is my go to 3d compositor, fast, easy, and intuitive interface with a no nonsense approach to getting things done! the only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is that it normalizes the audio on export, this can have undesirable effects for me. If I could switch that feature off and on when needed, that would be fantastic."
0,"I'll start of with the 'Pros', since it's a smaller list, but please make sure to read the 'Cons' as well.<br /><br />PROS<br />+ I like that you can see all your accounts in one spot, opposed to having to go to Accounts &#62;List<br />+ I like that the columns can be moved in the order that I want them<br />+ I like that you can choose which columns you want to see<br /><br />CONS<br />- When using export, the ‘Export Options’ won’t allow the beginning date to change.  It won’t let the ending date change either.  So where are the “options”???<br />- Will not allow to export to a CSV file<br />- No choice to export to Excel (.xls) like Q2007 used to do<br />  = Further, since this is a Mac-based program, shouldn’t an option be to export in Numbers format???<br />- No longer are there automated back-ups.  This is a step in the wrong direction<br />- No ‘Balance Adjustment’!  So much easier to do this when updating property and asset values.  I also used it for my investments, because I just want to know the monthly balance.  It used to be so easy….<br />- When reconciling, I liked the screen that popped up which let you fill in interest and bank charges.  Now I have to ‘add’ a transaction and fill it in that way.  Very annoying!<br />- The method of reconciling was much better in Q2007.  It listed of all the unreconciled items up to the date of the statement ending date.  Also, an ‘uncheck all’ box. Q2015 reconciliation is not user friendly.  I wish I could describe it, but it would be too hard a read.<br />- When in a split transaction, you cannot use the arrow keys to move up and down in a category.   <br />- Split transactions always ‘open' when selecting that specific line.  This is annoying!<br />- When filling out a split deposit transaction, it used to total it up for you if you left it blank.  Now, it carries forward whatever the last deposit amount was, unless you overwrite it with a new amount (you can't just leave it blank).When I have a lot of deposits, it’s nice to log them into the Quicken register and have the program total it up so that I can transfer that total onto my deposit slip (before I take it to the bank). Now that feature is no more.<br />- No longer able to ‘right click’ within the register to do a report on a payee or a category (I really miss this!)<br />- I miss the ‘void’ transaction<br />- Not as many choices in ‘Reports’.  This is HUGE!  Bring back the reporting functionality of Q2007!  This is one of the major reasons that I am switching back to Q2007<br />- Printing reports has lost a lot of options.<br />  = can’t change the font<br />  = can’t change the font size<br />  = the report looks very pretty on screen, but it is terrible to print (unless you want to print all in color).  I print 30 reports a month, every month  The cost of color ink would be too expensive for the non-profit organization that I am the treasurer of.  The report/printing function should look at least acceptable in B&W.<br /><br />I’m sure I’ve missed a few things, both in the ‘Pro’ column and the ‘Con’ column.  And I have really, REALLY tried to like Q2015.  However, Q2015 is nothing more than Quicken Essentials.  If I had wanted Quicken Essentials, then that would have been what I would have purchased.<br />Q2015 is no upgrade, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would request a refund, but unfortunately, I bought it a little over 60 days ago and Intuit WILL NOT refund over 60 days.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!"
1,This was my first time doing my own taxes and this software was great. I finished in one day and got my return in 7 days.
0,Won't let me efile second state's return!!!!!  And this is 8:00 p.m. in the evening of 4/15/2015.  No post office is open within an hour's drive.  What kind of moron designed this software?
1,I'm in California. I used this to file my taxes (married joint with itemized deductions) and it was extremely easy. This was my first year doing my own taxes and I will never go back to anyone else.  This software made the process very easy and provided plenty of guidance when you're unsure of something.
1,Works better than on my PC.  All the old ingredients I needed too.  Did not have to learn a new program.
1,Great for home use
0,Did not trust it. Ended up getting an attorney to draw up my needed documents.
1,I use it every year and have had no problems.
1,"I used the free version for several years through several &#34;Operating Systems Du Jour&#34; and it worked great, cleaning up general crap that collects every time you use your computer. I finally, after using the company for free for so many years purchased the Pro version that works in the background quietly but only partially cleaning your computer. I use this program every time I begin to log off. First I will use a PC Tune Up tool that comes with an online tech service I purchased (much like one available through Geek Squad but mine is from IYOGI). I then clean all the cookies from my session using the tools portion of Chrome and lastly run a full scan using CCleaner. This sounds like it would take a while but it only takes about 3 minutes or so and it keeps my computer as fast as the day I bought it (and no one is tracking my computer usage!). I NEVER get a pop up, seldom get any spam and what spam I do get is from Vendors selling my email address after I make a purchase. This is a terrific program that really does help keep your computer clutter free no matter how much &#34;surfing&#34; you do. I HIGHLY recommend at least the free version and the cost of the Pro version is so small that it is very much worth it and allows you the use of the softwares updates which occur about every 2 weeks or so. Superb program even in its free form, the Pro version is MUCH better and is inexpensive!!"
1,"The sky is the limit with lightroom. I was a little nervous I would be cheating myself by not taking the plunge into photoshop, but I am 100% satisfied with my purchase with lightroom."
1,"Not sure what all the bad reviews are about.  I upgraded from 2011 Premier and it worked flawlessly.  Conversion worked quickly and flawlessly.  Software is LOT faster than my 2011 version.  Sometimes it would take several minutes to update my accounts in the 2011 version.. this one updated in probably under a minute.  I hate the fact quicken forces you to upgrade and actually disables online account updating from financial institutions every couple of years, but it sure makes tracking everything in one place nice.  No issues here with the upgrade.."
0,"The product is ok but no different than dobe E9. The reason I am giving one star it is because of the fact that we need an adobe ID even after purchasing the product. Waste of time, when all I need is some quick editing of my pictures. Unless I missed something during my purchase Amazon or Adobe should have made clear about the ID."
1,"(Updated, September 28, 2015)<br /><br />I am a long-time user of Microsoft Office. In fact, I have owned versions of Office since Windows 95 debuted twenty years ago.<br /><br />Late last year, I decided to purchase a subscription to Office 365. I opted for &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; because it was the least expensive way for me to get the software I wanted with all of the features I needed.<br /><br />At the time I subscribed, &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; came with the 2013 versions of Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Word. On September 22, 2015, Microsoft released the 2016 versions of all its Office programs; I have recently updated to these latest versions. I use Excel and Word almost every day, PowerPoint infrequently, and OneNote almost never. I found the 2013 versions just different enough in appearance and functionality from my &#34;Office 2007 Home and School&#34; suite that they created a bit of a &#34;learning curve&#34; for me. It didn't take me long to adjust to the changes in the newer versions, but I discovered that I liked the 2007 version just a little bit better - enough so that I eventually gravitated back to using my tried-and-true &#34;Office 2007&#34; programs almost exclusively. Now I plan to give the 2016 versions a good workout to see if they are the ones that best suit my needs on a daily basis. My initial impression of the new versions is pretty positive.<br /><br />I kept my &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; subscription active, however, and I'm very glad I did. Earlier this year, Microsoft released &#34;free&#34; versions of &#34;Office 365&#34; for Android devices. There was a catch to this release though: Android versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote provided only limited (what Microsoft euphemistically calls &#34;core&#34;) functionality... that is, unless users happened to have an active subscription to any one of the &#34;Office 365&#34; versions. Users {like me) who do have a subscription have all of the &#34;Office 365&#34; features at their fingertips.<br /><br />Is &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; worth the money spent on a subscription? If you already own any previous version of Microsoft Office, and use it only on a PC, probably not. However, the program's value rises sharply if you want to use it on any kind of Android-based mobile device. Then a subscription becomes essential and worthwhile in order to take full advantage of everything &#34;Office 365&#34; has to offer. Recommended.34; features at their fingertips.<br /><br />Is &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; worth the money spent on a subscription?

1,No complaints - well worth the price.
0,"This was the clunkiest program (of any kind) that I've used in a long time! Yes, it was possible to transfer info from last year's Turbo Tax file and I'm assuming that calculations are accurate but beyond that, navigation through the program was awkward, and back tracking to double check input/information flow to 1040 was so frustrating that I kept wondering who I was punishing for switching from Turbo Tax. I certainly hope Intuit has seen the light so I can revert to Turbo Tax for 2015!"
1,"its great.had no problems downloading and using the software.amazon qas the cheapest,and i didnt have to leave to go and get it."
1,I have been using TurboTax for over 20 years.  It has gotten very expensive but still works great.
1,This is the only internet security we use at my home and work. It was a suggestion from my son-in-law.
1,"I have had Avast for a long time. It keeps my screen clean.and on top of scammers, unwanted ads and more.."
1,"I have been trying to reinstall since I had to do a system restore ( crash) It sends you in circles to get started.. then you have no download... then sign in again.... never order a download... IN THE HAND AT THE STORE ONLY!!<br />*******<br />******* Finally got a hold of Microsoft support, they did correct the issue so I am increasing to 4 stars"
1,"I've tried many of the editing packages out there and unless you know a lot about how cameras work and the associated terminologies stick with Picasa.  I wanted something that was not cloud based to use.  This one is about as simple as they get, as far as having explanatory menus and support from Forums and the company."
1,good
0,"I have used this product for several years. However, this year it did not work.  Once downloaded, I started to do my taxes.  The program required updating, which I was unable to do, after several tries, including restarting the computer three times.  The final straw was that it was unable to import a 1099 document from my bank.  At this point, I gave up and purchased Turbo Tax."
0,Having some issues with it. Trying to work it out. I almost feel this is a waste of money.
1,"While I feel I am a Quicken expert.....used it for 15-20 years, most of those years was on a PC.  The story is different for Mac.  Not as friendly or easy to use.  Some of the features that I was easily able to 'turn on' with the PC, I can't even find on the Mac.  Somewhat disappointed but still going to use it!  All you pros, find a way for it to work just like on the PC!"
0,I wish I had never purchased this product. You would think such a sophisticated tool could create a simple annual budget and track expenses against that budget but it cannot. This is useless to me.
0,"I can't even download it and I just bought the damn software. Apparently, I don't qualify for a refund! It's not worth buying, don't waste your time! I've been buying Norton software every year and I started 2 years ago.. This is the third year and this is the first time Amazon gave me issues."
1,"As far as free software goes, it's very impressive. It does pop up at least once a day and make noises (&#34;Avast Virus Database has been updated&#34;) and with the occasional other annoying notification, but it functions quite well. I haven't had any virus problems since I got it."
1,I've been using Turbo Tax since the mid 90's. It's an excellent product. I don't buy into e-file & prefer to print & mail my returns. Because tax laws are always changing it seems like you almost want to wait until late March to file in order to get the latest updates.
1,"There was a coupon code that made this program a stellar deal. My daughter, who is 7, absolutely loves the program. She is using correct finger placement, and even posture, to learn how to type completely on her own. I love that she is able to use it without any guidance from me. She plays it frequently without prompting because she thinks it is so fun. It was simple to download and she was able to use it quickly. I am very pleased."
1,"Awesome - runs in background w no problem.  Easy set up with sensible options that even a little-experienced computer user can understand.  Great notifications, but only when it makes sense (not overdoing or underdoing it).  So much better than the competitors p-a-i-d services!!!!"
1,"I've been using it for the past 4 years now never had a problem, low resources, best antivirus out there, and it's free"
1,"I have been using this product as an alternative to Acrobat. It works very well and is faster. It is also a whole bunch cheaper. Rendering seems to be very accurate; no problems so far despite a complex mix of text and images. Markup and other document manipulation tools are just fine.<br /><br />I'm not a super power user. I need to render images and Word documents as PDFs for training purposes and public posting on our intranet site, and so that they cannot be altered. This products works just great, and is a whole bunch cheaper than Acrobat. Straightforward functionality and price are  its main selling point.  I can't speak to very, very high end functionality such as forms creation or other complex tasks."
1,"Quickbooks is easy to use but very powerful accounting tool. Many different types of reports. Easy to do payroll. Very helpful in preparing various tax forms, W2, 1099, EDD.<br />Handles depreciation schedule information for assets<br />Transaction input is like writing a check"
0,"I have been trying to download this product since I bought it about a month ago. IMPOSSIBLE. the program keeps telling will take about 3 hrs, then 8 hours and so forth. I am sorry that AMAZON keeps selling this product without warning their customers the risk they take. TO BAD AMAZON"
1,Best free antivirus i have found
1,"Avast is an excellent product, very reliable. I love it!  A friend at work recommended it me years ago and I have used it ever since then."
0,"The software did an adequate job of compiling a simple tax return, however there customer service is poor at best.  I purchased a second state for $39.99 and could not get it to load after completing the purchase.  I called their customer service line and, after describing my problem, the person I spoke to said they needed to &#34;transfer me to another department&#34; but instead simply hung up --- dial tone.  I called back and got the same routine with someone else, but when they tried to &#34;transfer&#34; me I told him not to do that because I was hung up on last time.  He told me to hold and he would get his supervisor to help me, he then proceeded to hang up on me -- dial tone again.<br /><br />If I got hung up on once, I could believe it's a bad apple or someone who had a bad day. Getting hung up on twice indicates this is is simply part of the Intuit culture; in a word: worthless.  But you live and learn and move on.  There are a number of other tax preperation software packages which I'll get looking into for next year"
0,I have used turbo tax for years. The price has always been in the $30 range until last year there was a significant increase in pricing. Then along comes 2014/2015. Now instead of buying deluxe I am forced to buy premier for double the cost of deluxe!  Phooey that. I think turbo tax will be losing customers in droves.  I will go to filing manually before I will pay $70 for tax software. What were they thinking!  And as to the parent company name of intuit seems a misnomer on so many levels. The program itself is mistake prone when it comes to schedules E and D and as to the intuition on their marketing strategies; well there was an epic fail there.
1,Work fine
1,Good product and fast service. I like the fact that you can download it directly to your pc. Thank you.
1,This worked exactly like I needed it to. I was looking for a way to convert .mov to .avi files for a class and this did it perfectly. It was very easy to install and converted the files really fast. I was expecting it to take a while to convert but this had my clips done in about 30 seconds. I am very happy I bought this
0,"I won't launch into the overall details, but overall I was extremely disappointed in the quality and quantity of features. It's 2012 and Quicken is still trying to eek out every last penny they can get with very little innovation. Switched to mint.com and will never, ever buy Quicken again."
1,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first: yes, it's unfortunate that Intuit has been de-contenting TT for years now, this year to the point that TT 'Deluxe' is no longer suitable for those with even the most basic investment income. So much for &#34;Deluxe&#34;; maybe they should come up with a better naming system to go along with their changes. I knocked a star off the review for this reason, since this is a yearly incremental updated product, and removing features YoY is pretty bad practice and a blatant lazy attempt to improve profits.<br /><br />I ONLY took one star away because, frankly, it's still easy to use and it works (when you buy the appropriate level package). I spent days and days trying with a competitor's (cheaper) software, which badly mishandled some of my investment income, resulting in a situation where I'd have to manually override much of the return, and lose the ability to e-file entirely. For under $60, TT Premier had a properly sorted Federal return ready for me in about 2 hours. Yes, that's about twice what the other software cost me, but I'd gladly pay the price again to get back the hours I spent fighting with the cheaper competitor's product.<br /><br />I hope Intuit reverses course in future years, or at least stops pulling content from their intermediate level products, because they really are useful and get the job done."
0,"I was atracted by the price of this antivirus, I wasnt really needing one because my computer was working fine, but to protect my pc, I decided to order and download this antivirus. First, after It was installed in my pc, I noticed it was a basic antivirus, something that It wasnt explained in the description. Also I read some of the reviews of people saying that it burned their computers, I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THOSE REVIEWS! after installing that antivirus, my laptop started acting up, and a couple times my hard drive started to shut down and the computer fixed some damages bla bla bla... So after a few weeks, and my computer continued acting up, until one day it didnt work anymore... I had to take it to an expert that told me that the hard drive was burned.. I lost important files, even though I could recover some files. But instead of getting a real antivirus and spend some extra bucks I ordered this fake crap that burn my hard drive... I had to buy a new one and I ended up spending more money...<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE OTHER REVIEWS DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,I have a computer that is getting slower and wanted to preserve my photos and documents in case it is necessary.  Simple to use and access.
0,A complicated for a beginner.
1,Very easy to use.  Like the way it walks you through everything as needed.  Have been using for many years and have had no problems.
0,"I cannot comment on the TurboTax software itself because after numerous attempts to download this version as well as emails and phone calls to Amazon I have been unable to complete the download. I always receive the same error message: Gateway Error 810. A little research on the interweb leads me to believe that software & game download problems are common when purchased from Amazon. I would think that Amazon's support would address these complaints and take appropriate actions. Until then, I will avoid future software purchases. Amazon did refund my money however."
1,This was an easy download and is a good product to use.  I have been using TurboTax for a number of years and believe it is the best.
1,"I have used TurboTax for the past 10 years or so. I usually get it at Costco or one of the BigBox stores. This year I was extra lazy and waited until April 14 to do my taxes. I downloaded, installed, updated and completed my taxes on time! Having the eFile for Federal and State is a BIG plus!"
1,"We've had other anti-virus programs in the past, some quite expensive, but they never kept our computers free of infections.  We've used the Avast free for three or four years with not a single infection.  I'm feeling guilty because they're doing such a good job and I'm taking a free ride.  As soon as we get some medical bills paid down I'm investing in their full anti-virus program."
0,"I have used Turbo Tax faithfully for over 20 years.  This year I feel the company (Intuit) broke faith with their users.  I have always bought the deluxe level of software and it met all my needs.  This year Intuit decided to change the mix, and what was previously offered for deluxe users was no longer available.  Why did they do this? Who knows.  I feel that whomever came up with this marketing strategy should be shown the door, and the CEO/President of the company should make financial restitution to the many users that have been disappointed by this turn of events.  Hopefully Intuit has learned a valuable lesson here and figured out it is not wise to mess with what was considered a very successful product."
1,Works very well!!And its FREE!!!
1,It's very good anti virus software
1,"I used Quicken more than 8 years ago and switched over to MS Money.  I've used MS Money up until it was discontinued this year.  I have to say that Quicken has come a long way.  One of the things I like best is the transaction downloading.  There are many more services offered in Quicken than in MS Money, and some that I had to download manually are supported by the package.  It saves me hours a month.  The financial planner and investment tracker are as good as MS Money.   Overall worth the buy.    BTW, I'm a Mac user and was really hoping for a full fledged package on the Mac.  Quicken Essentials is a joke, a waste of money and time.  You are better running this package in a virtual machine than to use Essentials."
1,Turbo Tax has made tax preparation easier and more understandable each year.  E- Filing greatly speeds up the process.
1,It is nice to be ablexto email once again but I hate that they hold you hostage with this feature. Essentially forcing you to upgrade every few years.
1,I've used TurboTax for quite a few years to do my taxes and I have never had a problem with it.  It is very easy to use and has tax experts that you can consult if needed.  Would recommend this product to anyone.
0,"Words cannot describe how disgusted and frustrated I am with this completely worthless piece of garbage. I have spent hours trying to get it to work on a win7 dell laptop. I am a professional Network Administrator, and I can not get it to function. Every time I try it simply says Upgrade Failed. That's it!!!! There are a billion suggestion online; none of them work. Don't waste your time with this unsupported money pit. I feel violated."
0,"I used TT to file home business taxes last year as the price was reasonable and I heard good things about the software. I was ready to do so again this year until hidden costs nearly doubled the cost. I can hire a professional for not much more to do my taxes for the cost of TT. Most importantly Intuit did not clearly list cost but incorporated the added cost in what I consider a highly deceptive manner. Bottom line Intuit Turbo Tax has NO loyalty to their clients placing greed much higher in priority than taking care of the people that made the company successful. Shame on Intuit!!!!!<br /><br />Update: I called the worthless 800 number. It is a feeble attempt to rectify a horrible business decision. I got an automated recording that didn't offer much (a small discount back to normal pricing) why would I deal with this hassle when I can use other tax services that work just as well for 30% less...I am using H&R Block and find it just as easy, accurate and much more affordable."
0,"Since I purchased it and down loaded, I updated it with the key words provided by the order into the Update Center in Norton. However, they answered from time to time to say the key words is unavilable or no longer cause this is older version. We can not update it by your download software. Please give me an idea of how to succeed for update it.<br /><br />--James"
0,Download failed - Adobe's help is awful.<br /><br />I paid for this and I do not think I can get it to work.  No way to get a refund.<br /><br />Don't dbuy it!
1,New convert to Quicken so I haven't dealt with upgrading but so far it does everything I need and more.
1,We have been using quicken for years- and find it so helpful & easy to navigate!
0,Same issue with everyone else- system failed to sign me in with my amazon credentials.
1,"I had not updated Quicken in several years and was surprised in the changes.  I tried to use another free financial software that high recommendations but it was a big disappointment.  All I use the program for so to balance my checking and savings accounts so don't need all the extras.  That is why I had not updated, but after having to change to Windows 8 I was forced to.  I have used Quicken for many years and it seems to be a very good program."
1,"I was really angry when my version of Photoshop 6.2 quit working on windows ME or Vista not sure it was years back, I really loved that software and though I did try a few versions of inexpensive Adobe products in the past, none has come close to what I had in that software that MS took away by not allowing older software to migrate to their new OS I think I was running XP at the time but wasn't too happy that a pretty expensive bit of software was gone because of MS decided to make their not make their OS backward compatible.   Anyway It took a few years and a few sub-par products to finally find something that works as well or nearly as well as that old software did, but there are allot of are inexpensive replacements these days. In fact shareware and freeware products have gone comercial and are charging as much or more than this version of Adobe imaging software, and honest I find that hard to beliieve.   I bought the download becuase I needed something fast to import and fix some old photo's ( for safety reasones I saved it to my external hard drive just incase something happens to this machine or I buy a new PC ), but after a few hours playing with this software and I'm pretty happy, it made the correction in faded yellow photo's I wanted it to do, and for the money... forget it. Compared to the other two imaging software packages I've purchased recently this is like going from a decent shareware product to a solid photo imaging platform again.   I know we have our own favorites, and there's allot of opinion concerning these products, but in this case I've been expecting to spend allot of money and found this package to do just about everything my old ful version of Photoshop did, plus it has some features that the old Photoshop didn't have ( primarily concerning digital imagery ) so I'm very happy, and would recommend this product to anyone I know with no hesitation or concerns that they might find it lacking perticularly for the money."
0,earlier versions were more user friendly.product sometimes confusing and inconsistent
1,Bought as an update for Quicken 2012. Update process was stemless. Works fine on my computers.
1,"This product was ready to download and install, and it's free. It automatically updates the virus database and speaks to me to let me know it's done that."
1,"Have been using Turbo  Tax for over 10 years with great success, my daughter started doing my taxes and 4 years ago I decided to try it on my own. I can't believe how friendly and easy you make it for us who don't like trying new things and venturing out of the box.<br />All my children and grand-children use Turbo Tax every year and we all are happy.<br />Thank you Turbo Tax for making life easy for us.<br /><br />Beatriz Rowe"
0,"Horrible! Wouldn't let me install 'state' on a computer that someone else installed a different state on earlier, without trying to charge me again."
1,This anti virus is also a great product!  I had no problems with it.  It also was easy to download and use.
1,It is good. I haven't had any problem with it. Does what it claims to do. Creating bulletins and newsletters.
1,"It is a good product and works like it should... like every computer program, there is a learning curve to using it...I know I don't use all the features that are available on it, but for keeping books on my vet clinic, it is compatible with Avimark for the most part and I really can't complain."
0,My creations looked like a 3rd grader made it.  Not at all what I wanted to represent my business.  I ended up having a professional create my logo.  That being said this would be great for a project for your kids or the like.
1,"I use for several years, I changed from norton/roxio goback and since them has saved me hours of work to repair software errors or drives, especially in the windows XP, but is more reliable than the windows system restore and more versatile. I recommend, particularly those with children playing on computers."
1,"My second updated to the quicken 2015., it can display and managed my money where to spent ... Also, I can plan my budget and vacation."
1,"I find that any tax software makes doing taxes so much easier (even though mine are really simple, I pay the $ for reassurance).  TurboTax and H&R Block are pretty much the same to me, but aside from those 2, I don't trust others.  I usually wait at least until late March or early April to get the software because it's cheaper if you wait, but this is a great deal, about 30% less than buying it directly from TurboTax, and TurboTax 2012 is even more user-friendly than in past years."
0,"I used the free version of AVAST for a while then paid for the upgraded version for a few years. Then they offered a new product called Grime Fighter and I think the name says it all. It will clean all the grime left behind by programs you have removed that always leave something behind, cookies that get into your system from various websites you visit and so on. Grime Fighter seemed to be doing all that it promised, it took hours to analyze and clean my computer until one day it stopped working. I called AVAST, I spent time submitting a ticket with a description of my problem and finally got someone on the phone that told me if I allowed them access to remotely access and take control of my computer they would see if they could find the problem. I allowed them to do it and was told that my computer had a lot of junk (GRIME) and many suspected virus files and for $179 they would have tech support take control of my computer and clean it all up and get my paid for GRIME FIGHTER working again. After I paid, I sat and watched my computer screen for about an hour or so and saw that something was happening and felt secure that all would be fixed and I would have a nice clean faster computer again. When they were done, I ran Grime Fighter again and it failed exactly as it had before. After looking into it again AVAST informed me that GRIME FIGHTER would not work on my computer. They also told me that I had mistakenly subscribed to Grime Fighter twice and after a few more phone calls and submitting another ticket offered a refund for the second subscription but not the first even though Grime Fighter will not work on my computer any longer. I also made several phone calls and submitted tickets for a refund for the $179 + tax $192 which they refused. So I paid for antivirus that didn't prevent viruses, I paid for Grime Fighter that stopped working, I paid for Tech Support with no results and all in all spent well over $200 for nothing but headaches. If that sounds like funto you, sign up and enjoy the ride. If not, find another service that has a better reputation and be sure to read the fine print before signing or paying."
1,Wonderfully satisfied
1,"i have used this software for over ten years. easy to update and excellent protection. recommend to everyone, all ages."
1,"About 4-5 years ago I first purchased Cook'n. Until about 3 weeks ago I used it with Complete Satisfaction. Suddenly I lost the Inability to Print from the Application. Every other software continued to allow me to Print. I contacted Cook'n Technical Support and they tried to help me. After several e-Mails back and forth I, in frustration, Deleted Cook'n.& contacted the IT person who helped me to reinstall the Program without any charge and I am pleased to say that I can print again & was able to rescue all of my Recipes"
1,Avast antivirus is a &#34;no strings attached&#34; free antivirus package that is updated frequently.  I  have utilized this for over 18 months and have had no problems.  Upgraded packages are available.
1,We have been using this at many different locations for years and works just how you would need something like this to work.
0,I was looking for a software that I could back up my DVD collection. I have used a couple of cyberlink softwares in the past and they seemed really solid. I also needed a virtual drive to mount iso's and .cue files. Well it worked the first DVD I converted to an ISO. could play it on the virtual drive. I then waited a month. After a month I tried to start it and was met with a blank screen. No loadup nothing. looked at my processes still running in the background. I uninstalled it which was a pain because i could not get the process to stop in the back ground without much frustration. Still did not work.
1,"As always, just the best writing program out there, MS word will never beat it."
1,"I have bought the program for the last few years and am always impressed with the knowledge of the program, the updates, the help and all.  It is very relaxing to be able to do taxes at your own leisure and know it has been done right."
1,works well
0,I have found it very difficult to transition between the old Word and the new.  I took the little training video.  But still find it difficult.
1,It is working good
0,"Disappointing to have to pay an additional $19.99 to e-file the state return.  Seems like this year Intuit made the business decision to nickle and dime their customers.  I will probably go another direction next year.  Otherwise, the software worked just fine as in previous years that I have used it."
1,"One of the personal reasons I like avast! Free Antivirus is that if I want to go offline & play games - or run a defragging program,etc. I can disable some of avast's shields for various periods of time.<br /><br />So far I have been virus-free since beginning use of avast."
0,"On the surface, its a great product but obviously their firewalls are not what they state as our identity was compromised and we were victims of tax fraud."
1,Have used this tax software for years and it consistently works very well for those of us with fairly complicated tax situations (overseas).
0,"I initially downloaded this app to be a format translator between Pages and Word, but it didn't exactly do what I wanted. Formatting between the two got wonky, so any files I worked on in Pages and wanted to export as a .doc would open fine in OpenOffice, but once saved, formatting still looked funny when I opened the file in Word. Plus, the latest available file type to save as in OO was MS Word 97-2000, which is probably why there might have been formatting issues (since I was trying to prep the files to be opened in Word 2010). It's okay for a free download though; it at least gave me a glimpse as to what the converted Pages file might look like in Word."
1,Have used Norton Antivirus for several years.  Computer is on most of the time and have never received a virus.
1,"Good product. Very similar to other versions in terms of functions, but with a slightly enhanced layout. Excel is more streamlined. The subscription is new, as opposed to a traditional unlimited license for more money."
1,"Like: Imported prior TT easily with no mistakes.  Can do multple family members simple returns. The GUI has improved over the years<br /><br />Dislike:  I need to file in 2 states (I live in one and work in another) and the price for a second state is too high $40 and must buy direct from TT, not Amazon"
1,Great product. I have used since early DOS days. It now is a far more comprehensive product but is far more than I need. Just want  check register and download from bank at a good price.
1,Over a decade of reliable service!
1,the client for XP sp3 did fail to Install....
1,"I have used TurboTax every year now for about 15 years. This is the first time I've ordered it as a download, and I was very pleased. I never really knew what to do with the disks once I was done with our taxes. I didn't want to throw it away just in case, but yet it wasn't something I thought I'd ever use again.  Getting the download version took care of that problem, eliminated waste, and if I need it again, it's available.<br /><br />One note: The section for completing the Schedule C was a bit confusing, but it is the first time I've had to do one, so that might be the problem. Although, it would have been nice if TurboTax did not assume that everyone understood everything. There were areas where I would have liked more explanation, but there wasn't any help. There were other areas that I didn't need help with, but there was help available.<br /><br />Still, I will not use another tax program, unless I decide to have an accountant do my taxes."
0,"Was unable to install it on one computer; however, after many telephone conversations with tech support, they were able to replace it on my computer with an application that worked."
0,"I WISH I HAD KEPT MY 2010 VERSION OF QUICKEN. EVERY TIME I PAY A BILL ON LINE WITH MY BANK, IT GETS ENTERED TWICE IN MY QUICKEN BANK REGISTER SO I HAVE TO DELETE ONE OF THEM TO KEEP THE CHECKING ACCOUNT BALANCE CORRECT."
0,"This product gets zero stars, they are forcing me to give it one star.  Do not buy it.  One of the most aggravating experiences I have had in years.  Spent four hours today working on this, two hours with tech support, to find out there is some kind of problem that would not allow Quciken to download my data.  I am going to try Ace Money."
1,"I teach, work in the learning center lab and take classes in a local community college. I purchased a Creative Cloud yearly membership about 6 weeks ago and so far I haven’t had any problems. I downloaded Lightroom, Photoshop, Dreamweaver and a couple other programs. I have used older versions Photoshop and Dreamweaver in the past. It will take a year or two to learn to use the programs I am interested in.<br />I do have some concerns about buying this software online. My biggest fear is, what will Adobe charge to renew the contract next year and will I have a reasonable chance to prevent the renewal of the contract if I choose to do so? My other concern is how responsive will Adobe be if I do have a problem. Because of my consternation, I will hold my rating to a four star. If everything goes well for the next year, I’ll give Adobe a five star."
1,"I can understand the negative comments on this app, initially it is not totally clear what it does. This application is essentially a game tracking service that works across all platforms and combines your gamer stats into one neat package. It is also a messenger, with chat, friends list, email and all kinds of other mostly useless things. It also happens to have a unique reward system which uses the built in tracker to determine eligibility for various prizes such as free games (a few good ones so far), digital in-game items or beta access to an upcoming game. The reward system is fun but sometimes the rewards seem like ads or promos instead of actual rewards. I did get two free xbox live arcade games and starcraft 2 beta access so with a little patience, good rewards can be earned. In my opinion, most of the value in this program comes from the stats and the tracker. I have always found personal stats interesting; I have been meticulously scrobbling my music since 2008 just to keep a record of my listening experience. You can do something similar with Raptr, using it to compare your stats against other players, friends and community leaders. I was surprised to see how good I am at certain games and how bad at others I had put way too much time into. All in all, it is a fun app that works along side Steam, PSN, XBLA and more to provide you with more information on your gaming habits and history."
0,Does not work well on an iPad .
0,"H&R Block tax software prompted us with a lot of questions that did not pertain to us - which is ok if not for the fact that it did not prompt us for forms and schedules that we did need to fill. Fortunately, my wife is quite knowledgeable about taxes and we were able to locate the appropriate forms within this software. We will try different software next year."
0,For the second straight year I was unable to file electronically simply because Turbo=tax was unable to make a copy of my return prior to executing the electronic filing stage of it's procedure
0,I am studying Federal Income Tax preparation.  So I bought this program to read it back to me so I can stay awake.  Actually I use it to simulate a lecture. Then I re-read the material.  The program functions OK.  I'd give it a grade of C.  You still know that it is a computer program &#34;reading&#34; to you.  My advice is to shop some more to see if there is a better program.
1,I have never installed a program like this that does exactly what they say it will do.  It has sped up my old desktop computer greatly. I has caught hundreds of problems on my computer and given it new life.
1,"Very user friendly, excellent at covering all applicable tax situations I had..."
1,"So many functions, so little time. The more I use the full version, the more uses I find for all the tools and conversion capabilities to make life so much easier. Thank you Adobe....just lower the price a bit!!!"
1,"I'm not familiar with a lot of these programs, but this one has made my job hunt much easier. It has everything that you need in the resume broadcast function to get a good looking resume out to the over 1000 resume sites. It also allows you to do a job search and pull in the data from multiple job sites as opposed to going to each site and running a job search. This is all on top of a resume writer that gives you multiple resume examples and the ability to look up key phrases that pertain to your industry and job type."
1,"Much more user friendly than Kaspersky, which is what I was using for about the last 5 years."
0,"About the software:<br />Software is simple, but it's a PDF viewing/editing software, completely overpriced, Find something cheaper dropping $100 or more on software, just to be licensed to view and &#34;kinda&#34; edit documents is ridiculous. There's free software that will do the same thing. I regret purchasing and dealing with this company.<br /><br />About Adobe:<br />Why? Why? WHY!?! Did I ever think that dealing with them would be an easy or present experience? It is like they designed a specific torture device to lure you in and then rob / rape you again and again! They do not have good customer service, they make the activation process as lengthy, complicated, and personal hell like as possible, and they charge you a price far exceeding the value of their product. My recommendation: Never deal with this company.... Ever!<br /><br />The Truth:<br />You buy their over priced software, and then make you jump through a bunch of hoops, try to get as much personal info on you as possible (In order to &#34;verify&#34; your identity). Guess what adobe, it's none of your business and you just got hacked and had all those personal file stolen."
0,"If we had a simple tax situation, this software would be good.  But if we had a simple tax situation, we wouldn't be using tax software, so this software is not the type of help that we needed.  I found the rentals and royalties section to be very confusing, because I couldn't tell what I was entering where. To be fair, I asked for a chat with my questions, and in 2 out of 3 chats, I got very thorough, accurate and positive chats. I don't think I'll buy this software next year.<br />Is it just me, or is it crazy that we not only have to pay tons in taxes, but we have to pay tons to figure out how much we owe, tons to download more than one state, and tons to e-file.  Good grief."
0,"I do not like this version as well as my older 2006. I do not like the way the register is set up. It does not include all the items on the main screen like the older did. You have to put in a negative amount when writing a debit to the account. Adding the options you need, all to one line, make the entries too wide, and do not show on the screen.They run off so you cannot read them.<br />  In using the portfolio for Iras, it does not have a individual listing for the items in each. It does not show the shares amounts or their pricing. The way items are saved has me with two different dollar figures neither of which is correct."
1,User friendly program that is easy to set up and easy to use. Clean look! Good value if you don't need something as powerful as quickbooks.
0,"Best windows ever?  HA!<br />This is is far from the best windows ever.<br />MS seems to want to make everything it put out worse and worse.<br />Now they want to make your computer, look like you phone, look like your tablet, look like your XBOX ONE...<br />This is not progress, this is trying to use the same shoes to go dancing, and run a mile, and ride horses, and go swimming...<br />There is a reason we have different things for different uses - you don't ride your motorcycle through a car wash, and you don't drive your camper into the lake to go fishing.<br /><br />Win 10 has the same feel as Win 8/8.1 so if you liked that, you may not dislike it as much as I do.<br />For me personally, I had just got a new laptop, and when the roll-out date hit I went for it.  Less than a week later I rolled it back.<br />I could go into all kinds of nit-picky details, but at the end of the day the drivers wouldn't even run my bluetooth.  I had run the update tool, and it said everything would be cool - but two weeks with no fix, and I had enough.  BT is pretty common, and Qualcomm Atheros is too.  Can't believe there was not native support.<br /><br />For me, bad looks, bad function, and the old axiom is true again.  You get what you pay for, and this was free..."
1,This is a safe download without attached adds or viruses.
1,"I used to have an accountant do my taxes. I actually got money back the past two years because of TurboTax. I was initially apprehensive about doing them myself, but TurboTax walks you through every single item. It asks you simple questions and when you've answered them all, you're done. It even comes up with a colored assessment (Green-Yellow-Red) about the possibility of getting audited. TurboTax guarantees it's results. If you are really concerned, for something like $30 you can purchase an insurance from them and they will take care of any and all audits by the government."
0,"Background - I run a small service company with 12 employees and approximately 1000 clients. We send out approximately 450 invoices each month. I have been in business for 5 years. I and my staff have used quickbooks for 14 months. We use it for accounting, billing, payroll, and credit card processing services. I should say we did use it. After the past 14 months of shear frustration and near murder at the hands of my staff on numerous occasions I am stopping this nightmare.<br /><br />I have been using the internet and computers since approximately 1994. My equipment, software, and operating systems are all new within the past 1week-3 years. I have 4 computers, 2 tablets, and build and maintain my own websites. Never since '94 have I run across software or a company that is as horrible as Intuit and Quickbooks.<br /><br />Specifically:<br /><br />1.) They update their software regularly and it causes problems. Certain functions will disappear for hours or days on end after these updates. If you call they try to make you sign up for a phone help service plan which is outrageously expensive for a small business - mind you to talk with them about problems they have with their software that their updates created. When the problems arise we have changed nothing on our end, no program installs, no changed settings, we do nothing differently, the only change is their update. If/when they ever admit it is their problem they say it will sometimes takes a couple hours to days for the changes to propagate through their system and the functions to be restored. Which is fine and all unless you are actually running a business where people pay you money and you can't randomly shut down shop whenever Inuit decides to do an update... No joke this has happened no less than 15 times in the past 14 months.<br /><br />I have found voodoo dolls with my likeness and horrible things done to them in my staffs desk's. Ironically I am always holding a copy of Quickbooks in my hands in theserenditions.<br /><br />2.) Our invoices don't credit correctly or show up at all sometimes. This happens 4-10 each month and makes us look incompetent and dishonest to our customers when they pay and it doesn't register in our system... Again, we are using all quickbook and intuit systems. It works great most of the time, and you look like a complete fool the other times. Payments will get deposited by intuit, most of them register, some of them don't.<br /><br />3.) They will hold your software and information hostage if you don't renew their yearly subscription. Essentially if you don't pay them around $500/year then the software is useless. That figure doesn't include the price of their glorious phone support either.<br /><br />4.) You don't buy software so that you can spend 5 days each year of your life on phone support with the company trying to get the software to work correctly or consistently. Or maybe you do, someone out their must like the tech support hold music right?<br /><br />The short of the story is a simple search found other companies that provide the exact same services for much less money. In fact you will find an excel spreadsheet more enjoyable and functional that Quickbooks. For the sake of decency and all humanity please don't waste your money on this software. Only a fool would pay to give themselves a headache - not to mention become the target of all your employees evil glares whenever accounting, billing, or the evil Q world are mentioned.<br /><br />I have seen the light and realized the error in my ways. I will no longer be abused by Intuit or Quicbooks. I am breaking the cycle. Please contact me if you would like to join the support group for those suffering from the torturous effects from interacting with Intuit and their Quickbooks software, payroll and billing services. FINAL THOUGHT: If you can imagine the worse case of diarrhea ever, now move that insanity from the south end up to your brain. That would be just a minuscule amount of discomfort compared to what you are about to encounter when you work with Intuit/Quickbooks."
1,"Was able to recover and use my 2007 database after loading the newer version.<br />It did what was expected, without any problems."
0,"....and I'm a software developer, so that's saying something.  I've used Quickbooks for many years and I always thought it was great software.  Now that they make me upgrade every three years, I like it a lot less because I need absolutely none of the new features that I'm forced to pay for.  But the final straw was the 2014 upgrade which was completely revamped from 2011.  It's terribly buggy (for example, to email invoices to my clients, I have to exit the application and restart it between each email or the software crashes).  And the new interface is so kludgey and awkward.  I used to be able to see the full account names of my accounts on the Company Home page, but now the font is so large that the names are truncated.  Plus, you can't adjust the frame sizes and you can't make the text larger or smaller.  I've tried several of the new features, but they don't do anything for me.    I'm actively looking for a different company to handle my payroll and then I will happily stop using Quickbooks.  I would tell anyone who asks - don't buy this version of QB!"
0,disappointed in the elimination of the free state filing.
1,"I can't really give this a fair rating because I rarely used it before  I found a terrific buy on Microsoft's Office bundle of Word, Excel. Power Point, and One Note that I just could pass up!"
1,Very easy to use. Taxes in no time!
0,"I'd like to review it but it won't instal. Goes through all the motions, say's it's complete and finishes. No icon, no EXE file, NOTHING!"
1,It wasn't hard to download and install. The link could of been made to be seen easier but the program its self dose its job. Dose not slow down my computer performance and I know I have something that will protect my computer from those dirty viruses on the net.
1,Keeps my computer running smooth.
1,This is an excellent improvement on the previous versions. It's a must for anyone getting into photography. It will make up for what you missed on the shot.
1,Have had no problems since installing late 2013.
0,Amazon.com asked for your credit card number and the code. Downloaded but found it is just for 30 days trial.<br />I spent almost an hour to register at Corel and all failed. Precious time have been wasted.
0,I use this to replace the 2010 version that was losing download support.  Easier to stay with Quicken than to learn a new program.<br />There's good and bad...
0,It does not allow to insert pictures and not easy to use. It is very basic. I was using another software but I bought a new computer and old software was not compatible and the new version of that software is more expensive (Nitro pdf pro) and I did not want to spend the money. IF you want something good spend more money to buy something that is easy to use and make sense
1,"The only three for sure things in life are death, taxes and H&R Block is better than Turbo Tax!  It has the same basic interview process and all the forms you need to file taxes with itemized deductions. Much less expensive than bait-n-switch Turbo Tax too. It read in Turbo Tax file from 2013 with no issues!  You won't be disappointed!"
1,Great
1,I like Avast Anti virus for its simplicity. It protects my computer amazingly well...<br />Avast is the best. OMG!!! Y
1,"Norton Internet Security 2012 is a continually updated product which operates without glitches or processor encumbrance. It does it's job quietly in the background, only alerting you if an issue is found. I have used Norton/Symantec products for many years and they only get better. Support or product update is only a click away! Identity Safe, a perk of using this product, eliminates the headache of trying to remember many passwords. All are encrypted within the software and accessed and made available with an Identity Safe initial logon. It gets no easier than this! I highly recommend this product to cover all of your PC's security bases!"
0,"Gets the job done.  Price seems to go up every year.  Help menu's don't always help,.  The review flags errors that it doesn't explain.  Took some web searching to understand what to put in the fields that it was complaining about.  At this price I would expect the product to explain what the entry field is all about.  The Ohio small business form was not included and you had to download it on your own.  Was a very confusing form that turned out to be really simple but the states instructions were terrible.  Too bad TT did not include it in their product with instructions."
0,"I upgraded from 2012 to 2014 and found that there were very few improvements and I lost much of the functionality I had previously enjoyed. Most hot key short cuts (ctl-D; ctl-R, etc) only work occasionally. Customized reports I had created no longer work at all. Reconciling brokerage accounts saves nothing if it is interrupted and it does not realize we usually do this on a monthly basis. In short, it is even more quirky than it has been since I started using it about 10 years ago. The 'one step update' still takes about 3 steps.<br />In short, if you don't need to update because they stop supporting some function, avoid it. If someone knows a good competing product, please let me know. Competition is a good thing."
1,Avast has protected my computer for over two years without a virus intrusion.  It is easy to use and updates automatically every day.
1,"In general, the program serves the purpose I was looking for.  The only issues I am having is it will occasionally double count transactions with credit cards and definitely does not give an accurate overview of my IRA portfolio.<br /><br />If you are looking for something that can get you within range of your net worth, manage daily finances, and take away the need for manual ledger entries, this is a good product.  If your goal is high precision with an entire portfolio, Microsoft still has some work to do."
1,Very good product.  I use it on a yearly basis.  Only downside is that they don't always have the ability to do all the state tax forms online.
1,Perfect
1,Very nice software.
1,This is a great product.  It’s saved me a number of times from being infected by malware.  I highly recommend Avast!
0,"Error-prone, too many bugs, cumbersome. I've since switched to iBank 5.x and am very happy that I did."
1,"If you have a 64 Bit compatible computer, i will recommend you buy the disc version if you want the 64 Bit software on your computer. I tried doing the digital downlad, but it kept saying that the installation failed. I wasnt until i downloaded the 32 Bit version when i didnt have all the problems. i would have preferred to get the 64Bit software, but the 32 Bit doenst seem to have much difference. Overall i wouldnt recommend the digital version."
0,"I'm very disappointed.  Since loading it about a week ago, I've had repeated problems with it failing to open, and, when it does open, its tendency to crash unexpectedly.  I have a brand new computer loaded with Windows 8, the latest version of that operating system.  The articles on the website have been completely unhelpful.<br />Before upgrading to Quicken 2014, I had been using Quicken 2005.  Even though that program is almost a decade old, I'm seriously considering uninstalling the 2014 version and going back to the 2005 program.<br />I do appreciate the ability to sync with a cloud-based data depository, a function that would not be available if I were to go back to the 2005 version.<br /><br />Lawrence J. Siskind"
0,"The product page specifies that this software is compatible with Windows 7. It's not. When you download the software you find out that it's limited to use with XP and Vista only. Do not purchase this product if you have W7, or you'll have to spend an hour working through the customer service process for a refund. UPDATE: It appears that Amazon has now corrected the product description. However, there is another product page showing a similar product that has the same problems. Amazon is usually very good at product descriptions. This is further proof of caveat emptor. The price looked so good I wondered how it could be so cheap. I learned from this experience."
1,Works great on my Mac.  Has all the office programs we need.  Allows me to open email attachments I had probs with before.
0,"Quicken Essentials is a dead-end product. Once you convert you accounts to it, there is no going back, no way to create a QIF file (export file used by Quicken).    As far as using it, it is not as good in features or user ability as Quicken 2007. If you have Quicken 2007 upgrade to either iBank [[ASIN:B00576JM6A iBank 4 for Mac [Download]]] or See Finance, but do not upgrade to Quicken Essentials.    If you have Quicken Essentials bite-the-bullet and get off it ASAP before you have too much financial information to convert to any other personal financial software.    Buying this software and using it was the second biggest mistake I ever-made in my personal computers (the first was choosing a CP/M computer over DOS why back when)."
1,catches stuff none of the others did.  I highly recommend this product.  easy and simple to use with automatic updates.
0,"I had been using Tax Cut for several years now, tried Turbo Tax this year.  it was very difficult to work through the small business / house rental portion of the software.  Generally harder to navigate than Tax Cut, generally didn't like the interface.  Trying to work moving expenses into the software left me frustrated and confused.  I will switch back to Tax Cut next year."
1,Works like it is suppose to!
1,This program is much better than one I spent 300 dollars on. Love the desktop snapshot feature and the program captures the video from my virtual dj program in perfect non distorted recordings of 30 min and longer. Can't say enough great stuff about it so far.
1,"Great software! Like many of you I had been using TurboTax for years but their recent changes prompted me to give H&R Block (formerly TaxCut) another look. The software was just as easy to use for my situation as TurboTax was. I had regular income, investment income, mortgage deductions, and rental property and the Premium edition handled it all fine.<br /><br />As an added bonus H&R Block offers a 10% refund bonus that can be applied to a large amount of store gift cards if you so choose. TurboTax offers something similar but last time I used it you could only get an Amazon gift card. So if you are into the bonus thing H&R Block has a lot more options such as restaurants, retail stores, etc."
1,"Quicken is a good product and does essentially what it is supposed to do, which is track your finances.  I use it for my personal finances only.  I have a business and for it we use Quick Books.  The only thing that I would suggest is that the price is a bit on the high side."
0,"I ordered Microsoft Office 2013, and have had so many problems with it. It took me hours (at least 6) working to get it installed on my computer, and even then was not successfully installed, working well. I need it to be compatible with my Point of Sale program, and it is not, despite it being a very commonly used POS program. I talked to Microsoft about getting a refund, and they said they would refund it. Then when they found out that I ordered it as a digital download from Amazon, they said I need to work with Amazon to get a refund. In talking to Amazon, I was told I cannot get a refund for a Digital Download no matter what.. I sent an e-mail to Amazon about this, and never heard back. It is absurd to pay for a program that does not work. I would be happy to revise a negative about Amazon or Microsoft if a satisfactory resolution could be acheived."
1,I have used Norton for many years . This program has proved to be the best on the market compared to others  that I have used. I won't use any other. I have many friends that now use it because of my referral to them and are also very pleased with it. It seems to get better each and every year that I have had it. Very easy to use and best of all understand.
1,I have been using tax software for years and just discovered I could download the software directly to my computer instead of buying the disc at a higher price at the store
1,I like using Turbo tax and it was very easy. The only thing I was disappointed was you were suppose to get 1 free federal and  i did not get that and had to pay.
1,"I've been using this program for years - it's fabulous! It has kept my laptop virus free. The software update reminder, keeps my computer current."
1,"I bought the 2015 version to replace an older Quicken Started program and what an improvement!  I keep \\""books\\"" for several non-profits and 2015 makes my work so much easier from entry to reconciliation and reports.  There's always (at least in my mind) the question whether software will work with 8.1, but if that's a question of yours, lay it aside ~ works great!"
0,Virus DO NOT BUY
0,Although labelled as TT Business (Mac) the download installed not as TT Business but as TT Premier. Another $10 upgrade was required to make it the Business version: probably because I already had Premier installed. Want money back but don't know how to get it because Amazon has no refund for downloads.
0,I've been a TurboTax Deluxe user for many years but they changed the software this year and will no longer allow you to enter Schedule C or Dividend income without upgrading to higher levels of the software.  I called and they said they would upgrade it for free this year but I would have to pay the higher prices next year.  I just tried H&R Block Deluxe and it works just like this product used to work.
1,We have been using Avast free antivirus on our computers for years with excellent results. Viruses and malware are effectively blocked before making it to the hard drive. Excellent product.
0,I got this because windows movie maker wouldn't play clips without jumping around. This is worse. I take multiple clips during sports games or school dances and put them together and cut out the stuff I don't want to make video's. This just lets you cut things. Has no way to put the videos together. I assumed I would be able to drag the 10 clips onto the board then cut them. NOPE. Just wasted 10$ for a product I wouldn't use if it was free. DO NOT BUY THIS
1,"Used TurboTax for many years until one year I couldn't get it to install. Called their tech support and spend 4 hours on the phone with them trying to resolve the issue, which didn't work. They promised someone higher up would call me back, but that never happened. I switched to H&R Block, and I will NEVER go back. I've used it now for 4 or 5 years and never had an issue. Excellent, easy to use software. Last year I had a very complicated tax issue and called them for tax advice from one of their experts. I called right before tax day (maybe April 13 or 14), and got through to someone within about 5 minutes. They gave me great advice and saved me money. If you think you'll get customer service like that from intuit, just try calling them around April 14th and see how long you're on hold before they even pick up the phone!"
0,Purchased French 1 today and downloaded. Will not come up on my mac book pro running 6.8.6. No way to get any help. Worthless. Should have gotten it on CD I guess. No support available from Amazon or Rosetta.
0,"Ok, need to do self-employed filing, you need this version.  Need to efile, ok, but just for federal.  State efiling costs more.  Yes, I am glad that we don't have to go to H&R block like many decades ago.  The software really makes things easier.  But it would be so much better to pay less and get more."
1,Great product at a great price!!
0,"Purchase of this software was specifically to design a logo.  Very difficult to use and unless you use their predesignated shapes your options are extremely limited. Per Serif.com, there is a 7 day return policy for downloaded software - Amazon.com will not honor. So, if you're thinking of buying this software anyway, I strongly suggest you purchase it directly from the manufacturer."
1,"Each year, it seems like more questions appear about the many possible ways I could have made a dollar.  I'm tempted to take the 5th amendment!"
1,Quicken 2015 is easy to use with accurate calculations.
0,This product was not as described.  The link provided led to a McAfee window which wanted $179.00 for a Total PC check.
0,"I have used Quicken for MANY years and, sadly, I'm less and less satisfied with each successive update. This latest one is the WORST of all ... buggy from the very start (and the bugs aren't minor annoyances, but affect my ability to access my data (such as the program no longer recognizes my password) or to even open the program (a recent update crashed the program and I had to uninstall and reinstall).  I'm simply disgusted.  If I could change to another program without a lot of pain and suffering, I would! I've tried to be understanding and patient, but now I'm simply disgusted ... especially since I was forced to upgrade my Quicken 2012 software by being repeatedly told it would no longer sync with my bank or be supported past this month. I'm keeping my eyes open for another software alternative since, as far as I'm concerned, Intuit has left the door WIDE OPEN for a competitor to come in and grab market share away from Quicken ... the long-time leader in the personal financial management category."
1,IT WORK VERY GOOD AND WORTH HAVING IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD ANTIVIRUS.  IT IS DEFENDABLE WITH YOUR COMPUTER.  YOU CAN GET MORE WITH AVAST BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAID FOR IT.  IT DEPENDABLE.
0,Have been using H&R for 3 years. It allowed me to take energy credit in two years and exceed the federal cap. Well I just got hit with a $500.00 bill and then interest bill from the IRS for exceeding the energy cap. H&R phone rep was NO help. Went to local office and they said sorry but I had to pay it (IRS only gives you three months). The H&R office personnel knew about the cap so the software should have also.<br />Now I have to hire an accountant to do my taxes and review the H&R taxes to see what else H&R overlooked.
1,"I bought this AFTER they changed their policy and allowed you to upgrade to Premier for no extra cost (to handled stocks).  I have used it for many years, and the interface is very good.  I also bought HB Block when I was mad at TT, and it worked okay but not as easy to use at TT."
1,"Norton Internet Security is ranked high by PC Magazine year after year.  It is easy to use and provides excellent protection against viruses and firewall attacks.  The Amazon price can't be beat.  After downloading and installing the Norton software, you need to perform the following step to activate the Norton subscription.  Access Norton and click Support - Enter Product Key.  Enter the<br />Activation Key from the Amazon screen in 5 sets of 5 numbers.  This will activate the software and reset the subscription period to 366 days and stop the expiration popup reminders."
0,"Bait and switch! You have two options on state with premiere: efile and pay much extra, or delete all state info. No way to print and file it yourself. Corporate scumbags... they'll never see another dime from me."
1,"I am a long time Quicken user and have been using Quicken-2003 until my computer broke and I was forced to Window8 that wouldn't install the old version. I didn't take the time to see if I could workaround it and just purchased the new version.<br /><br />I can't say that I notice any difference really but as I liked it, I am not complaining."
1,"I've owned a way earlier version of this program many years ago. It is great for managing budget and expenses. I downloaded it from Amazon, it was like $20.00 cheaper than retail price."
1,"Excellent software.  Updates automatically and works without a hitch with Windows 7, though it had problems with Windows 8 but what and who doesn't?"
1,Right now I'm using 2012 Turbo Tax to help me with year end decisions that will impact my taxes.Previous editions of Turbo Tax have been very helpful when I prepare my tax return and I have no reason this edition will be different.
1,Have been using the free version for 2 years and got this on because you can save addresses  which can't be done with the free version.
1,"Nice, easy to buy!"
0,Every upgrade is a down grade more in user friendly
1,"Great Price and easy to use!  All these virus/firewall programs slow down your browsing experience but, this one is the best I used so far out of many"
0,Was very disappointed that I could not talk with someone on the telephone about a few questions that I had.
0,"Sure glad that I read the reviews before ordering!!! Have used TurboTax Basic for more years than I can remember, but guess that I will need to shop around for something new. This whole mess SUCKS!! Like doing your taxes wasn't bad enough already."
1,"I had a problem with this downloading process, but I found the solution.    The Amazon Games & Software Downloader, a program required to download and install this software, had locked up my computer when I tried to install it. The only way I could get out of this situation was to reboot my computer by pressing the computer's reset button (hard re-boot). After multiple tries without success (including downloading the Amazon Games & Software Downloader many times), I thought that maybe my security software was interfering with the installation. I tried pausing my firewall (Kaspersky) and closing my anti-spyware program (Webroot) before installing the Amazon Games & Software Downloader, but it still locked up my computer during installation.    I searched the Amazon FAQ and other information on Amazon's site for help with this problem, but there is no mention of any software or settings that would be incompatible with the Amazon Games & Software Downloader or that might cause my computer to freeze.    Finally, I found the solution: I uninstalled \\""Webroot Spyware Sweeper\\"" from my computer. Just closing it did not work.    After that I was able to successfully install the Amazon Games & Software Downloader, access my software from my Amazon software Library, and install it without problem. I am happy with the software, and this was the cheapest price I could find for it at this time. I took a star off my rating because the software publisher does not provide a discounted price for repeat customers.     I expect that the software that I bought, TurboTax Home & Business 2009, will be available to me for downloading from my Amazon Software Library if anything goes wrong with my computer (like a hard disk failure) or if I want to upgrade to a new computer or change the computer's operating system. The Library seems straight-forward and easy to use.    My advice to that anyone who is going to purchase and download games or software from Amazon, is that they first download and install the Amazon Games & Software Downloader program successfully. That should minimize any problems."
0,"I hate Intuit.<br />Intuit won't process bank statement data after about three years and forces you to upgrade whether you need it or not. Each time I've gone through this they screw up my account id and I have to go through multiple steps to get my login validated. They repeatedly ask for contact info, even though they already have it. I was surprised to find they have my current and updated credit card info, which I have not given them recently.<br />In this version of Quicken, you cannot use it until you go through all their identification steps."
0,"I won't repeat the information reported by other reviewers.  But here is a message for Intuit:  I've been using TurboTax for decades. Not any more.  Your deceitful removal of features caused me to switch to H&R Block's software.  Thankfully, I could import my TurboTax file from last year so the transition will be seamless.  This should be a case study in how NOT to treat loyal customers."
1,"This is a very basic product. But what it sets out to do ... it does really well. It's one of the very few apps I've come across that has such a consistent feel (and is so stable) across iOS, OSX and Windows versions. Sure the file management involves using a browser and iTunes to handle the iPad bit but it works without any hassle. If you're operating in a mixed environment this app is really handy.  Capture content on the iPad (meeting notes etc) - consume and edit seamlessly in OSX and Windows. Or vice versa ... Originate content (e.g. reference info)on a desktop, Mac or Windows or both, and put it on the iPad via iTunes."
1,"Easy Peasy :) And, somehow the program manages to make you feel like there's a super-nice and patient person helping you out."
1,Works just like the old edition with minor changes. Good product with a fair price.
1,I've officially converted from Turbo Tax. I used it this evening and it was simple and cheaper that TT!
1,This is a very good program if you are willing to spend the time to learn.  I have designed and built several houses using it.  If you are familiar with Broderbunds previous home design software you will have no problem using this.
0,"It works good. What I don't like is ALL the stuff it pops up at computer start up, solicitations etc.. Never used to do that. Now they HOUND YOU for upgrades all the time"
1,Apparently it is different than the regular Corel Draw 7 so it is of no use to me.....because I can't use it with the program that I have that I bought it to go with.  Hmmmm......my fault....not enough research I guess.
1,I've had avast for 5 years now and it is the best antivirus i have had. I've used quite of number of others and they just were not as Avast.
1,I purchased this item because the old version was not eligible for updates.  As always it is a good product but the constant purchase of new versions drives me crazy.  The do a good job with it and my accountant loves it.
0,Leaving Turbotax after 25 years.  This year they doubled the price.  I've been using the Deluxe version.  (Last year I paid $39.95 as an Amazon Prime member.)  This year I need to go to the Home and Business ($80) because I use Schedule C for my professional singing career (as well as needing a K-1 and D).<br /><br />Looks like the H&R Block Premium program ($40) will do it for me.<br /><br />BY THE WAY - also changing from Turbotax Business ($119 - need it because I file a 1041 for a family trust that I manage) to the H&R Block version at $52.00.<br /><br />I've been a loyal Turbotax user since at least 1987.  I was even a beta tester for the MAC version a few years ago.  But this latest stunt is underhanded and smacks of complete disregard for its loyal customer base.  I'm guessing that the large majority of users won't be impacted by this change - so I expect that our voices will be ignored.
1,Works great
1,Far ahead of any other anti-virus. Thank You Avast for being the best. Would take it two to one over any other
1,"They have a good product, but need to stop making changes that can make the software more difficult to use. Keep it simple."
1,I used to have an old Quicken and used an app on my phone and a spreadsheet. With Quickern 2015 I was able to get rid of the app and the spreadsheet. I use the app from quicken and my computer and phone are now synchronized. I tried getting the free credit score but I can not get it to work with the information I added and I got frustrated. Overall I like the program.
1,Avast is the best! Always on the job. Never had an issue with Avast protecting me.
1,"Tax is the way to go for me. I used to use Turbotax, no more though. I was going to use HR block, untill I found out they wanted $40.00 to e file the state.  Tax act at $19.95 to e file both fed & state is compelling value. For like 6.75 they will store your completed tax return for a few years.<br /><br />I had no problems transferring last years taxs from Turbo tax to Tax Act. It is interesting to note that almost any form you need is included free."
0,"I've used Turbo Tax for years.  This year, it won't let me eFile my state taxes (ID) and wasted my time repeatedly taking me around in circles.  It gave me a message that it couldn't eFile because there is an update to turbo tax, but there is none!  Now I'm mailing my forms and having to pay for a secured signature to insure my forms arrived.  I'll rethink using this software next year.  So bummed!"
0,Can't get it to work. I want my $$ back! I had to reinstall 2010
0,"Do not buy. This is the third year that I have installed McAfee on different computers and every year I end up uninstalling the program. Every time I install McAfee, I start having problems with my computer, including this year. I installed McAfee just prior to going on vacation. When I tried to start up my computer at the first hotel, the computer would not load. I had to keep powering down and restarting (5 times). When I finally got Windows to load, it took about 10 minutes to login. Once I was able to login, The computer would not pick up any wireless networks. I uninstalled everything except for virus protection, restarted 3 times and &#34;network connections&#34; finally started to work. I am still having problems and I will de-install McAfee virus protection soon. I DO NOT recommend McAfee."
0,"Don't buy this product.  I tried in a few years ago, and could not get it to connect to my banks. Ok, I thought, they must have this fixed by now. I buy it again and the first bank I try to set up guess what.....It cannot connect. However, it tells me I can put the info in manually! Yeah, that's why I bought an expensive product. I use now MInt. It is free and has never failed to connect to any of the numerous banks, credit card companies and investment houses. Did I mention it is free?"
0,Turbo tax went to the bottom of my list this year.  They have always had the State tax software as part of their Deluxe package.  This year it was not included and they wanted another $40 dollars for it.  This will be my last year using this software.
0,Download does not work - no help offered!
1,"It's been a big time-saver to not longer have to manually enter transactions from my credit card, checking account and brokerage firms!<br />I had alot of trouble when I got this upgrade because my old data file turned out to have a corrupted component that made it impossible to download the transactions.  The Intuit support staff worked with me at length to resolve the problem."
1,WOrks great!
1,"Got fast, just as listed."
1,"This was a replacement of Quicken Deluxe 2009 for me.  Their products are only good for 3 years and then they turn it off and make you buy new software.<br />The transaction was not seamless, but I am paying my bills again. jpe"

1,Love the product.  Amazon could do a better job providing directions on how to download both second and third installs for other computers.  Other than that I am stoked!!
1,Free is for me
1,"I have been a Quicken user almost since the beginning.  If you have been using Quicken Budgets, they have made leaps forward from the previous versions.  This version addresses a lot of the issues.  The year view is great (calendar year versus rolling year).  They have yet to address categories that have mixed accounts assigned to the same category. For example, I have a flexibly spending account where money from my paycheck is deposited and monthly expenses draw from that account.  Quicken does not like this type of transaction.<br /><br />I have discovered some features that I had never seen before.  Some that I have found useful.<br /><br />If you are using budgets you should upgrade.  If you do not budget, you should start."
1,"Very easy, step by step with prompting questions."
1,I am an IT Project Manager and highly recommend AVAST!
0,"The best words to describe is cloogy and unintuitive. I wish they would just have a clear, well written double entry system. I came from using gnucash and was hoping for a more elegant system that would do the same things but better. I will say it never crashed and all the functionalities worked."
1,Works great. Had to upgrade because my past version would not work with system upgrade. This one is fantastice.
1,"I was nervous about upgrading early this year. Last year I upgraded early only to have months of problems syncing, upgrading and dowloading transactions. That was an anomaly in my experience with Quicken, so I set that aside and upgraded anyway. My faith in Quicken upgrades was restored."
0,I have been ripped off!!!! after using the activation code once. I was NOT able to use it on my other two computers. these people need to either give me back my money or give me the activations codes for my other two computers!!!
1,"One of the things I most like about WordPerfect is that Corel doesn't constantly change for the sake of change.  I'm a lawyer and I find the ability to do things with hot-keys rather than clicking through a bunch of menus or guessing which hieroglyph on a \\""ribbon\\"" performs a rarely-used function is a huge time-saver.  I simply COULD NOT write efficiently without Reveal Codes -- if I either need to see why something isn't right or I need to do some odd stuff, just press F11 and there is all the \\""behind the scenes\\"" stuff.<br /><br />I also like the fact that when I add things like Widows and Orphans control, Keep Text Together, etc., it ACTUALLY DOES. I hate when in Word I click on something like Keep Text With Next -- and nothing happens.<br /><br />I was using X4 and the version I had didn't come with a \\""migrate setting\\"" option. X6 gave me that option and it migrated virtually everything. I noticed it didn't use my highly customized template (completely different menus, custom toolbar, custom keyboard). I was slightly annoyed and went to copy my \\""X4 custom\\"" to \\""X6 custom\\"". The install had already done that. The only thing it didn't do was set my Default Template to the new copy. I pointed Default Template to the new copy, changed Default Document Folder, set the Theme I like, and it's good to go.<br /><br />A few problems I'm sure haven't been fixed, so I might as well mention them.  (I reported them to Corel years ago on numerous occasions but they never fixed them.) When certain formatting is to be applied to selected text that crosses a page boundary, the formatting is only applied up to the page boundary.  For instance, I sometimes have to block-indent several paragraphs that cross a page boundary. I hilite the text and press F4 (left indent) or Shift-F4 (left-right indent). All the paragraphs up to the page boundary will indent, but subsequent ones won't.  Annoying that they've never fixed it, but certainly not a major problem."
1,Avast Free Antivirus has always been up to date with the latest threats. It doesn't seem to miss anything and very much takes care of itself. It makes a non intrusive announcement every time it has been updated and every time it detects a threat. This is definitely the best Free Anti virus program I have discovered so far.
0,"&#34;NOTHING IN THIS LIFE IS FREE&#34; with that being said, u gotta be one DUMB, BROKE, BUM, to download this BOGUS as anti virus....for the record my girlfriend downloaded it on my brand new computer and it made it perform worse than my old 2007 windows vista 256mb ram computer...I never had any problems w that computer and it never had an anti- virus...I came to believe my own GIRLFRIEND hacked my COMPUTER w this BS software!! It locks out your web browser!!! U might as well surf the INTERNET RAW than to protect yourself with this VIRUS ridden trash!!! Pay $30 and get a real ANTI-virus!!!!"
1,Easy to use. Very efficient. Gives results very quickly. Takes care of problems on a timely basis. would certainly recommend
1,I like it because it does block a lot of virus and it let me know when there is a threat. i wish there was a way to block pop up ads.
1,This product is recommended by our computer professional (built my laptop) who is not affiliated with avast or any chain store.
1,"I downloaded this software from Amazon, it took no time at all. It was very affordable, I was not going to pay roughly 70 dollars to protect my computer. The reviews were great, and all though I have only had it a few weeks it has worked great. I had McAfee before and when I installed Norton it removed 80 threats that McAfee didn't get. I am very pleased,gotta love Amazon!"
0,"Like many other reviewers, I have been a Quicken user since the mid-1990s. Due to the usual problems Intuit allows with new releases, I usually don't upgrade until a release has been in use for at least a year. This time, I found a substantially better price on Quicken 2014 Deluxe than I could find for Quicken 2013 Deluxe, so I broke my long-standing rule and have been &#34;rewarded&#34; accordingly. Having been on 2011 right up to the moment it would no longer converse with my banks, I don't have a useful way back to software that functioned reliably so I will have to keep fighting with Intuit's awful customer service system until something works. However, it is too bad MS failed so badly with Money because at this point I'd be willing to try pretty much any competitive money management software.<br /><br />Some of the bugs I've found are: 1) an inability to accurately &#34;match&#34; transactions. You'd think this would be fairly simple, since a &#34;match&#34; should include the amount of the purchase/deposit and the transaction payee. Quicken 2014 randomly selects matches based on no reasonable criteria and you may spend as much time &#34;unmatching&#34; downloaded transactions as you would have spent manually entering transactions. 2) an inability to properly remember login information for several accounts, which requires re-id'ing those accounts each time you download information, 3) random account change flagging, which could be catastrophic if the program decides not to flag a substantial account balance change when something unwanted causes that change (like, in my case, a $10,000 incorrect balance report fro a bank), 4) core programming problems that cause the program to suddenly develop &#34;internal errors&#34; requiring complete removal and reinstallation of the program to resolve.<br /><br />So far, the many Intuit updates have done nothing to fix any of the many program problems. If the past is an indicator of the future, 2014 won't be fully functional until the 2015 release is due. At least I won't have to think about my next update experience until 2017. As for the phone/tablet apps available, there is no chance I'd trust Intuit with something as complicated and unsecured as an iPhone or Android app and my personal finance information. I wouldn't put my personal records on Intuit's cloud, either.l until the 2015 release is due. At least I won't have to think about my next update experience until 2017.

Lots of false &#34;errors&#34; to correct in the forms.  But then... I pay extra so I can eFile and the program says, &#34;You must update to eFile&#34; and the update program is broken.  It is stuck.  It doesn't work.  The forums are full of complaints about this.  We are just 2 days away from the deadline and they don't have this fixed.<br /><br />Next year, I'm paying someone to do my taxes.  It is not worth the headache and hassle to spend an hour or more on the phone with technical support to fix this.  I'll paper file this year, and then say goodbye to H&R Block."
0,"2012 and all prior versions allowed you a display edit choice to gray out an account on the account bar so that it shows, with the total, but the total is not included in the net worth calculation.  For no imaginable reason, they dropped that option in 2013.  I found 2013 to be unusable, and I am worried that eventually I will be forced to upgrade my version.  There is never a reason to decrease options - it wasn't being forced on anyone who didn't use it. To me, this is just inexcusable."
1,It does everything you could want but I did need to get a customer service rep involved because of issues trying to install it.  The rep was excellent and did an amazing job as I am no computer expert.
1,Microsoft Office works well! It just took me a little while to figure out where the file opened after being downloaded to my pc.
1,After reading the reviews I was a little nervous with having problems downloading.  Easy and fast download with no issues. Thankful for excel and outlook again.
0,"I have been a costumer using Deluxe for better than 15 years. This year I will be looking for other software, rather than be forced into buying the Premier version."
1,"Since it's required every 3 years, it was time to upgrade from our 2011 version.  I've been a Quicken user for a long time, starting around 1994, so I know the drill. I like to wait as long as possible before upgrading, just to make sure they had time to remove any bugs.  The installation was smooth - I backed up my files before starting, and walked through the install without issue.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that 2014 looks almost exactly like 2011, except for a new &#34;One Step Update&#34; dialog.  Other than that, I haven't found a difference. I could see why someone could be disappointed since it appears that Intuit just dialed it in.<br /><br />I haven't used the mobile app, and I doubt I will bother.  I would love a full online version of Quicken, but I refuse to use a sub-featured app that syncs data with my desktop.  In my opinion it's a joke: I suspect it's their way of satisfying those users thinking of using Mint, but not giving so much that they lose users from QuickBooks.  I just want Quicken on the web: reports, custom categories (add/remove), manual entry, etc, and I'm willing to pay for it."
1,"I like Turbo Tax. Have used it several times and each time, I find it is very user friendly. It works!"
0,"I have been using Bitdefender since 2011. This year after already getting 2015, I switched back to Kaspersky who I used to be very satisfied with. Why did I switch to Bitdefender at all if I was satisfied with Kaspersky. I got it free to sample. Contrary to popular opinion, getting something free doesn’t automatically mean a 5-star review, in fact I was never able to give Bitdefender a positive review the entire time I used them.<br /><br />Did Bitdefender protect my computer? Well, I never got invaded with a virus if that is one measure. But frankly I have used virtually every brand of anti-virus program and I’ve never been invaded with a virus so I’m not sure that’s a ringing endorsement for Bitdefender. Each time, however, I ran a scan with another application to see if Bitdefender the other app was able to find things that Bitdefender missed. Granted none of those would have disabled my computer but nevertheless, it wasn’t perfect.<br /><br />What I hated about Bitdefender (and judging by so many comments from other reviewers over the past few years, is the following:<br /><br />1. They are resource hogs. They try to pack so many unnecessary “features” into their program that they have a tangible negative impact on computer performance … and I am running it on a VERY powerful computer. Kaspersky, by contrast, is probably the least heavy-handed AVG program I have used.<br /><br />2. INVASIVE!! That seems to be the #1 complaint over the years, they are like leeches. Once they get your email address you are subject to a non-stop barrage of ads from them. I’ve “unsubscribed”, I’ve written emails and letters to them. They’ve promised to stop but no, they never do. They are one of the most annoying software companies on the planet.<br /><br />3. It doesn’t stop with emails. You can be on a conference call doing a presentation with the president of your company and your biggest client and all of a sudden a huge box will expand from the lower right of your screen and cover the critical spreadsheet you are reading. And it stays there until Bitdefender decides it’s been there long enough. You can’t “x” it out. You can’t set a “do not disturb” protocol. Per Bitdefender they are doing it as a SERVICE to me and I don’t have a choice about it.<br /><br />4. They start pestering you 6 months before your product is set to renew. One day it’s a “last and final special offer for $39.94” that you get maybe 50 times over the course of several months. Then it’s “your absolute last chance” except this time the SPECIAL price is $69.95. Are these good deals? No, when I dropped in to my local computer store their everyday price for the full retail version was $29.95.<br /><br />5. When your subscription ends they ask you why you left them. They have an option that asks if it was because you were pestered with too many ads. Do you think a company who knows they are losing customers because of too many ads would do something about it? Um, no. Once again I clicked “never bother me again” and once again they still pester me with that “special come back for only $69.95 for an UPGRADE” deal.<br /><br />And THAT is why I can’t recommend Bitdefender.

0,"Compare with LibreOffice and save yourself some money.    Corel WordPerfect Office is horrendously and hopelessly outdated. If you want to see for yourself, then find some complex Microsoft Office documents and open them up in WordPerfect X7 and LibreOffice 4.3 side-by-side and see for yourself.    LibreOffice is open source software, always free of charge, and has components comparable to the full edition of Microsoft Office.    Corel WordPerfect Office looks and feels like a program from the 1990s. It won't outright mutilate Microsoft formats, but it does not display them as the author intended them to look. LibreOffice does a much better job.    You don't have to spend any money to see the difference. Just install the free trial of Corel WordPerfect Office X7 from their site and observe the difference. The free trial is good for 30 days, but after you compare it to LibreOffice, that's 29.99 days more than you'll need.    There was a time when WordPerfect was about the best you were going to do outside of Microsoft's office suite, but those days ended, probably 10 years ago. Corel was having all kinds of financial problems in the early 00s, so they took a bunch of Microsoft money in exchange for dropping Corel Linux and their WordPerfect Office port to Linux, and ending their work on Wine. Fortunately, in the long run, it didn't matter. Linux is alive and well and I can't see anything that Linux users are missing from Corel's current line up of software.    All that's really left of the WordPerfect Office suite is a clunky eyesore that someone has patched up well enough to kind of/sort of keep working."
1,Turbo Tax helped me get nearly 1500 to my state and federal government.
1,This works great on my mac mini. my external speakers aren't quite loud enough during certain movies or on websites so this program definitely comes in handy to have.
1,"I was able to file my Federal and State taxes with confidence, knowing my taxes were figured accurately.  I recommend it to everyone.  Much better and cheaper than H & R Block."
0,you put my income on the wrong line now I have to submit an amended form walter mcgarry
0,"When downloading and installing this on my Acer laptop it crashed my computer.  I've spent hours trying to get my computer up and running and nothing has worked.  I'm continuing to work with Norton customer service and will update this review if the problem is resolved.  At this point, I've lost invaluable data and may need to purchase a new laptop.  Believe me, this product is not worth the risk it presents.  Do not purchase this software!!"
0,"took forever to download, save yourself time and aggravation and just go tot the store and buy it."
1,Works great!
1,Ease of usasge really helped me get set-up and running quickly
1,Easy to use with step by step guidance.  Download was straightforward.  Feel confident that my return is complete and accurate.
1,The features are easy to understand and use.
1,Less buggy than 2014.
0,Last year that I will use Turbotax. I've been using Turbotax as long as it's been on the market but the version inflation this year has turned me off permanently. I have a simple schd E and C to do and get a message that I have to upgrade where last year it handled my simple four line schedules easily. When I called in I got this explanation about how they wanted the questions asked by the software to be appropriate for my situation. BUT they already were all these past years. Clearly just a way to increase their revenue by version inflation. They did end up providing me the upgrade for free but I never would have known that if I hadn't called. Competitive products will still handle my situation without the up charges.
1,"I mostly bought this program for its OCR ability but it is also great for combining and editing pdf files. For what I bought it for, it is 5 stars. Now about the validation and installation. Once you download the software, the downloader will give you the option to install or view key. Click view key. This gives you your product number, not your serial key. Amazon does not make that clear enough with the page that has your product number. Use this number with the link on the page or the link in the .pdf amazon sends you in the folder you downloaded that also contains the software. This pdf also contains all the instructions you need. I filled out the personal info, school info and gave my school email. I was instantly sent the serial key. I did this all at around 1pm during business hours but I believe it is an automated system if you use your school email.<br /><br />The install failed the first time but worked the second. I think the first fail was due to the fact windows had just installed updates and had not rebooted yet."
1,Norton Internet Security 2011 is the best. I had Norton many years ago and it went downhill very badly. I tried it again and love it. It does the job it is suppose to do and you don't even know it is running. It gives you much info if you even care to look at it. I love it and so glad I am back with Norton. Norton found 6 trojans which AVG did not find. Get it and you will like it and be secure both with firewall and anti-virus. It is the best. It does not slow down my system in any way. Norton did there homework and have an excellent program.
0,"It's been 10 years since I used Quicken, and it hasn't changed significantly at all! Very antiquated, and has bugs with connecting to Regions bank accounts that several different customer support  agents have not been able to resolve. A total waste of money! I recommend WAVEAPPS here:► https://www.waveapps.com/"
1,"I have been a quicken user since the late 1970's .  Don't upgrade every time.  Had some trouble getting used to some of the upgrades-not 2015.  Transition was effortless.  I am amazed at the people who have no idea of their finances.  I just run the year end report and give it to my CPA.  Every thing is already compiled.  Income, Tax refunds from last year, medical, travel expenses, home repairs,  etc.  Able to split credit cards into different categories if necessary.  reconcile three bank statements in less than ten minutes.  Don't know how if could live without Quicken!!!"
1,"Has incredible protection even when surfing the web. Has blocked many redirects to suspicious pages. Has the ability to turn off shields on pages you know are safe like YouTube, Facebook, etc."
1,I've used TurboTax for several years.  It's always so easy to follow the directions and steps to do my taxes.  Keep up the good work.
0,"I purchased the product today.  When installing, a window came up explaining that I was recently billed for the payroll service.  It said to call them at an 866 number to be credited back.  I called the number which has a message that gives a website and promptly hangs up.  I try the website and find no obvious help.  A help box comes up and gives me an 800 number that has the same message and hangs up."
0,"A few issues, but for the money it's nothing I can't work around."
1,This is the way I get all my programs and Amazon offers the best of downloads. Will use in the future.
0,I've used Quicken for years so was excited to see 2013 version actually had something new to offer.  The cloud and mobile feature seemed worth the expense.  They don't really have this working so well though.  Updating to the cloud duplicates transactions and corrupts not only the cloud file but also the PC file.  Better have a current backup file or your file will be junk which is the rating I would give to quicken 2013.  They did give me my money back and I just bought Turbotax - although I seriously considered buying another tax program.
0,"It's shameful Intuit would release a product that should be a beta than a production release. I am a long term Quicken user from back in the DOS days and a former beta tester! Upgrading from Home and Business 2010 was a nightmare! After purchasing the download I installed it, and the program returned an error it couldn't apply updates it had downloaded. Next up was to acquire the patch and manually install. Needless to say it broke the windows installer and and completely destroyed the Norton Ghost installation. This issue couldn't be resolved so I have requested a refund.<br /><br />The program is buggy, the budgeting interface is aweful, no customization of a color interface, and very busy and confusing. Quicken never was strong on the budgeting component, but this is the WORST I have ever seen.<br /><br />The add reports to the toolbar customization, doesn't work! Saved programs from previous versions do not work. The savings Goals graphs are not formated correctly and the dollar amount is cut off on the right of the screen. Additionaly, unless you specify a target goal amount, the current amount residing in savings goals won't even display. The budget reports are inaccurate and more time than there worth. The default Personal Income and Personal Expense groups cannot be removed which is the source of the inaccuracy. Geesh, did anyone at Intuit have an accounting primer or have a clue how this is to work. Many of the same errors have been present in the last 3 Windows releases.<br /><br />Enter the Ipad, Android mobile app. All fine and dandy but I for one could care less about putting my financial data in the cloud, on someone elses server. A mobile app is fine, if it could sync directly to the desktop. Call me old fashioned. In testing the Cloud I have found it is a hybrid version of mint and desktop quicken and quite frankly doesn't work. The mobile version will aggregate real time account data which tells me you have surrended your passwords and given accessto your accounts. It also produces and alters the register balance, deletes your historical transactions on sync which is the source of the error, making it incorrect and not accurate at all! Basically they have tried to merge Mint and Desktop together  and its failed. For those that value your finances and keep accurate records, this is not the product!<br /><br />I could rant on, but I wont. The bozos who are part of the product development team need to get their act together. What I am intersted in is a solid desktop financial product based on trusted accounting principles. What I am not interested in is a product geared for the GenX GenY generation. I have a feeling the end of comprehensive desktop software is near it's end.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not recommend purchasing this product at this time. Its nothing more than a public beta release. The cloud sync is a security disaster waiting to happen. Buyer Beware! INTUIT NEEDS TO RELEASE A PRODUCT PATCH WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK!<br /><br />UPDATE: R3 RELEASE<br /><br />Little has changed in this release. Mobile Sync is still non usable.<br />Saved Reports shortcuts have not been fixed.<br />Verify file in File Operations hangs and does not complete.<br />Whole interface is more clunky and unstable, crashes routinely on Windows Pro 64bit. R2 did not have this problem.<br />Custom Expense Graph is not accurate. The sumary box displays an inaccurate total, until the view whole graph is clicked, which produces the correct result.<br /><br />OVERHAUL ANNOYANCE is the inability to customize the categories used in the stock views. EG. My Money View, is of little value as a complete summation of useless data that one may or may not want to track. The lack of the ability to customize these views is an otherwise waste of screen space. I think most will agree, Personal accounting is just that, and what the developers feel what should be reported and viewed isn't necessarily the right one.<br /><br />The strong points of the program are the powerful historical data collection and reporting capabilities, the direct downloads from hundreds of financial institutions, and free flowing data entry interface. If you can live without investment data and require to the penny accuracy you should consider Quick Books. Honestly Quicken is Intuits CASH COW, but I think this cow is out of milk. Unfortunately  I am actively searching and trialing several competing products as an alternate replacment, and yes I have used it for more than 20 years. This product by all practical purposes is at the end of its life in its current state couopled with a mandatory update every three years with Intuits sunset policy, and a recurrent history of NEVER fixing whats broken and releasing the same junk year after year. It's not a matter of \\""if\\"" but \\""when\\"" will Intuit drive that final nail!<br /><br />UPDATE RELEASE 4<br /><br />Released solved nothing. Product is mess, junk, broke. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE R6<br /><br />Release resolved nothing. Core bugs remain, R6 completely screwed up the data file. THIS IS THE WORST RELEASE OF QUICKEN SOFTWARE SINCE ITS INCEPTION!!!!! I HAVE DOWNGRADED MY RATING TO 1, AND I MAINTAIN A DO NOT BUY FOR THIS JUNK! IT IS UNRELIABLE, YOU CAN NOT TRUST THE DATA, AND SO MUCH OF THE REPORTING IS BROKE AND INACURATE, I AM SORRY I EVER USED IT. This product is simply unacceptable so to the customer service reps that keep responding, STOP THE BULLSHIT. The product is broke!"
0,"So if my reading of this debacle is correct then Intuit is telling everyone they are &#34;bringing consistency to the various platforms TurboTax is offered on to avoid customer confusion&#34;. Timeline: Intuit takes a product that originally came on a single platform  (disks you stuck in your computer) and eventually added other platforms (online, mobile, etc.) that are dumbed down from the original. Now, Intuit decides to remove stuff from the original hard media based platform to match the less able newer platforms. And they announce the truncated features in a most confusing fashion while advocating (sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly) the customer buy more expensive versions of TurboTax<br /><br />My first thoughts are not printable so I'll move on to the 4th or 5th. The initial dumbing down of mobile I get since it just ain't got the screen space for more complex spreadsheety type applications. But Intuit wants us to think they were somehow surprised how that turned out? Online versions should have not been launched with truncated features, UNLESS, this was the business plan from the start. A client/server computing relationship was the only way it worked until the personal computer was invented. Google seems to run some pretty heavy apps using that model with Chromebooks, etc.<br />Get real Intuit. You Are Busted. This was a profit grab pure and simple that exactly mirrors the 1 pound can of coffee now weighing 11 oz. for the same price. Sure there's a labeling saying it weighs 11 oz. but there are no big signs pointing to it saying PAY THE SAME BUT GET LESS."
0,"I have been using TurboTax for well over ten years. This year, I purchased the Basic+e-file download from Amazon, and downloaded it , using it several days later. It loaded the previous years information and I typed in my income and federal taxes, saved it and got off. When I resumed a few days later, it couldn't find my tax files, which had been on my computer earlier, and had now disappeared from my computer!<br /><br />I did find my way back somehow- it was a bit of a mystery chase, but I was able to download the pdf of my 2011 taxes from their site(whew!). then I went ahead and finished my very simple tax deductions, and came to the end. Turns out they wanted me to pay another 39.95!  I looked for an answer, but finally found the chat box area, which is not as much of a wait- maybe 7 minutes. When the chat person came on, she asked my situation and I related the above. Then she asked if I would like a refund of the difference. I told her,no, that's called bait and switch and is illegal. She never answered, and the &#34;all our agents are busy. wait time is approximately 41 minutes! Isn't THAT a bag of stuff! I had a situation that was very similar last year as well. I think I'll be ending my business with Intuit!"
1,"Great antivirus, no issues with my computer."
1,If you are looking for a program to migrate and copy your entire os from your main drive on your pc to and external drive through the USB then this is perfect for you.  AND FREE ON AMAZON! I wanted to replace my hard drive with a solid state drive on my new Windows 8.1 laptop and mini tool does exactly that and right though the USB port fast and easy. Excellent!
1,"QB is extremely helpful in keeping everything straight! I am happy to play with the latest version. So far, so good."
1,"Adobe has always been the best of the best, until their Creative Cloud service kicked in.  This legacy edition of the Adobe Master Suite is the perfect tool for anyone who doesn't want to simply rent this great software.  It is especially good for students who don't have Internet access 24/7."
0,"Does it's job, but bloated and ties up memory. There are less expensive options that are just as effective. I've used Norton for 15 years, but won't anymore."
0,I was hoping for some good templates to use when starting my buisness.  I wound up using The free templates from Microsoft Word.
0,"after entering my info it told me I owed over $12,000 to IRS.  I then went to my CPA with the same exact information and I owed and paid about $700.  Big difference."
1,When I can relax I enjoy Carmen Sandiego
1,I love this program. I'm a new business owner and not the best in the accounting and bookkeeping department. QuickBooks makes it easy!
0,"PrintMaster2012 is better than the new PrintMaster6.  There is no longer a high definition view of the whole page of photos you are working on, as in PM2012.  With PM6 you only get a hi-def view of just one photo - the one you are working on, and the rest are blurred.  Big problem when trying to layout a page of photos with text.  I experienced other problems importing files from PM2012 too.  PM6 is a downgrade from PM2012, not an upgrade. A big waste of money."
0,"I can't give this zero stars, huh?  I guess I was thinking that the other reviewers were just too critical.  Yes, it is stupid to charge $441.95 to renew your subscription to Intuit P/R especially when you can buy the latest version of QBPro AND Enhanced P/R for $299.95, but hey, at least you can.  QBPro installed fine and the data conversion went well.  It still does what I want it to.  Then I called to activate P/R.  A very pleasant young lady (OK, her English was maybe a little rough) helped me through the activation (because the read.me file instructions were just wrong), and off we went.  I made sure to confirm with her that I would not be charged for the P/R renewal.  She assured me I wouldn't. . .<br /><br />Then . . . two days later . . . I get the paid receipt (charged to my credit card after my specific instructions not to) for $441.95.  Aaarrrrgggggghhhhh!  Luckily it only took 45 minutes to get that double charge straightened out.<br /><br />Where do I send the bill for my time?"
1,"It is swift, fast and quite easy to install. I had my old Norton replaced and I love this new version!"
1,"I had some virus problems, and had another FREE program, and it didn't get it, I got Avast and found it, now, it is keep me virus free, and blocked bad sights, so I&#34;m so happy."
1,Good stuff.
1,"This proces is pretty good, really, it has powerful playing function to play any Blu-ray disc without any limitation. It also works well in playing the media file and even 1080p high-definition video.<br /><br />This purchase is pretty goood."
1,I use this program all the time to protect my PC and I paid double price what I paid for Amazon
0,The HELP function never worked.  H&R Block support helped me uninstall and reinstall but it didn't help.  Will consider another option in the future.
1,"As I recall, Quicken had its beginnings in a product called &#34;Electric Checkbook&#34; in the early 80's. Since then it has continued to develop into a full-fledged financial manager which is indispensable for wealth management, monitoring, control, and taxes. We use it every morning to download the latest financial transactions making financial tasks much less time consuming and tedious. Great software and easy to use."
0,"The format is basically the same as last year but the State part has some problems, Make sure you print out the filed out form and check. It has a tendency to auto fill items that may surprise you on filing."
0,I've used Turbo tax several years in a row now--it does what I want it to but I'm downgrading it because of what I consider to be a fundamental dishonesty in how it is advertised. This has been mentioned but many others in on-line reviews: You buy it and it purports to give you an included state e-file in the purchase price. This isn't true and you find out about it at the end.
1,another photographer turned me on to this program... so far I am loving what it can do.... I just need to take better pics.. I am getting a green glow thats hard to remove.
0,"I've used TurboTax since my first copy on my 486DX2-66 PC..<br />I've never even considered anything else.. However with the price I've decided it's time to see what my options are.<br />Folks, you can use TaxACT online and e-file state and federal for $20 TOTAL!!!<br />AND AND AND - you don't pay until you file!!<br />And from what I see you can do a lot for free..."
1,is a good software for my laptopt and my cellphone... is very easy for instalation and very easy for use
1,Worked as advertised . Feel like it was a good purchase.
1,"Great product even though it's a little pricey.  It downloaded quickly, installed easily and was simple to use.  As long as the government continues to collect taxes, I guess I'll be stuck buying this again.  Wish they'd give a discount to repeat customers."
0,"I decided to take a chance on this, but I won't do it twice. I wound up going back to TaxCut. TaxAct gave me pretty much the same results as TaxCut (I did my 2011 returns with both), but generating my return was more logical and intuitive with TaxCut than TaxAct. If you're heavily into taxes and familiar with the arcane tax lingo then TaxAct would probably be as good as the competition, but otherwise, I'd avoid it."
1,"I've been a Tax Cut person for about 10 years. No surprises, the software worked well as it always has done. I like to get the frequent update that Taxcut/ HRB@Home provides once my Return is submitted.<br /><br />Have never tried other Tax software since TC has always met my needs. It works well, why change?"
0,The download didn't work for me.
0,"I was unable to active this product online, and manual activation requires that you contact the Paragon 'support team.'  When I called the number for Paragon support provided by amazon.com, their canned phone menu indicates that to speak to anyone you must pay for support.  I'm grateful that amazon.com has made an exception in this case to their &#34;no refunds&#34; policy for software downloads (although that took two calls).  Paragon certainly made a bad first impression, and I'll be avoiding their products in the future."
1,download was flawless quick took 2 hours because of microsofts 87 updates  rebooted  had pro 7 would recomend this to anyone looking to update  after upgrading memory in my wifes laptop i will order again  thank you amazon  albin hook
0,"Microsoft has discontinued this product and suggests using Bing Maps. Don't buy this product. Bing Maps is OK but I recommend you find something else. What's most annoying is Amazon didn't bother to mention this application is end of lifed. I found out during the setup, on the Microsoft web site. The app does not use the GPS on Microsoft's own Surface Pro 3. Making it useless to me. Waste of money."
0,This software is for gaming only. It doesn't specify that anywhere in the product description therefore I purchased a product that I cannot use.
1,"As always, Turbo Tax walks you right through it. Very easy to use and follow. Great product."
1,"Well written, easy to follow - Amazon price was less than on the Adobe site - download was not complicated - I'm satisfied with the purchase"
1,Norton makes a good product the price was right I needed a 5 pack for the computers we have so this fit the bill Thank You
0,"I LOVED my Office 2010 on my PC, but then ended up gving my PC (and office) to my daughter in college whose computer &#34;broke&#34; and so got this mac version for my macbook air.  While it exceeds the Apple pages and numbers, it is far from the pc version, and I find it frustrating that it is so lacking in comparison.  As soon as my mac &#34;dies&#34; I'm going back to my PC if only for the PC version of Office."
0,"I have been a Norton user for a number of years, and think this will be my last. The renewal cost is at least twice as much as buying a new product. Installation took 3-4 attempts. Didn't automatically add remaining time to new program, had to call the service center. The mobile app is not one of the 3 licenses available. On the plus side, I do believe it is good at stopping attacks and keeping the computer virus free."
1,Good program. Prompt alert. Informative on updating and suggestion. I did recommend to my family and friends to subscribe to avast.
1,"I have been using this software for years and recently made a major purchasing error. I called Amazon and the Rep (sorry, I forgot his name) was so helpful.  He changed my order;  gave me a credit for the incorrect order; and I downloaded and was on my way to preparing my tax return.  Thank you Amazon for such exceptional service.  Keep it up!"
1,"Very easy to use, plus got nice refund! Two years in a row I have used it. Saves all for easy next year too."
1,On second computer
1,No problems with the latest version. It's as easy as you  can expect with our difficult and confusion tax laws.
1,A solid part of an efficient business.
0,I really hoped this would work. Using the conversion tool coming from Quicken 2012 only about 20% of my entries came over.  The amounts are of course off and I found very little functionality when compared to the 3 yo windows product.  As others have posted you will be unable to do basic banking functions with this program. Quicken support is the worst.<br />Read the reviews.  This is a total waste of money.
1,Great product for any pc or windows tablet
1,Avast! is the best antivirus I have ever used. I recommend it to all my friends and relatives. Its free and easy to use. It is not a resource hog like the others antivirus programs I have tried.
1,Great product! Works wonderfully.
1,I buy it every year.
0,"Prior to yesterday I would have said that the subscription service was a problem but the programs are not.  However, after all my purchased software reverted to trial software that I cannot use, now I know that the software is subpar.   I am really regretting that I purchased Creative Cloud.  The first mistake was day one, I somehow ended up with a prepaid one year membership.  The last I ever want to do is prepay a corporation for a subscription service.  Because, when they don't provide the service as advertised, guess what, they don't offer any refunds for the lack of service.   The larger cultural issue is how corporations in general give such lousy customer service.  Once they have your money they really will do everything possible to hold onto it regardless of whether they are right or wrong.  (One exception is Amazon, kudos for their convenient return policy.)   So right now I have an unusable subscription that I have to put my time and effort into fixing myself."
0,"Quickbooks is good, but the payroll isn't that great.  It is far more complex than necessary for simple payroll tasks and other services have automated tax filings that QuickBooks makes you do yourself.  I'd say it isn't very streamlined.  I have also not been able to figure out why it excluded one of my W-2 employees when creating the W-3.  Everyone was paid through QuickBooks Payroll."
0,"I liked my Quicken 2009 quite well and was distraught when I found they put coding into it that prevented it from getting information from my bank after a particular date. I tried going without Quicken for the past year and ended up with two overdrafts due to scheduled automatic payments from my checking account that I forgot about. I broke down and purchased Quicken Starter Edition 2014, figuring that it would pay for itself in helping me avoid overdraft fees.<br /><br />It does everything I expect it to do, but the layout and entry method is significantly different than my old Quicken. I can't just press \\""enter\\"" and \\""tab\\"" or use arrow keys to move among fields and entries. After a month of use I'm still trying to acclimate myself to how it operates. It's functionality is restricted to checking and savings accounts, so when I tried to set up a loan-type account (tracking payments to my roofer for work done), it only offered options for checking/savings. Even with Mint.com it tracks my credit card account with my credit union for free; Quicken Starter Edition won't do that.<br /><br />On the upside, it does let me know when a bill is coming due, and for me that feature is more useful in this version than in the 2009 edition; its default settings enter the upcoming bill into your register in red print to let you know to budget that much, rather than just a popup reminder asking if you want to enter the amount into the register."
0,"Great application but the mobile version does not support multi currencies and I cannot add expenses directly to it, it must done through the main software on the computer."
1,Saves me money every year.  My taxes would be otherwise too complex to do on my own.  I tried it once then bought TurboTax.  It saved me $800 and took 1/10th the time.
1,"Easy download, like the new features (added since 2004 - the last MS Office for Mac that I purchased), and reasonably priced. No problems so far."
0,wouldn't work with my laptop - unable to set and kept popping up unexpectedly.
1,"This is a great product with major new improvements. With Quicken 2015 for Mac, I can control all my finances in one convenient place. It’s an easy way to track my spending and bills. This product is better (less bugs) and more stable than competing products.  Very easy to use"
1,"GREAT, USE IT EVERY YEAR"
0,"I would have given it four stars except for the constant daily advertising to &#34;upgrade&#34; our buy other services to speed up your computer, etc."
0,"Sorry, but this is pretty misleading.  Can not understand what this really is."
0,"I have been using Quicken for as long as it's been around.  It's a great product but the last two versions I have had, 2012 and 2014, have some glitches that they cannot seem to solve.  They bomb the program.  Fortunately the database doesn't seem to be harmed.  The latest problem with the 2014 version is with Investing accounts.  Quicken will throw me out after an automatic download from my brokerage firm when I just try to go to one of those accounts.<br />  Another thing that's always been a problem is \\""undoing\\"" anything.  Most of the time you can't.<br />  The reports and graphs also give me pain at times.  It's very difficult to format them to give the data you want.<br />  Otherwise I couldn't live without it."
1,Avast was recommended by the people who built my computer.  It is easy to work with and seems to do a very good job
0,"Unstable, Unuseable. I rolled back to 2013 and demanded a refund. Intuit uses their customers to beta new releases.In one word: Sucks."
1,OpenOffice 4.0.1 is an excellent program.  Where do I obtain a license to offer it for sale?
0,"I discovered after having to uninstall and reinstall Quicken 2014 several times that the software is not ready for Windows 8.1. A major problem with the Quicken 2014 is the latency within the register. After entering a transaction, the application takes fifteen seconds or more to enter the transaction. There are many suggestions from users pertaining how to correct the problem but it seems that customers still have the issues and Intuit technical support is not helping resolve the problems. I finally uninstalled Windows 8.1 and Quicken 2014 works as it should."
1,Installed at Lawyers office and still no problems
0,doesn't seem to work with windows live mail so sending estimates are somewhat of a pain.<br />otherwise good product so fare
0,"I had to delete it from my computer because it ran so slow.  I have a 1.5GHZ Centrino with 2gigs of RAM.  I did get a refund even though it is a download.  Also, you can't scan and attatch receipts to this program.  I need something to help me keep track of my expenses and would like it to have the ability to upload receipts.  I don't know what I'm going to use, but it won't be Quickbooks!  This is useless junk!"
1,Norton has been good for me. It's a large program but makes me feel safe as you can online. You can set the program to monitor less in you need to for memory issues. I don't use any other form but Nortons for years.
1,Avast is awesome! It catches the viruses before they can attack your computer! It's superfast! It's alot better than MacAfee.
0,"I did not feel that there was any \\""upgrade\\"" to this product from the old version.  My needs are very basic, the only reason I bought it was the threat that I could no longer download transactions in the near future.  Think I got scr#wed on this deal."
0,"I have been a Mac person for decades, and have been waiting for my accountant to give me the go ahead to FINALLY purchase the Mac version of Quickbooks for, what seems, nearly as long. Prior to Apple going over to the Intel architecture I always had to maintain a PC in the house just to do my bookkeeping. Once solutions like Parallels and VMWare became available, I was at least able to run Windows on my Mac so I could at least do my bookkeeping on the same machine I do everything else.<br /><br />The feature I've been waiting for all these years is the ability to make an accountants copy. According to my accountant, until that particular feature is incorporated into Quickbooks for Mac, no accountant will EVER recommend this product to their clients. It puzzles him why Intuit would continue to produce a product that, as another reviewer put it, \\""is DOA\\"" for any customers who use the services of an accountant. My accountant often \\""half jokes\\"" that Intuit doesn't appear to know much about accounting.<br /><br />I've sent Intuit feedback over the years, explaining the importance of this feature, and strongly recommending they incorporate it into a future version. So far, my suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. If you use an accountant in conjunction with Quickbooks to do your bookkeeping and taxes, don't waste your money on this product. Stick with the Windows version. This product is another example of a third party vendor giving Mac owners the short end of the stick once again ..."
0,"I used this at my workplace. It is an &#34;OK&#34; product. but i wanted to chip into the 1 star reviews, because if u look carefully at the 5 star reviews, a large portion of them are disingenuous. the kind of internet credibility that you gain by paying &#34;like farms&#34; -shady companies that make loads of accounts to rate ur product. some of these are brand new accounts with only 1 review, unverified. others are have literally hundreds of non-verified purchases reviews of the most random things.<br /><br />I'm not outraged at this, but just be warned. there is something wrong with the distribution of ratings and types of raters.<br />THIS PRODUCT IS &#34;OK&#34; at best...my big gripe is that QB is more dishonest than most. if u used quickbooks before, and u don't want to learn something new. its ultimately going to cost a similar price to the other subscription payroll/accounting/inventory tracking softwares. I will continue to use it... but It feels dirty."
1,This had to have been the easiest Windows upgrade I have ever accomplished.  I upgraded my computer from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate.  The whole operation from start to finish took less than 30 minutes.  I have not run into any problems since the install.
1,"My wife and I bought our first house recently and instead of jumping into renovations or trying to visualize a room based off pintrest designs or samples from Home Depot, I decided to purchase this program. And thank God I did!<br /><br />We had renovation ideas for our kitchen that we thought would look good, but after we plugged in our floor plan and did our renovation, we decided that it just wouldnt look right. After weeks of fun for myself and my wife, we finally came up with the design we really liked.<br /><br />If it werent for this program, we may have wasted a ton of money and time doing renovations that we may have regretted later on.  I also love the fact that you can take snapshots and print them out for reference. I made an entire binder full of before and after layouts that are fun to show family and friends.<br /><br />Although this program is VERY thorough and the resources seem limitless, it is a very easy program to use. My wife got on and seemed to master the program within minutes.  Coming from someone who works with AutoCAD everyday, I do wish however that you could simply type in the wall dimensions instead of clicking and dragging which can be tedious at times. Overall, this program has completely surpassed my expectations and would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to do any kind of renovation."
0,it does not work at all  dont buy this. You cannot print from this useless program
1,"It gave less explanations than the other computer tax program I used,(Turbo Tax), but the price was right, and it successfully filed my State and Federal taxes, and resulted in a prompt refund. For those 2 reasons alone, I gave it 4 stars."
0,"Because of all the bad reviews I purchased and paid more from microsoft.  I think the problems are coming from<br />preloaded software.  Microsoft had me uninstall the copy of Office Suite that had been loaded on the new computer<br />before I could put Microsoft WORD 2013 on the new computer running Win 8.1.<br /><br />Many many problems caused with this OS are created by software with conflicts and multiple installations of<br />the same program creating conflicts.  So if you just want one of the programs, be sure you have uninstalled<br />the versions they have put on the system.  Used to they just put some time of download on there for you to<br />install but evidently they are installing these programs from the factory and thus the problems.  You may not<br />even really know they are running as this one would not even recognize a word file (it did after I took off Suite and<br />put only Word on).  Hope this helps folks. I had virus problems (conflicting software) because I didn't know they<br />had preinstalled a virus program I did not want and there was no warning."
0,Soso
1,Successful tax year
0,"Worst buy of my life. Apparently my device isn't compatible with the code (which you don't find out until after you purchase and enter the code), so now I've lost $100 for nothing."
1,I finally finished my taxes using H&R Block and mailed them and today an update came out when it is too late.  I have been using Turbo Tax for years. Especially since where I lived you were able to get it free from the library but I moved and heard there were problems with Turbo Tax so decided to use something else. I also got the free edition for Tax Act just to see what it was like.<br />I think Turbo Tax is the best product.  I think it is more helpful that H&R with tax advice but I was surprised how much I liked Tax Act.  It did not transfer the information from last year’s Turbo Tax like H&R but it was very easy to use.  Because I moved I needed to have 2 states and H&R wanted $40 for the second state. With Tax Act I could buy a state for $15 so I went back and forth between the 2 programs to make sure my federal matched and it was interesting.  They both came up with the same rate for taxes but it was a great way for me to check for mistakes I made. I think next year I will use Tax Act
0,Will not open on my window 8. boooo
0,Very complicated.  Wasn't as efficient as the previous versions
1,"I have been a Turbo Tax user for years.  I was late getting my taxes done for 2013 because I was taking care of my Mother, but Turbo tax made it so easy, I had them done in no time.  I always feel like they are done correctly and nothing was missed.  Downloading from Amazon was so easy.  You are great."
0,Suddenly &#34;Deluxe&#34; won't do my taxes as it has in the past for a number of years.  So I ordered &#34;Premier&#34; and then discovered my older Mac OS X  Snow Leopard would not support it.  Had to borrow a computer .  I'm through with TurboTax.
1,"Program effectiveness has been reviewed elsewhere by professionals and judged excellent.  My concern was ease of use and the difficulty of switching a license from an old computer to a new computer.  The three license program (This review apples to both Norton 360 and Norton Internet Security) is very easy to install and the license process, both initial installation and switch, is intuitive and easy.  Initial installation on all three computers went smoothly; Norton recognized existing antivirus/firewall programs and offered to uninstall them.  Yes!  After updates and several reboots, Norton was up-to-date and running.  Later I wanted to switch one of the licenses to a new computer.  I downloaded a 60 day trial version to the new computer - same easy installation - and ran all four computers for a few weeks to ensure everything was working properly.  Then I uninstalled Norton from the old computer, which automatically freed up a license copy on my Norton account. I then installed the license on the new computer trial version. All went smoothly again.  Finally, I've found it cheaper to buy the 3-copy version on sale somewhere instead of automatically renewing thru Norton.  Installing the new license is easy, too."
0,"I would like it better if there were more creative options, but this one is a good value for the cost."
1,It is the best antivirus software I have ever used. I have used a tried a few. I consider it the best.
1,"I have a fitness studio so my customers pay a membership on a schedule. I had spent some effort trying to create a custom database of customers that would automatically invoice them on a schedule via emails, but even with that I was looking for a 3rd party auto-payment billing system. Quickbooks Online does everything I was looking for in one package.<br />As with any new software package, I got hung up on several details during my setup of Quickbooks Online. I called the support number they provided and the rep answered my questions and stayed with me until I had worked through my snags, even taking the time to seek higher level answers from her supervisor when there were several options for my tasks.<br />Quickbooks Online has made some of the trickiest parts of starting an independent business much easier, and at a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional bookkeeper."
1,"I converted from another system.  After some time, I was able to do everything I need.  It still is missing a few things (e.g., automatic way to run the same monthly reports) - but otherwise good - and a good value."
1,"Works well at detecting threats, updates quickly, doesn't bog down the system with excessive overhead, fast on-demand scans of individual files, OK speed on system scans. Good interception of potentially harmful webpages. The e-mail scan feature can cause occasional certificate conflicts with Thunderbird, but this is a minor quibble. Occasional popups from Win7 notification area for some avast! paid services, but this is to be expected from free software. You can't beat the price."
1,Works good to heighten the volume on my laptop.  Significant improvement over the internally controlled sound on my MBP.
1,I've been using TurboTax for 30 years. It's the only way to go.
0,"If the difference was in Turbo Tax, or the new tax laws, but I had a very difficult and frustrating time finishing my taxes this year.<br />Twice, when entering a 1099, Turbo Tax named me the proprietor of a corporation, which of course, I'm not.<br />Maybe I misunderstood the questions, I'm not really sure. At this point, however, I'll believe work with a CPA next year."
1,"The reboot kills all virus,Have tried them all over the past 15 years once I tried Avast I stopped trying. The security webpage checks help when searching the internet."
1,"I do not have a large payroll, but it works either way.  Large or small.  It is so user friendly and any question or concern I have ever had they are always there to answer my questions.  There is so much of the program that I should use, but do not, only because I have not taken the time to get acquainted with it.  I am glad I chose Quick books and would not trade it."
1,"After researching Office 2010, Amazon had the best price and with free delivery, I had it within a week. I downloaded it on two of three computers that can be done and it was seamless and easy to do without tech. help needed.  Haven't tried all the new stuff that comes with it but it is pretty easy to learn.  Just keep pointing and clicking and you'll find whatever you need.  I highly recommend 2010 as a very good upgrade over 2003 and 2007 that I had on two PC's."
1,"For the most part, 2015 is great. Simplified features in almost every area. Except Payroll.<br />What had been easy is now more difficult. Not well labeled. Having to muddle through the process each time and remember where I found certain aspects before. I jumped from 13 to 15."
1,it's easy to use and has protected my pc from many viruses and malware programs--has helped remove add ons that sneak in with wanted downloads
1,I started using Turbo Tax 3 yrs. ago and could not be happier.
1,Simple effective protection that does the job for me.  They also provide a good browser guard that rids my browser of unwanted hijacking of my browsing
1,great
1,"Easy to load, easy to use."
0,It takes so long to actualize my computer....I think it is to heavy.
1,it would have been nice if there had been instructions on how to load the programs on all the computers.
1,"why did I wait so long to buy this!  perfect for my work.  had been using autoCad 2000 if you can believe it.  was afraid I would not be able to work efficiently, but most of the commands are still the same and I have had very little down time"
0,"After adding this product to my computer, my computer now runs 5x slower than it use to. I'm thinking about getting rid of it and just coughing up the money for another one."
1,I had used Turbo Tax for years and while this was not as easy on the eyes it did the trick. For the price I would gladly use this to do my taxes again. Very happy with the product.
1,"My Home & Business arrived today, 11/28/14.  Installed easily and an upgrade was waiting for pickup.  Looks to be anther winner.  I was able to easily transfer my 2013 data, then, poking around the forms, I opened my Five Year Tax History Report - a nice little roadmap of the past which gives us comparisons as where we have traveled and how 2014 might shake out.  I see, with his personal email provided, a Turbo Tax representative is onboard the Amazon site to observe, and to respond to questions. Nice touch. ALWAYS continue to improve Turbo Tax.  For me, Change is Welcomed.  If you do not grow (change) Turbo Tax, then your business model will fail. (i.e. sadly, think, JC Penney)  For 99 percent of us, we are not going to switch to any other tax preparation program, or leave electronic filing.  Over many years, Turbo Tax has treated me as a responsible citizen who wants to use electronics to compute, then pay my taxes."
0,"I ordered this download from Amazon and they sent a product key that didn't work. I was on the phone with tech support for at least two hours and insisted on getting a different product key. After 6 hours trying to diagnose the problem, they determined my product key was not functional and gave me a new one. I was amazed at the incompetence of the Microsoft support staff. Not only did they determine my problem 6 hours after I told them what the problem was to begin with, it took another day just to get a functional product key. My advice to you is if you have any problems installing it, contact Amazon right away and try to get a refund. It will save you the trouble. Now that I've been using the program, it freezes up every now and again. I'm surprised it hasn't crashed yet."
0,"I used Quicken from 1990 until 2000 when I switched to MS Money.  At that time, I had encountered a bug in the Quicken program.  After spending countless hours with Intuit Tech Support (Including Paid Support), I was told that there was, in fact, a bug in the program.  Intuit's solution?  Upgrade to the latest version at MY expense!  I told them if I was going to spend money on new Personal Finance software it would be MS Money and that's exactly what I did.<br /><br />I have been a happy MS Money user (with no bugs) since 2000.  I recently purchased Quicken 2013 Home & Business for the promise of being able to enter transactions from my iPhone and have them sync through the cloud to the desktop Quicken program.<br /><br />It has been an empty promise!<br /><br />The Quicken cloud sync locks up the Quicken desktop program every time I use it and Quicken must be \\""killed\\"" from the Windows Task Manager.  Again, I spent hours with Intuit Tech Support only to have them escalate my case, have me send them several log files from my PC, and tell me it would be a few weeks for a solution.  It has now been over 5 weeks with no response!!!  Unacceptable!!!<br /><br />Intuit only cares about getting your money, not supporting their customers!  It will be interesting to see how they respond to their 60 Day Money Back Guarantee...<br /><br />I have tried several other options for MS Money besides Quicken.  I have found MS Money Sunset and Catamount Software's Pocket Money for the iPhone to be the best solution for my needs.  I have also found the Python Scripts for MS Money (search for MS Money Pocketsense Python Scripts) useful for updating stock prices.  While I was initially under the misconception that MS Money could no longer import account data, this is NOT true!  You can still import *.qif or *.ofx files in MS Money Sunset... It is just a manual (rather than fully automatic) process like we all used to do not too long ago.  Best of all, my personal financial data is not out there on someone's cloud just waiting to be hacked along with thousands of others!<br /><br />I gave Quicken more than a fair chance - twice...  I'm sticking with MS Money!"
1,This is a safe download without attached adds or viruses.
0,Downloaded twice then gave up on what happened.  Disgusted.
0,"It's still charging for state, even though it claims you get one.  Worst representation. I'm finally done with TT."
1,"Easy, very helpful, got refund in a few weeks.  My third year using Turbo Tax. I like it. Recommend it."
0,Spent over 2 days with Tomtom support trying to get the code activated. Conclusion is that the code will NOT work with the Tomtom 140.
0,"I could not get this to work, so I went to TopOCR's web Site. Its is plainly stated there that it is not compatible with Windows7. I'm not saying that Amazon didn't say that somewhere, just that is wasn't obvious to me. Along these lines, it is next to impossible to resolve something like this to<br />get a credit for a bad purchase. All in all, BUMMER!!"
1,"Very easy and convenient download. Other than this comment, office is essentially like any other office just updated. I just really appreciated the quick and easy download."
1,"I had a big issue last year intalling this in my computer but since this year I bought only the code, I had zero issues with this."
1,"Nice purchase, works good."
0,doesn't work with the newest operating system
1,This year I tried Turbo Tax on sale; I ended up deleting their program and buying H&R Bloc again.
1,I have used Avast for years and I am very satisfied with the protection to provides all my computer systems and mobile devices.
0,Sometimes it doesn't respond when you toggle it on and you make a video only to discover it isn't actually recording. Other that that it does do a good job when it works.
1,I have used Norton 360 for years and consider it the best.  Was easy to download and install from Amazon.com.
1,"I know a lot of people have said they don't like this program, but I really love it. I used to use Microsoft Money but when they discontinued I was out of luck. I bought Quicken and couldn't believe how easy it is to use!"
1,"After buying TurboTax for the first time several years ago, I've found how much easier taxes are to do with it instead of without it and plan to buy it again next year.  The telephone support is great, too -- and the consultants I've talked to have gone over-and-above the call of duty to discover the solution to my particular situation.  It's also way cheaper than marriage therapy - and the relative ease of filling in the forms/ answering the questions really makes me a lot easier to live with when it's time to do the taxes!"
1,So much better than the earlier Mac 2011 version that I was using.  Much easier to accomplish what needs to be done.
0,"Would you go from owning you home to renting it if you had to pay the full price for it, every year? No, I didn't think so. That's what the CC pricing structure does with Dreamweaver. It was bad enough that our local, European price was twice the price of the US customers, but this takes the cake. It's a very good, if somewhat buggy code editor once you get over the bias against tools that contain a WYSIWYG part you don't need, but the price is not right. We will be abandoning Dreamweaver professionally eventually. Adobe's greed ruined this product as well as it's own brand name. There are plenty of alternatives, and none at this abdominal pricing structure.<br /><br />1/5, would not rent again."
0,"For 99% of home users, the only feature that you'll use in 8.1 Pro that's not in 8.1 Standard is Windows Media Center.<br /><br />If you used Windows Media Center in Windows 7 (where it was included with Home), it's the same offering here. Unfortunately Microsoft realized how useful it was and pulled it out of Standard and put it in Pro.<br /><br />If you can't live w/o Media Center, then you're dropping almost $100 just for that one feature. If you don't use Media Center, then there's no reason to buy this upgrade."
0,I thought it would be closer to the way Microsoft office worked.  It took a while for you to get some of the features going.
1,It does an excellent job. Still the best on the market.
0,"After being a faithful customer for more years than I can count, I'm moving on. Whoever thought up these &#34;improvements&#34; should be fired. The public is not as gullible as Intuit seems to think."
0,"The only reason I upgraded was the \\""redesigned\\"" property and debt features. Well there is no point because I spent hours trying to download credit card accounts and entering loans. The software takes forever to connect and you can not even select the type without it erasing your selection when you click next and saying please select and account type over and over. This product was clearly not ready for production. Wish you could get a refund on this since its such garbage.   On another note that was basically the only \\""new\\"" feature and it doesn't work. No interface changes, no functionality as promised, such as \\""faster importing\\"".   Very disappointing..."
0,Was unable to download and no refund received!
0,"Worked well as a video editing tool, and burns DVDs well.  But it would not work with my USB video capture device (a Startech SVID2USB2) no matter what I tried.  I found that the Startech device worked well with both Debut and Windows Media Encoder.  I'm using Window Media Encoder to capture a bunch of VHS videos, then using VideoStudio to edit and burn DVDs.  So far I've gone through about 25 VHS tapes with good results."
0,Pretty good program.
0,"Just upgraded to Quicken 2014 and the first thing that is gone .... which I use 2--3 times per week .... is the report you can generate after downloading transactions to your Bank for making payments ???? Also, when I go to reconcile an account .... I get this Blue spinning wheel after clicking on every transaction I am trying to reconcile ....????<br /><br />So far ... poor to fair rating"
0,Sometimes they interrupt with a message that might seem &#34;dangerous&#34; to continue and then they tell me all good. I can't update to cover more security at a price but thanks for offer. Have other security systems.
1,I've have used them for a long time..i would recommend them to all. I tell all my friends about it always.
0,"I have a brand new lap top that was really, really fast.  Since I installed this program it takes forever to open chrome and has slowed down the internet seriously.  What is even more annoying is when this program updates, it will radomly without warning shut the computer down and erase whatever you are working on!  AVOID THIS PROGRAM!!! I am going to have to pay an IT guy to fix my computer now!  Not only is this a waist of $ it is costing more $ to fix my BRAND NEW COMPUTER!!!  AHHHHH!"
1,"This software is really great - I have it installed on my company PC and use it frequently to capture images of websites/presentations/etc. It's incredibly well designed and easy to use. I found using my home PC (Macbook) that I could use it pretty frequently. I'm certain it actually does more than I use it for, so I'm looking forward to exploring more features. You can't beat the ability to download it after purchase."
1,Got this for my PC and my MacAir!! was having trouble functioning without it and all is good again!!
1,Excellent tax software. The UI is very intuitive and the flow is great so that even a beginner can file taxes. I have been using this tax software for years and it has worked for me every time. Will switch to another software if they are as intuitive as TurboTax.
0,"Could not download so they had to manually download, told me I needed to have a tech clean my comp. and that I had a lot of threats, wanted $199.99, I told them I could not afford that and didn't understand because my comp. was only 2 months old as was protected by Norton that came with comp. I kept getting pop-ups, to by stuff from so when it was close to my husband security running out on his new comp., I bought avast protection for 3 comp. $32.09. About a week or two later he tried to download avast, same thing had to get them to manually do it and they told him, he had all kind of viruses and a malware and they could not download untill he had a tech clean up his comp. at $197.99. I told them I paid for 3 comp. and 1 license and if they couldn't download them I wanted a refund. They said I would have to send ticket, I did #ID ESR 213-31054. I became afraid and bought Norton security for our computors. Finally received a reply from a Vladimir Hornicek, Cistomer Service Supervisor, telling me to try to download it again, I explained in my ticket that I had already bought and downloaded Norton with no problem that I wanted a refund. Tried to reply back to him and none of the e-mails were valid, so here someone is stuck with $32.09. Please dont let avast do you this way, we were so afraid our comp. would be messed up, Norton said we did not have any viruses or any wares."
1,"We've purchased TurboTax from several other retailers and brick & mortar stores over the last 10 years or so, when it had a separate version called MacInTax. For the last 5 years we've used Amazon exclusively because of the best price and guarantee if there were a problem. Here's a tip - buy TurboTax as soon as you see ads for it! Why so early? Because you'll get the best discount! Many folks wait until later because they don't want to download updates. But here's the deal - there will always be updates until the last minute! Even if you buy and file on 15 April, the last check TurboTax does is with their website to see if your version is up to date. Besides, Intuit produces millions, that's right, MILLIONS of DVDs with the basic version whether they sell in January or April of that Tax Year. Anyway, TurboTax's consistency and Amazon's excellent purchaser satisfaction is what keeps us from buying anywhere else!"
1,"Snagit is a very useful tool for capturing any screen video, system audio, or voice audio. The quality is perfect. The Snagit interface is easy to use, and provides a wizard to help you through the process. I love this app."
1,"It works with anybody. If you are a starter or pro at editing, this is the best product to use.<br />I did not know how to edit videos, I got this and it works perfectly.<br /><br />You can basically use this for anything. And the special effects are great!<br /><br />THANKS Movavi!"
1,"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! Wouldn't be without it!!!! More important than a condom!!!! Keeps me up to date with all the newest upgrades, never ever cost a dime! Not intrusive, or annoying at all, just there!!!! I feel safe with it!!! Don't even worry when I am surfing, it blocks them all!!!"
1,"Very convenient, and I haven't had a problem with viruses yet."
1,"It is very easy to use with good price, which saves us a lot of time and get more tax back!"
1,"It took a while to figure it out, but so far I really like it.  I used Money for years & got a free starter for Quicken & boy what a difference.  So much easier to get."

0,I have had a terrible experience receiving a reply from the vendor attempting to return this product and receive my refund.<br /><br />I have had to put a stop on my credit card that was charged incorrectly.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this product to anyone!
0,was a real pain to get it installed.  Had to go to Norton customer service help department to finally get it to work.  Had a previous norton 360 on my computer and it caused some kind of conflict.  before I used the cd to install and had no problems but this was a download and not sure I would try it again.
1,"Long overdue, but thank goodness Intuit has returned this to us. My only problem is the gap years since Quicken for Mac 2007. Others such as iBank were a poor substitute, but at least provided a bridge until Intuit returned to the Mac platform."
0,The software keeps crashing and not able to use it accordingly.
1,"I've read a lot of good reviews and I've read some bad reviews, so I wanted to clear up some things.  First, let me say, that if you don't know *how* to use software, you've no business reviewing it.  Period.  People reviewing things that don't understand how the product or product class works or reviewing things with the wrong expectation or using something outside it's intended use and then reviewing the product based on that experience are my pet-peeves.  STOP!<br /><br />Ok, now with that out of the way, let's review the software.<br /><br />Security software is well-known for causing systems to run poorly, tying up valuable resources, causing long startup and/or shutdown times, or running at the worst possible, most inconvenient times.<br /><br />This software changes all of that... sets the bar VERY high for the other software in the same class.<br /><br />Under normal conditions, this software uses a whopping 20mb of my ram.  To put it into perspective, my firefox browser uses 185mb and Internet Explorer uses 125mb.  Now granted, I have 16gb of ram, which, admittedly, is overkill, so even if I had 2 or 4 gigs, this software would still run very lightly.<br /><br />I have bounced back and forth between apple products and windows products (I'm NOT a Microsoft fan), and I've never used anti-virus software on any of my macs and never had any issues, but I wouldn't dare do that on my Windows PC.  I often forget that I even have anti-virus software.<br /><br />Ever been doing important important or playing that game, only to start lagging heavily has the hard drive starts chattering away because of the anti-virus software?  Yup, been there.  That doesn't happen anymore.  This software only scans when the system has been idle for awhile.<br /><br />Features I like-<br /><br />-Password vault (I set crazy hard passwords, and I wouldn't even try to remember them)- 1 password opens it and remembers my crazy passwords for me!<br />-Tiny footprint<br />-Doesn't run at inopportune times<br />-Updates silently in the background<br />-Shows safe and unsafe websites on all hits that show up when doing internet searches (i.e. Google)<br />-Prevents unsafe images from displaying on my monitor (in case you didn't know, a picture can have a virus or malware behind it)<br />-Scored VERY high on all review sites<br />-Good price!<br />-All 3 PC's use this software... no need to buy 3 separate licenses.<br />-Inexpensive<br />-FAST scans (granted I'm using it on an SSD and 2 WD Velociraptor 10K RPM drives)<br />-Great tailoring.  Lots of options for making the software do what you want, when you want, how you want (Shouldn't all software do this?)<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />Renewal price is expensive, BUT, as others have stated, purchase the software each year from amazon and just apply the next software key you are given to your current software.  It will add the next 12 months to your subscription and also upgrade the software whenever the next update is available.<br /><br />There is NO reason not to use this software.  AVG is a  TERRIBLE alternative, by the way.  VERY intrusive, resource hog, poorly designed software.  Even the paid version is awful.  Several users I know have told me their horror stories, and I just refer them to NIS."
0,"Download, installation and migration were seamless.  Reason for purchasing newer version was to regain online imports from credit cards, but did resolve issue.  Seems to be growing trend that credit card providers do not facilitate export of data to Quicken.  Would say that perhaps 2013 runs a little faster.  Will continue to use product, works very well with checking and other bank accounts."
1,been using avg for 10 years. best anti virus i've used. does a good job and doesn't take over your computer. have never gotten a virus it didn't identify and eliminate. this is the best deal i've found on it.
0,"Not at all user friendly. If you're not an experienced video editor go with a Corel product. Using this was very, very frustrating."
1,Was great!  I know nothing about taxes but even I could do it!
1,this program was great easy to download and works perfectly.  has all the features as promised.
1,"I have been using all of Inspyder software for a while now and I am totally happy with it. It is a great value, it is easy to use, and they have great support!"
0,I have been using TurboTax Deluxe for many many years.  I had no problems following the software except when I got to the end where you choose to E-file or mail your forms.  Federal E-file is free but they wanted another $19.99 to E-file the state taxes PLUS $29.99 for processing fee.  I'm not happy with this at all.  I went ahead and Efile my federal and took the mail route for my state taxes.  The title made me think you were getting both federal and state free efiling. I will not be using this next year as you can efile your federal on line for free and I'll just do the mail route with the state taxes.
1,Mostly happy with the product.
1,as expected very practical and custom friendly ant virusprogram
1,I got the free download and it has been protecting my new laptop without problems.  I've been telling my friends about Avast since then. I have no virus on my laptop and I do lots of downloads for school work.
0,"There really aren't very many alternatives to Quicken anymore. I switched from Microsoft Money when that went kaput, and now I'm stuck with this. I'm not into doing everything online even though I'm an internet addict, and the options are really limited for easy to use money management software. Honestly, the only things I use this for are keeping track of my bills and as a check register. I changed my password at my bank, and now the auto update feature doesn't work anymore -- and yes, I changed my password in Quicken. I can still download directly from my bank, though. It does better at keeping track of my money than I do, which isn't really saying much. Overall it's meh, but it works. I just wish it worked better."
1,Love this program
0,As of this time this program will NOT install and is a complete waste of money!!!  this is NOT a cyberlink problem.....BUT is a Amazon problem......hope to update when fixed!!!
1,I ordered the digtal download version of HR Block At Home and the transaction went very smooth.  The SW was immediately available and installed just fine on Windows 7.  I have used this SW for years (was called TaxCut before) and this year's version was great as always...
1,Everybody should read this document and at least know what some of it says.
1,It's so easy and being able to do it @ my liesure is priceless. Purchasing it through Amazon.com just enhances the entire experience.
1,"For the price you pay , you get a lot more features the other leading brand. It does a good job at the deluxe level. The program is a little confusing looking up  facts or info on tax rules and laws, and I usually have to rely on the internet to get the answer.  No problems downloading it at all. I do think the state filing fee is a bit high ."
1,"Downloaded this when my Microsoft Security Essentials went haywire.  Don't plan on changing back to MSE.  Does everything it's supposed to, and am very pleased with it."
1,Great price and prompt delivery.
1,I have used Avast Home Free Antivirus on all my computers (at one time 10 separate machines) for nearly 10 years and have always felt protects.  I recommend it to all my family and friends who are looking for antivirus protection.
0,Looks the same to me just a way to get money for upgrade. The fonts are less bold and appear smaller. The credit score is nice but not a big bonus.
1,"I bought a new laptop recently and when I looked at the cost of purchasing Microsoft products for it, I nearly fell over. I am so glad that I found Apache Openoffice. It has worked flawlessly for me and I highly recommended it!"
1,"Avast provides outstanding internet security, probably the very best available. It is easy to use and seems to prevent almost all potential internet threats."
1,"Best tax program for home use.  I have been using this tax software for many years, also tried a couple of the others out there like tax cut but turbo deluxe is best for getting it done simple and most money back!"
1,Program is very clear easy to understand
1,Use it daily tp edit and download my work. Love the watermark features and the grouping of settings<br />The camera teather feature is super useful with clients.
1,It is a good product.  A lot of powerful tools.  More than most would use.  I would have taken better advantage of the power of this product if my job didn't keep me so busy and quite frankly looking at another computer when I get home is not something I long for.
0,"I've used OpenOffice (equivalent to Apache OpenOffice) extensively and have had no problems with up to the 3.x version, but when I tried AOO 4.0.1 on my Windows 7 laptop it crashed three times in succession as I was trying to work with Impress (the PowerPoint equivalent). I removed it and went back to OOo 3.2 and have had no trouble.<br /><br />Maybe it works better with Windows 8 but I get confused enough going between my 7 and 8 machines. I'll stick with OOo 3.2 on both."
1,"I like the program, even though its' a steep learning curve. Only item I would make others aware of if the Home version, even though it says it supports MS Office, it does NOT support MS Excel - something that is not made very clear :("
0,I've worked with computers for years...did not find this particularly user-friendly at all..personally feel that tutorials would be more useful than the manual or an online community.
1,"Hello,<br /><br />Since upgrading to Windows 8.1, the need to use Outlook and remain compatible with the past document was important. While the updates from 2010 to 2013 still has some quirks, the product does what it claims."
1,"i have used this program for 10 years and would not use anything else, it easy to use and i just love it"
0,"after a lot of searching both on Amazon and on intuits web site I felt certain that I would be able to complete both federal and state taxes and would need to purchase state e-file for 19.95... Nope, they send you to their web site to charge you another 39 bucks to do your state... I will ensure that i never purchase anything again from intuit and probably quite buying on amazon.com if they represent this kind of crap. I spent a lot of time in research and still ended up with what i feared would happen...<br /><br />I have used turbo tax in the last several years and was happy... they have become a rip off don't tell the truth company... buyer beware! I would give them a minus 5 if it allowed me to do so"
0,I COULDN'T GET THIS TO DOWN LOAD PROPERLY
1,This is the second year in a row I've use HR Block and I don't have any complaints.  Good help sections and simple questions make things easy.
0,"I've been using Quicken since 1999. Quicken 2012 is the slowest version yet. When I click on an account (in the left sidebar), it takes between 2-4 seconds to switch to that account. In my previous version (2006), switching was instant. This is so aggravating that I am considering throwing away Quicken 2012 and returning to 2006.  No matter how many fancy features you build, Intuit, you have to get the *basics* right!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-02-23: The slowness remains, even if I create a new Quicken file with only a few transactions in it. I am throwing away this software, returning to Quicken 2006, and lowering my review from 2 stars to 1."
1,"I've been using a version of this software for about 15 years now as its gone through several brand changes.  Its always been easy to use and you can let the software be as verbose as you want it to be or when you are comfortable you can jump in and directly enter data to forms.  The last several years I have been using the download version and the program self extracts and runs.  Unfortunately after it extracts it hasn't been using administrator permissions even though I am logged in as an admin which meant I had to go through a bunch of command line hassle to install it properly.  This may be an issue with my computer config, but I don't have the same issues with other software installs.  Once it installs properly, its solid."
1,"I love this antivirus program. It quickly and smoothly protects my computer from harmful viruses without causing any interruptions or problems. It's super easy to install and gives you options to determine exactly what you want it to do. And again, the best part is you don't get any weird interruptions or glitches while it does its thing! I highly recommend it!"
0,"I hate Intuit--I have used Turbotax for more than 10 years and have had a small consulting practice and investment transactions throughout this period.  Prior to the 2014 version, I would be offered an opportunity to upgrade so the software would provide more support in each of these areas.  As a CPA, I do not need the extra support so declined.  This year I was given no option to even prepare the return if i had Sch C income and the price to upgrade within the application exceeded the difference in price I would have had to pay to buy the &#34;enhanced&#34; version.  This is just highway robbery.  Amazon was great and let me do the exchange for this year.  This will be the last year I use Turbotax.  (PS- the upgraded version really provided no better support; it just cost more)"
1,Basic TT has served me well for many years. A tried and true product. I will use again next year.
0,"installing release 4 (which I was just offered as a live download) seems to have corrected some of these previously reported issues... we'll see.  --------  Serious bugs encountered in first 15 minutes: program hangs downloading transactions from my primary banking website and must be killed in task manager; program crashes downloading transactions from any Schwab brokerage account; reconciliation of credit card account can display transactions that aren't actually in the account register (from whence they come I have no idea); running balance of credit card accounts (sometimes) doesn't correctly update (I added a payment and the calculated balance was wrong until I'd switched to another account and reconciled it and switched back.???). All of these things worked pretty well in Quicken 2014 Premiere. Given the price Intuit charges for these minor updates, one would think they could afford a decent QA process. One might also bitch about the fact that the lousy reviews they continue to get for support -- I've long since learned not to bother calling them myself! -- seems to make no difference to them. If only there were a decent alternative  :-("
0,"Use QD 2014 for the simplest of simple -- Checking, Savings, and Credit Card with one Bank. QD 2014 has consistently been inconsistent, meaning, it will omit some transactions, delete some transactions that had been cleared after a previous download, and will download duplicate transactions with different category. Q support has not been able to help. Q support wants me to buy Q 2015. If Q cannot fix a simple issue in QD 2014, why do they think that more of my money will buy QD 2015 and expect that it works. I'm prompted to write this today after downloading transactions from within the July 2015 time frame, finding the Q balance not matching the Bank balance, then finding the error in June 2013 to be a deleted transaction."
1,Good Product.
1,"I've been a turbotax guy for over a decade. Granted my taxes are rather complicated because I have a business as well as rental properties. However, after I finished doing my taxes with turbo tax, it said I owed $7k for federal. So I proceeded to download H&R software and after another 2 hours, it said that I owed $1K. That's a pretty big deal. I knew turbo tax was wrong because I never paid that much in tax. I'm officially done with turbo tax. Cost twice as much as H&R and can't even get it right."
0,Not thrilled‼️
0,"They lured me away from TURBO-TAX -- to my regret.<br />The H&R Block software was completely useless to me.<br /> Ignored the H&R Block disaster, ordered the Turbo-Tax, and completed my Federal and State returns quickly and easily.<br /> No more H&R Block for me !!"
0,"I have used Audials software for more years than it was called Audials. It was then just called Tunebite version 4,  2006, this was before the video module was introduced . Back then as it is now there always seems to be some module of this software that does not perform as it should.  Today it is using ver. 10, attempting to convert a  DVD to a high resolution Windows media file. The copy process completes successfully, but the convert process fails. I do not recall every failure in every version, but I do recall never being able to find a solution, or relevant help, only the promise of bigger and better things in the next new version. There is seldom a lack of emails promising the latest, and the greatest.  This was adequate software when I could find DMR music to convert, but with a lack of available materials now-a-days, I have been disappointed with it the last several years."
1,"I upgrade every 2 years, and the 2010 edition couldn't handle accounts where I had more than just a few years worth of data. That was an issue with brokerage accounts mostly, since those go back 10+ years.<br /><br />This one works great, I just use the basic capabilities and haven't had any problems. The fact that they turn off on-line acct syncing after 2 years is really obnoxious, but there's really no alternative software unless you want to put everything on-line."
1,It is simple and effective. Does not consume your ram.
1,Meets expectations
0,"Being a previous Turbo Tax customer, I saw the price of this online download and purchased since it included the efile for state and federal. Well- if you value your time- don't waste it by downloading this!!! It takes hours to download- like 3+ having DSL & then not knowing, I thought that since I was a previous user of Turbo Tax - it would transfer my data from previous year to this filing. This feature did not work- it filled your basic info like name & address- that was it. This product was a HUGE disappointment.  Turbo Tax online is MUCH BETTER and will be my next purchase this time next year. It cost a bit more $$$$ but worth it in the time that I spent waiting for the piece of explative software to downlaod and then had multiple updates. If this was my 1st time using Turbo Tax- it would have been my last. But since I have tried this product in the past and now know the differences between the Amazon version and the version directly from TurboTax.com- I will be going directly back to the website and pay the extra fees. This program is a complete ripoff of peoples time!!!!  Again BE WARNED!!!"
1,Seems to do the job.  Doesn't slow the computer. Doesn't require a lot of user interface. Cheaper to buy new from Amazon and insert product key in existing software.
1,"I've been using another very well known tax software for quite a few years, but lately the price has been going up and features have been moved to even higher priced versions.  On my brother's recommendation, I tried H&R Block this year.  It's easy to use, it does almost anything you'd need (if you don't operate a business) and it's under fifteen bucks for the downloaded version.  My bank offers the other software to use online for free, but if you need anything more than a 1040-EZ, it costs you close to $50.  This one even includes (more than one) E-File for no extra charge.  If you own a business or have unusual investments or the like, you'll probably need to go with a more advanced version, but if you're a working stiff like me the Basic version works fine.  Unlike the other guys, you can itemize your deductions at no extra charge.<br /><br />  This product does Federal taxes only; they give the option of State taxes as well, though it's quite a bit more money.  Fortunately, my State has a very good online program which is free."
1,"Simple excellent program.  Have not had any issues like it says 360 protection all the way around.  Internet, files, registry, full on capable."
0,I have been useing Quicken for aproximately 5 years without updating and have been very happy.  Since I have updated to 2013 II cannot update my Chase accounts and it is more complicated to enter bills.  It seems like this version is not as user frendly. I may have to switch a different program.
0,"The product is over priced for what I need.  Last year it cost $69.99 with a $15.00 discount for a purchase price of $54.99.  This year it cost $74.99 with a $10.00 discount for a purchase price of $64.99.  All I want is the checking account function.  I do not own smartphone so that feature is useless to me. I also do not use the investment feature either.  I am paying for features that I do not use.  Quicken should offer a version without all the \\""Bells and Whistles\\"".  Since it is the only software on the market that many banks recognize for automatically downloading transactions they can pretty much charge what they want.  I have been a loyal Quicken customer for 20+ years. I have returned Quicken 2014 and went back to using Quicken 2013."
1,"I spent my whole life using Office.  When my MacBook Air arrived, I used Pages and Numbers.  They're fine, but most older versions of Office cannot convert or open the files, so this is potentially is big waste of time if you have to do a project going to a Windows user."
1,"Overall, I like Quicken 2015 for Mac. It is not as complete as far as features on Quicken for Windows. It does have all the features I need. I did not use all the Quicken for Windows, and Quicken for Mac has all the core features that I think most people would need.<br /><br /> I switched to Mac a couple of years ago, and started using Mint. I love Mint. However, it does not have the capability of reports. And, it does not have the ability to attach receipts, or documents to transactions. The reason I bought Quicken for Mac was to utilize these features. I still use Mint, and will continue to use both Mint and Quicken. For some reason, Quicken will not automatically download my bank transactions, and Mint does. Since Intuit sells both products I guess I do not understand that. And, a couple of times the manual download from my bank did not completely download all transactions. I do not know if that is Intuit's flaw, or the bank's. The mobile Quicken app for iPhone is poor. However, Mint's mobile app is very good."
1,Have used Turbo Tax for years and never had any problems will not use any this else you cant got wrong with this product
1,Great product!
0,"It bought this one after my kaspersky was expired, but norton has slowed down the system. It is protecting well and cleaning up the pc regularly but it's a very heavy application."
1,"This is a wonderful series for children especially if they like to use the computer.  They can color to their hearts content and then erase and start over or if they like their drawing and want to keep it,  it can be printed out.  My grandson enjoys it immensely especially since he can experiment and color whatever color he desires."
1,PERFECT!
0,"I had been using Turbo Tax Basic (usually less than $20) for about 15 years.  It did everything, including small business, capital gains, and installment sales.  WalMart didn't have the Basic when I bought this year so I paid $45 for the Deluxe version.  I was really disappointed to find it would not allow a very simple small business return.  Turbo Tax offered to update the product if I called them, but I had already gotten a free download from H&R Block and was able to complete my return easily.  Not sure which brand I'll be buying next year."
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for a few years. I find it easy to use, and cheaper than using professional preparers. Well satisfied"
0,"It works great, but it takes too long to update itself and slows the system"
1,"We have been using the online version for a number of years, last year we purchased the full version and the same this year. It is very comprehensive, its like having a CPA setting across from you. The program find use deductions that were unknown to us, and the audit provides the extra bit of confidence."
0,I can't figure out how to register it and the reminder keeps popping up.  Annoying
1,This is a very good product. I like the automatic back up and the information it sends to me about the status of my computers security.  I'm going  to stick with Norton.
1,"For starters, I downloaded the free version of Sweet Home 3D - Works very well for a free home based architectural drawing software/3D tool. Except for the trouble I had trying to figure out how to reverse the door hinge, everything else on the tool worked easily and without the need to read instructions or look for help outside the menu. Has a decent stock set of furniture/furnishings too."
0,too many problems that pertain to reconcile. It does not match what is online and wont let me override the issue and support staff does not understand English.
0,"Considering I got it for free, I don't have much room to complain about it. However, when you put it next to any top tier editing program, Sony Movie Studio 13 pales in comparison."
1,My computer previously had 13 viruses on it......NONE since I have used AVAST!
0,"The prior 1-star reviews say it all:  one of the worst software rollouts of all time.  Discontinued support (and functionality) of prior version, Quicken Essentials for Mac (which was great, BTW), forcing users to the new 2015 version.  Putting aside issues with a less appealing user interface, the root of the problem is simple:  the software just doesn't work.  Transaction dialogue box states transactions downloaded, but then none show up under individual accounts.  Work around is to delete linkages then reestablish linkages, daily per each account (one at a time).  Neat, fun.  Absolutely no contact info for Support - just user forums.  This from a publicly traded company?  Wow.  Where can I get a refund?  Better yet, maybe I should start crowdfunding for developing a functioning competing product."
0,VERY difficult and confusing to purchase and use - move on
1,"I like free antivirus. This one free for 1 year, I think it's enough for me. Thanks Avast for it."
1,"I've been a user of Quickbooks for many years (and many versions).  So far, have not had any issues with this version."
0,says you can download from your financial instate but really you can't.  I can't get this to work at all.
1,"The software is great, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Had difficulty w/some of the tax language.  With more patience on my part, I could have found all the answers I needed."
1,"The vocals sound great when you listen to them, but once you post them on your &#34;bar&#34; of music composing, it sounds broken or scratchy.  Does someone know how to fix that?  Is there a download that can fix this?<br /><br />This is a great software but it could be friendlier.  I have noticed that it changes the instruments on me when I upload the song.  Make sure you have a back up."
0,"I purchased this software to use with an account on our computer which does not have administrative privileges.  The program will not sync from this account, and it won't save if I sync from another account.  Also, it opens on start up even when this option is turned off.  I wouldn't recommend this software if you have multiple users on your computer."
1,"I have been using Avast for years, I have even loaded it on friends machines when they have grief. Once a boot scan is run on there machines, they are surprised what Avast has removed."
0,"I'm so disappointed. I switched to a Mac this year, and bought the Quicken version and am beyond frustrated.  Any customer service has to be done via a chat, which most of the time you just sit there while they say &#34;I see&#34; or &#34;Let me research that for you&#34;<br /><br />I can't update my account, I can't delete my account, and I can't do a screen shot to show them anything.<br /><br />So now my option is to uninstall and start over, loosing all of my work.<br /><br />I highly advise staying away from this version, and putting your hard earned money to use somewhere else.<br /><br />This was a failure."
0,"Worked for filing my taxes, but I was disappointed that I couldn't find a way to have it access my information on the H&R Block website."
1,Seemlessly converted all my PC office files on to my Mac. It handled all my spreadsheet formulas and formatting.  Far exceeded iNumbers. Well worth the money.
1,"I have used this program to create Easter & Christmas scavenger hunts for my kids & grandkids. It is wonderfully fun! The clues have a wide range...great for young kids & for adults, as well. If you don't care for the clues, you can create your own. (It's very user friendly, too.) The hunts have become the highlight of our annual Easter Egg Hunt and our Christmas celebration. I consider it to be an awesome investment in fun & memories."
1,I would recommend  this to anyone. This has helped our business in many different ways. I am very pleased and love the organization and ease of access for our records.
1,As Described
1,"If you want competent tax preparation, and do not want to pay a tax preparer, and can spend a few hours; this is your solution.  I like the way it allows you to go back and change things you forgot or just found as you pull your records together."
1,Very easy to use I highly recommend it.
1,Do I really have to say why???
1,"Program works even better than expected.<br /><br />Only 1 issue that I have. When you add more than 5 tabs to the spreadsheet, the program had a hard time reloading pages. And the program crashed."
1,"First, let me say a word about &#34;reviews&#34;. You have to take them all with a grain of salt, if you know what I mean. I have made purchases in the past, which I was very pleased with. But before I made the purchase, I almost decided not to because of negative reviews. So I found that when I compared the actual product with the negative review, the problem wasn't the product at all. It was the ignoramus who posted the negative review. Just because some people can't pour milk out of a jug, without someone else taking the lid off for them, does not mean there's a defect in the milk jug.<br />  Now, I've only had this Quicken download for a few days. But I have nothing but good to say about it. It does what it is supposed to. It won't open your milk jug, but it will do a great job at balancing your check book. That's all I wanted. And I got a bonus which I didn't expect. And didn't know I would get.<br />  I discovered, if you do on line banking, that this program (with your permission), will connect to your bank, and balance your check book with the bank, pronto. No more comparing your register with the bank register to see what transaction has cleared, etc. That feature alone was worth the cost of the download.<br />  Companies are good at building great products. What they are &#34;not&#34; good at, is being a good salesperson. Of all the stuff I read in the product descriptions, I never once read where it would (with the click of a mouse), balance my checkbook with the bank. To me, that should be one of the top few reasons to purchase. It would have sold me in a heartbeat."
1,"I've bought downloads from Amazon in the past and never had a problem.  For some reason I had a little problem with downloading CS6.  After it was figured out, though, I immediately started to use it.  Phenomenal program - I don't know how I edited without it!"
0,Worse product ever - their update locked up due to their poor design and I had to startover.....  DO NOT BUY
1,Works pretty well similar to Turbo Tax.  Very good customer support when contacted via a chat room.  Solved my problem very efficiently.
1,"Provides great free protection. Haven't gotten a virus even with all the downloading I do. The ads that pop up to buy more features for the product get annoying, though."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I have used this software for at least 10 years and have had no issue.  This year was a completely different story.  It tells you to update the software, you update the software and it tells you the same thing over and over again.  You CANNOT complete your returns at all.  Called support and was &#34;escalated&#34; 3 times, the last person telling me they would call back within 24 - 48 hours - yeah right!  Never heard from them again and do not want to spend another 2 hours with them to accomplish nothing.  Bought another program - TAXACT - and would highly recommend it - cheaper and at least dependable.  I don't even know how to get my money back.  Again - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,This product has protected my computer with little or no effort on my part. I recommend this product to everyone.
1,Very easy to use...
0,"Was getting ready to purchase Turbo Tax Basic; have used and recommended it for over a decade.  Then I read the reviews;  no schedule D, no  1099 capabilities!!  Intuit, you blew it!"
0,"My original comments were vandalized, either by Amazon or H&R Block.     The H&R Block software calculated my return at $2300, but when I hit send to e-file, the total went to $0 and the saved form shows $0 refund. After an hour of waiting on the phone, giving up, and waiting several more hours on the chat line (You are 43 in line, a representative will be with you right away), customer service, if that is indeed what we can all agree to pretend to call it, told me that the problem was mine to work out with the IRS. Thanks H&R Block!     I requested a supervisor and she thought I was complaining about not getting a refund. But $0 is a rare refund. The IRS knows that even a small refund perpetuates the game. My refund was $650 before I started to add credits and deductions. So, the lack of understanding, for whatever reason, made things worse, if the word worse even applies.     The maximum refund guarantee, by the way, is a scam. It is not the difference between returns, but, perhaps, a refund on the product after you jump through their hoops. That, of course, means you must  re-do your taxes with a different product(after buying it) or in person (and pay them), because you need documentation. In my case, I have to re-do my taxes anyway, so I will seek the product refund. I'll let you know how that works out.    Update: A similar review of mine on this subject has been \\""moderated\\"" twice from the H&R site. Perhaps they should move a moderator or two to the customer service center instead of defending a flawed product with censorship. Just sayin'    Update: I have the entire transcript from the chat session and will post it someday soon, but I have wasted enough time on this for one weekend. I need to do my taxes, AGAIN.    Do NOT buy this product."
1,First time using the downloaded version. It worked great.
0,"The instructions and tutorials are poor,especially for a new user. A 5 minute video takes  1 1/2 hrs to &#34;make a movie&#34;. I would return it, but Amazon won't let me...Avoid!!!!!"
1,Downloaded this so my son would have something he could use to do his school work and I didn't want to spend the money it would have cost for Microsoft Office.  This software works great and he is able to do what he needs to do.
0,"I have never reviewed an amazon product before but I felt compelled to do so in this case. I have used turbo tax for years on windows. It always worked fine. This year I purchases tt for Mac OS. It simply does not work as advertised. You cannot e-file unless the product is completely up to date, and the product always thinks there are updates pending. I spent an hour and a half at least on the phone with their tech support, 2 if you count wait time. We tried many things including emptying the trash which I did not really want to do. Nothing worked. Nothing. I will have to file by mail, I guess. Since it does at least work in this regard, I gave 2 stars instead of 1."
1,The best - good improvements this year.  Highly recommend.
1,"great product, easy to use."
0,"Since installing it for 3.5 months I have had 2 .dll issues.  One Glary fixed, the other one &#34;File not found: VBA6.DLL&#34; needs registry edits and downloads that Microsoft will not allow.  Looks like I'd have to do a complete reinstall of Windows 7 and all programs to fix it.  UUUgh!!!"
1,"Lots of nice features that my old 2006 version did not have.  Works well, no glitches, but I do not synch with online banking as others do.  Buying the download instead of the CD saves money, and if you have to re-load the program, you do it through Amazon is what I'm told.  Haven't had to do that."
1,"I know it's so wrong, but keeping the finances in order is my least favorite part of my business, and so what happens??  I ignore it!  A good friend got me to change my strategy and use quickbooks online.  I signed up for a merchant account, linked directly to my bank accounts and just yesterday did my first set of invoices online.  It was awesome!! Quick, simple and sent via email ... even accepted a payment an hour later in QB. Why did I wait so long???"
1,"I usually panic every year when I have to update my virus protection. The panic is because I know that I have to go to Norton's website to get a removal tool to remove any previous versions of Norton or other antivirus software (which usually doesn't work).  The result is having to try the download like five or six times before I make any progress. In addition to download blues, the previous version I had was Norton 360.  I figured I'd be tied up for the next couple of days getting Security to work.  Well, finally, Norton built the removal tool into the download, and it actually removed 360 without hiccups.  I couldn't believe how well it worked!  Norton still takes awhile to download, but it's a good excuse to fix lunch while you monitoring the download process.  It was a bit trickier to download to my tablet (hence, the four star rating).  I had to use my computer and go to the Norton website to make sure Norton was installed on the tablet.  I guess I thought the icon for the tablet would be the same as the one on my laptop.  Oh, well, can't have everything."
0,This did not work on either my (older) mac or my (newish) tablet.
1,"I've been using Norton for many years, and have found it to be easy to install and seamless to use.  I do wait until I can get a lower cost version than suggested by the Symantec site.  No problems with the program."
1,Easy to use and process return; satisfied.
0,"this template is a scam like all the others template<br />they should be reported<br />completly scam<br />why paying 50$ ,200$ for these templates with some useless sample ,SBA offer for free a  much valuable template"
1,Four stars because I can't use it as well as I would like. It takes some effort to learn all their functions
0,"I've used TurboTax for years now. This year's version was not quite as fluid as previous versions. Also, I file my mother-in-law's taxes for her. It is disappointing how they handle their free version. I ended up doing her's with TaxSlayer. I will look at TaxSlayer next year for my needs as well."
1,"A classic, works great.  Pay attention to which version you buy, as opposed to what you need, though."
1,amazon price was fantastic company upgrade to premier was also fantastic. software worked perfectly. I hope turbo tax return to deluxe for capital gains and stocks and not the price of premier.
1,"I have used Avast for years.  Excellent product and keeps improving.  I have it on all of my pc, tablet, and phone."
0,"Why oh why did they update the Goals interface in 2015?<br />I can note several things wrong with the view of Savings Goals<br />1. You can't sort them, and now you have to scroll through pages and pages of &#34;visual blocks&#34;, each one representing a goal and try and see if you can see the title of each &#34;block&#34; to know if it's the Savings Goal you're looking for. I've scrolled up and down the list several times trying to find the Goal I'm looking for until finally finding it. This is VERY frustrating<br />2. If your progress on a Goal is low, you can't see the amount of money already contributed to the goal because the amount numbers show inside the progress bar. If there isn't enough of a progress bar to fit the numbers in it, you can't see the amount. There is no other way to know unless you open the &#34;withdraw&#34; pop-up and then check each account that you've contributed to this goal from and add them in your head, or on a calculator. Useless.<br />3. The ability to scan across all goals and see most of goals (depending on how large your list is) like you could in 2012 is gone. No easily comparing accounts and where you might want to put extra money to allocate. You have to scroll pages and pages and pages and try and remember each amount to determine where you might stash the extra cash you have available to allocate to goals (similar problem with the scrolling as mentioned in #1)<br />4. If you've scrolled pages and pages to finally find the goal you're interested in and you want to edit it, you click the edit goal and nice pop up comes up similar to 2012. However whether you &#34;ok&#34; or &#34;cancel&#34;, or even click the &#34;red x&#34; to close this pop up, it will return you to the goal list and refresh the entire view and return you to the top of the list. UGH! Now I have to scroll back down the list again to find the goal I was working on. HOW FRUSTRATING!<br /><br />If you like working with the concept of Savings Goals like I do. Stay away from this version like the plague!"
1,Glad for instant download!
0,"Ahh... Another year, another version of Quicken. Another round of hopes and expectations (better budgeting? better UI? fewer crashes? Mint.com integration?) only to be dashed by yet another coat of lipstick on a certain specimen of Artiodactyla. But more on this below.<br /><br />TL;DR: no, you don't need to upgrade, unless your version is clearly inferior in performance or features (my previous Quicken version \\""magically\\"" stopped downloading transactions from my bank and I took a chance to see if this worked with the new version. It did). You will be getting the same Quicken you've seen over the last 6-8 years, only with new number on the logo picture and a mobile client.<br /><br />First things first: this time Intuit actually managed to introduce a \\""feature\\"" so bad, it is universally abhorred. I'm talking about balloon pop-ups. Want to confirm a newly downloaded transaction? You better have really good mouse handling reflexes (some experience with online FPS games might come handy). If you linger for more than a half a second on any of the fields in the register, a pop-up will spring up, showing pretty much the same details about the transactions you already see in the register anyway. This pop-up will \\""freeze\\"" the UI for about 2-3 seconds. Same goes for changing the record detail. Same with changing the status. And of course, as it always is with such brilliant innovations, there is no way to turn it off.<br /><br />Back to the big picture: in the best Quicken tradition, innovation means updating the logo with the new 2014 year and throwing in \\""new features\\"" that are as innovative as different brands of toilet paper. You typically get an all-around exciting features like \\""ability to attach images of receipts to transactions\\"" and \\""new and improved budgeting.\\"" and that's about it. Surely, this time around there is a mobile client, but it is hardly the biggest thing the product lacked.<br /><br />The UI is still the same, and that is not a compliment. Quicken's UI violates most common sense rules we've come to accept with Windows-based programs. Arrow keys behave differently. Control-A doesn't select all editable text. Esc doesn't dismiss pop-up windows. I can go on and on. Granted, a big part of this idiosyncratic behavior is for backward compatibility with ancient versions of the product, but the problem of handling different UI behaviors was solved many times over (WordStar, anyone?) and nothing prevents (from a technical standpoint) Intuit from updating UI to conform to Windows guidelines and have the \\""traditional\\"" behavior switchable as an option.<br /><br />Investment accounts are still a major pain to deal with. I mean, somehow Quicken thinks that as an investor, when I navigate to an account, the very first thing I want to see is the list of transactions. Not the holdings (must click on a button to see it and then click again to dismiss - did I mention that Esc key is overrated?), not the account performance - the transactions. And woe to you if you happen to have two different accounts backed by the same financial organization (in my case, 529 accounts are backed by Vanguard, where I also have a \\""regular\\"" account) - chances are, only one of these accounts will be able to download transactions because Quicken has a notion of \\""one org, one set of credentials.\\""<br /><br />Report engine is still untouched. Which means your choice of presentation is limited to \\""do you want a pie chart with your order?\\""  Forget about showing trends or suppressing non-trending categories, or sparklines or any other things that happened to data presentation over the last 15 years. I'm not even talking about such excesses as scheduled reports highlighting weekly or  monthly trends.<br /><br />The product is still in the age of one PC per household. Of course, I can install Quicken on all of my laptops and desktops but the concept of hosting the Quicken data file on a shared drive is still a non-starter: there are no guarantees it won't get corrupted and with my financial history I'm not too adventurous to try.<br /><br />The budget system is still too convoluted for its own good. I can [possibly] handle rather complex budget requirements but having something as simple and useful as setting monthly spending limits on categories and showing how close I am to that limit when I add or edit a transaction (something Microsoft Money was doing more than 10 years ago) is not available. Neither are scheduled security purchasing transactions (also something Money did well for many years).<br /><br />When Intuit acquired Mint.com and its founder became head of the Quicken product, there was a lot of excitement and hope for innovation. 4 years have passed and none of that materialized. Quicken and Mint are still separate, completely disconnected worlds. Quicken changes from release to release are laughable; it still relies on bleeding its customers with mandatory upgrades  every 3 years (if they use online transactions). Overall, the product is stuck in an un-virtuous cycle, where lack of innovation results in lack of interest, which in turn translates to mediocre revenue and thus in less potential to innovate. Granted, there are several new players on the market, so not all hope is lost and I really hope that someone, someday comes up with a product that is truly innovative and makes using it easy, fun, and helpful.rrupted and with my financial history I'm not too adventurous to try.<br /><br />The budget system is still too convoluted for its own good.

1,"I have been a faithful user of Turbotax for several years, but after reading about the problems with it this year (see reviews in Amazon) I decided to try TaxAct 2014. It worked well. The interview process was pretty simple. The help tips may not quite be as in depth as TurboTax but they worked for me.<br />One thing that I hope gets improved with this program (significantly expanded) is the Donation Assistant app. Turbotax has one that is significantly better as far as size of database and number of priced items. I use this when I go to drop off all kinds of stuff at Goodwill and it really adds up. Many items are not yet included in Donation Assistant for pricing so I used &#34;Other&#34; for a lot of items. I had the program crash while going from the &#34;Other&#34; category back to the main multiple times so remember to save your return before using Donation Assistant and certainly before using the &#34;other&#34; category."
0,"I have used Quicken Home for years and been happy with its functions..  When we decided to upgrade our version, we added the Business piece to help us with bookkeeping on some rental property we own.  I work in accounting, so I am familiar with the entries and reports involved.  This program was confusing to set up and I am still trying to get an Income Statement report to generate.  It was frustrating!  I would not recommend this for anyone who understands normal accounting functions."
1,I have used TurboTax for 4 years and love it!  It is very easy to use.  You just answer each question as it is presented.  Every category is easy to understand as additional info is available to explain possibilities.
1,"I used Quicken for many years on my Dell, which crashed and without much preparation I bought a Mac Air and subsequently Quicken for Mac.  We had trouble getting the Quicken files (from the 2009 version) from my back up drive converted into the right format for Quicken for Mac.  Eventually Quicken customer service sent us a download for Quicken 2011 for the Dell, we converted the files, and were uploaded to the Mac.  (Fortunately it was my computer savvy son who was dealing with all of this, not me.)<br />Now I am working relatively well with the Mac version, I use it for my check register and make reports for tax categories like charitable giving.  Pretty smooth."
1,We use Quicken in our business and find that it helps our smaller clients give us organized information from which to prepare their tax returns.
0,"After all the controversy I was disgusted with Turbo Tax. It's just okay. What I dislike is that after you input something, the screen goes back to the top instead of where you were working. I've lost faith in Turbo Tax, and will check out other programs for next year."
1,"I have tried a few antivirus programs in my time.  Quite a few.  Something always manages to slip in.  Not with Avast!  It sees it and handles it.  No fuss, no muss."
0,"Crashed. Did NOT do the job the other product Quicken Essentials SHOULD have done.<br />Penalized because we use a Mac - the support guy had to say &#34;Well, if you get a PC, the PC version does what you need. I threw it OFF by hard drive and will never try to use Intuit for a Mac solution."
0,"I'm another ex loyal customer of Turbotax who almost got burned.  Thanks to those who gave the one star rating.  I wasn't even going to look at the ratings since TT has always been good--the software version that is, not the online, that was a headache a few years ago--never again.  Just as I was about to click the buy button I noticed the low star rating and decided to read some of the reviews--glad I did.  I need the schedule D and with broker data import.<br />  I think what really frosts people is not the fact that the price went up--it's the sneaky way that unsuspecting buyers were duped into buying what they thought was their normal product and then they were forced to cough up another 30 bucks or lose their entire investment.  This is no way to do business and it will lose a lot of customers--including me.  Had they merely increased the cost by ten bucks nobody would have cared--most everything goes up a little..<br />  I just downloaded the less expensive H & R Block  program and did a preliminary mockup of my 2014 return in minutes---very smooth, didn't have to read any directions. It didn't install any other unwanted programs.  It imported by 2013 Turbotax information perfectly--I didn't even have to tell it where to fiind it.  It seemed very easy to pick and choose what sections to fill out and which to skip.  I like it.  Saved me $50 too--that I really like."

0,"Found this lacking in content. Definitely not on par with Rosetta Stone, but unfortunately Rosetta Stone only has Hindi and not Gujarati. Still looking for something better and not overly expensive."
0,I upgraded to 2014 from 2013.  I pretty well stay current.  So far the only real improvement I can see is after updating my finances I don't have to click to look and see what was downloaded and then close the window for each account.  They are all shown on same page.  This was a good update but such a no brainer it should have been that way all the time.  Just in case someone from Quicken ever reads this I will ask again.  When doing Find from register by select field and then right clicking I much preferred when that field's name was the default in Quicken Find window.  It once was that way but disappeared so long ago I don't remember which version took it away.
0,Bugged! They had work arounds for the bug that wouldn't allow the program to work/data transfer from old to new. Tried all the work arounds and it still didn't work. So went back to 2012 version until they fix the bug.
0,"It was a disappointment.  Doesn't provide some of the features that I would really love -- like ability to highlight line items, etc.  Maybe the product I want doesn't exist.  This product seems to be declining in quality and being user-friendly -- have been using quicken for over 10 years.  Would like a better product."
1,Finally a version of Quicken for the Mac. Doesn't do all I'd like but works well enough for my needs. Hopefully the promised improvements will materialize in due time and without additional extra costs.
1,"I installed this on my daughter's older computer and have had great results, highly recommend. It was so easy to install , easy to use and tells me when updates are needed."
1,Packed with everything that I need.  Have used Word Perfect for many years and prefer it over anything on the market.
1,"What can I say ... it's easy easy easy to use. I'm a do-it-your-selfer, and this fit the bill. Easy to use ... walks you through everything and even suggests deductions you may not have thought of (unless you're an accountant).<br /><br />Fast to fill it out and files electronically for you, then electronically delivers the refund $$$ into your bank account.<br /><br />&#60;3 it!"
1,This software provides great assistance and advice on how to report your taxes.
0,"The program was easy to use but I was a bit disappointed that it charged my credit card $24.99 to E-file, and then it<br />told me that I cannot E-file because a return with the same SSN had already been filed. It would have been nice<br />to learn that before my credit card was charged."
0,"I follow a practice of upgrading Quicken every two years.  I don't know why, but usually, after 2 years, I get worried about tax planning, and long for a new look.  Since you can't monkey with the tax planning parameters to put in known rates, etc, I decided to upgrade to 2012.<br /><br />The obvious UI changes were .... obvious.  Not better, mind you, but you knew it wasn't the 2010 version I had been using.<br /><br />As others wrote, the first One Step Update hung.  Didn't happen again, so, OK.<br /><br />Can't remember all of the little things that I wrestled with.  Probably because I'm so flummoxed by the budget process.  It's beyond me how this was a design target.  I was very comfortable with the calendar-year budget that let you quickly view a Summary, by month.  I relied exclusively on this to tell me what was left after all Income and Expenses.  Now, I can't for the life of me find a summary like I had.  The view of Budgets only lets you see the current and past months!  You can't view a future month in the Budget view!<br /><br />Also, the Budget report doesn't sort Category groups as it always has.  The random order is confusing.  Plus, one of my category groups for which I definitely have budgeted funds, doesn't display in the report.  And, yes, I selected \\""All Actual/Non-Zero Budgeted categories\\"".<br /><br />Anyway, I requested a refund and I'm going to look for a 2011 copy somewhere.  I lost a couple of weeks of transactions in the new 2012 format, which I assume are in the bit bucket now.  I'm sure I'll recover...."
1,Worked just fine.  Really went into detail...a bit more than I needed but it got the job done.
1,"Being a new business owner I needed a program that was accessible everywhere, Home and on the go.  With QuickBooks I have that and I can invite my accountant to get in there and fix things or tell me what I need to change"
1,Avast has stopped several malware issues on my PC before they wiped it out.<br />Easy to use interface is super cool for hard core users to beginners.
1,"This PC virus protection costs much less than renewing McAfee virus protection directly from The McAfee website, and it covers 3 PCs! I had read that it was difficult to install, but I have Windows 8 on one PC and Windows 7 on another, and I had no problems uninstalling the old McAfee software and installing 2015 Total Protection on either machine. Great value."
1,I have been using Turbo Tax for years and Love IT!!  I have tried others but just go back to Turbo Tax!
1,Great for musicians tha don't have other players to work with !
0,This program was a waste of my money. Doesn't give you the option of creating your own items and you can't edit the premade ones. If you have no imagination then this would be great but I won't be using it again.
0,"They ruined it. I have been a user of Visio since 1998 and have always loved it, until now.<br />2013 should not be called visio."
1,Very easy to use.
0,I admit my review may not agree with those who are more experienced than I at using this type of software but I can't see me spending the time it would take as a new user to actually learn and use this stuff. There has to be software out there that it doesn't take a degree to use.
1,would recommend to anybody it was very easy to follow a good product
1,"I gave it a five star rating because the program was clear, concise, user friendly and glitch fee... would use it again in a heartbeat!!"
0,"I have been a loyal quicken user since 1997, and always considered it to be one of the most dependable pieces of software out there until this version.<br /><br />For the first time I have had to call customer support and now have spent HOURS hours on the phone. I don't even know where to begin on listing the problems as they are NUMEROUS!. The most serious of all is ultimately data corruption.<br /><br />I have now been forced to revert to a one month old backup. The loss of data for me is catastrophic! Estimates, customer invoicing, job costing, ARGH! It is going to take me days upon days to regenerate all of these transactions if I even can.<br /><br />Intuit is telling me it is my fault as I stored my data on my \\""D\\"" drive instead of my \\""C\\"" drive where the program is installed. I will just say this . . . Since 1997 I have maintained my data in this matter without any corruption at all. If the program is so sensitive to where the data is stored, why are there not any warnings whatsoever upon installation of this product. No were does it say \\""this program must be installed on your \\""C\\"" drive and so must your data or else your world will come crashing down upon you\\"" (as mine has).<br /><br />I would revert to my 2012 version if I could, but for the first time Quicken is no longer backward compatible. I almost feel like they knew they were releasing garbage and made it so there is no way out but to endure what is clearly a piece of beta software.<br /><br />Additionally the support team is foreign. Now I feel bad saying this as they do try hard, and try to be nice, but there is a language barrier that is just unacceptable. It adds tremendous frustration to an already frustrating situation. I am sorry, but I do want to speak to an american, and do not call be a racist because I am far from it!<br /><br />When I talk to Quicken they offer no apologies, deny the product has problems, and left me with a ONE MONTH HOLE IN MY DATA. They simply said \\""you are entitled to a refund if you purchased this less than 90 days ago. Considering that I have owned just about every version they have made since 1997 I feel I (was) a customer who deserved a little better. How about offering a more stable product, shoot give me Quickbooks until this monstrosity is usable again.<br /><br />I do want to qualify my opinion as I am not the standard user. I am a construction cost manager who has used just about every accounting program out there. I run a small painting company on the side as a sole proprietor and this software is just not acceptable for any form of business activities.<br /><br />It is too late for a refund, I do not trust intuit any more and I am now looking for a different product.<br /><br />This issue has made the news, and I only wish I had read this BEFORE I purchased this version:<br /><br />[...]"

1,"I have been a PaperPort customer for around 10 years now and I had learned to love the product.  But after Nuance took over, I wasn't as pleased.  The older PaperPort still works and I use it but I needed something that I could upgrade without causing me headaches so I tried out FileCenter 7 then upgraded to the beta of 8 recently.  I was amazed.<br /><br />FileCenter offers a much more navigable interface than PaperPort and nearly all the features (if you go with Pro, you DO get all the features).  Certainly, it offers all the features I need.  It automatically makes the documents you scan searchable and it's much easier to find the features you want to use than in the competition.  And it happens to be a current product that is compatible with current versions of Windows.<br /><br />I found is so much easier to use than PaperPort and with the price of the \\""Standard\\"" edition of only $49.95, it was no contest.  If you want a scanned document manager that doesn't leave you with your eyes crossed and your pockets empty, I highly recommend FileCenter (either 7 or 8 - they're both great)!"
0,"Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing but I've used the deluxe version for years without issue so why should I expect problems? I have a small business and never had any problems with completing Schedule C in the past. But now it seems Sch C is limited in the deluxe version to businesses with less than $100 in expenses so its useless if you have a real business. Now it looks like I'll have to upgrade to home and business if I want to use TT this year. Or maybe now's the time to abandon TT for something else. Way to support your long-term customer base Intuit!    Update:  Ended up going with the H&R Deluxe. Cheaper, easy import of old TT file and easy transition. A little clunckier when it comes to printing/saving files but end product is the same. Intuit got my $ this year but no more. I'm done with TT, Quicken, and QuickBooks."

0,"After a day's worth of playing around with this program, I regret having spent the $80 for the upgrade.  I was really excited about the mobile application and sync.  It works great as long as you want to duplicate all of your transactions.  Well, that is if you can get the sync to work at all.  The program either gives a \\""getModifiedTransactions\\"" error or locks up completely requiring a force close.  The look, feel, and functions of the core program really do not appear to be much different than the 2011 version.  I do like the year view on the budget, but it seems to be too much squished into one screen...and I have a 27 in monitor.  Sad."

I like that Adobe upgrades every now and then.<br /><br />It handles RAW files very well from my D7100 of an average of 27MB per file. A lot to learn about this if you are new to Lightroom, but if you're tech savvy, you should be good."
1,I have been a Norton fan for years. Always gets the job done. I would recommend this to anyone with a pc.
0,Maybe I loaded it wrong or something but it is extremely slow and keeps freezing up
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax deluxe for about 10 years, but it just kept getting more and more expensive.  I finally decided to switch because this was much less expensive and promised to be able to import my prior year Turbo Tax return.  It did, and it did it so easily and perfectly that I'll use this again next year.  Not only that, but this was much easier to do my state (PA) taxes than with Turbo Tax."
0,A  pure waste of my time downloading.  Glad I didn't waste my money as well.  Skip it.
1,"Easy to download, no waiting on disc. Have not had any problems with other programs while using it. Does slow computer a bit."
1,"This program consistently rates as among the best of the antivirus programs by independent testing organizations, and it is free! The advertising is not too obtrusive and it updates the definitions automatically, although the user must participate in program updates. All in all, a good program to have to protect your computer from attack, along with the Windows firewall, and antispam mail applications."
1,"I like the way Turbo ta brings in your info from last year and then goes step by step trough all the incomes and then the deductions,<br /><br />My disappointment was I paid for the State ($19.95) return of my Mom's tax info.  Then it was rejected as the name of one entity was &#34;too long to accept&#34; and I then had to mail it in,  Then when I sent an email to Turbo tax, they did not answer,"
0,"WOW!  They wanted another $110 to actually download publisher when it was supposed to be included in the office software.  What a joke!!!<br />Amazon should not carry this product!!  I have always been a big customer of Amazon, but this makes me reconsider."
1,I love the new features it is so much easier to work with.
0,"If I wasn't more or less forced to buy this 2013 edition, I would have stayed with the 2010 Edition.  The 2010 was  more user friendly.  I liked where I could reconcile myself."
0,worst.
1,"EXCELLENT PROGRAM, EASY TO WORK WITH."
1,"Seriously professional grade free antivirus. I haven't had any issues with viruses since installing this software. As good as it gets. Only minor annoyance are frequent reminders to upgrade to pay versions. Can't blame them for wanting us to upgrade to pay version, but I don't see the necessity with as good as free version is. Highly recommended."
1,Have never been disappointed with Amazon or TurboTax. Feel safe using Amazon for any purchase. TurboTax is very user friendly.
1,"I purchased this for my wife when her old version had glitches and wouldn't re-install on our Windows 7 computer. She said that the tech messed up when it came to coding the auto preserve as you cannot find it unless you 'unhide&#34; programs that are meant to be hidden so you don't accidentally delete them. That issue aside, she loves the flexibility of the program"
1,"So far I'm really impressed with LR6; the GPU enhancement alone makes it worth the upgrade to me. I do all my heavy lifting (i.e. pixel-level editing) in Photoshop, so my needs are centered more on performance and efficiency than new features. I primary use LR as a database management tool and basic developer, and still I’d say the upgrade is worth the cost. For those that do most or all of their editing in LR, this upgrade is huge.<br /><br />Adobe continues to blur the line between LR and PS by adding more localized adjustments (filter brushes) in LR with this release. It’s great news for those that don’t want to bother with PS. I admit it’ll even help speed up my workflow for simple vacation or family pics when I’m not going to spend a lot of time editing. They also continue to reduce the needs for external editors, with the addition of HDR and Pano stitching, both of which allows you to keep the file is a mostly non-destructive format, in-line with the workflow of LR. I haven’t had a chance yet to test out realistic HDR composites for architectural/real estate photography, but presuming that works, between HDR and the perspective correction they added in LR5, they just sped up the workflow for a whole lot of RE photographers. Now if they can just add a more powerful noise reduction engine, I won’t have need for any third-party plugins.<br /><br />I have no interest in face recognition or mobile platforms, but everyone is different and I’m sure someone will appreciate it. They’re obviously expanding their market to apply to a wider range, including the Facebook/Instagram generation. I don’t really do the slideshow thing, but now there’s control over audio tracks and panning and whatnot."
1,"I can't praise this product enough. The seller shipped fast and it arrived in perfect shape. As for the the product, this is the ultimate paint and drawing program and makes an excellent companion to photoshop or just to your digital artist tools. It does have a tendency to crash, but that may be my video card and the program arguing with each other."
1,It's got what I need and is easy to download and to use. It's the foundation of my word processing and accounting tools.
0,"Not adding much that hasn't been said above. Just a bit about my experience:<br /><br />When I started with Amazon Cloud, they had an app that let you keep a folder on your computer up to date with your Amazon Cloud storage. Simple and easy. Works on a Mac, works on Windows, even works on things like tablets. That's just like Dropbox, Google and several others. I rumbled along not paying a lot of attention to changes. Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.<br /><br />Is there a gotcha with the &#34;sync&#34; approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.<br /><br />Any bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the &#34;Unlimited Everything&#34; plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage? Unless they come up with a sync solution, I would avoid using their service. It's just not as useful as some of the others.<br /><br />Why *would* I use their service? About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys. They might hit the backups as well as your main disk. It might work when the whole town and every computer in it goes under water."
1,Amazing antivirus
1,best anti-virus I've ever used including ones I've had to pay for. All my friends even the ones who do IT work on computers recommend this program. It has found all the viruses and spy ware on my computers regardless of Operating System. I also use it to protect my mobile devices.
0,"Just been trying to make a screensaver which all I get is not an EXE installable screensaver ,so I can't install it ,but preview is ok just can't install it"
1,"I'm sorry for this users problems.  But I've used the desktop version for a long time.  Elegant, accurate, easy to use."
0,The reason for the negative rating is because it does not work on my Kindle Fire HD.
1,great price
0,"If you just use Word, Excel, and Power Point, you will probably find the programs easy to work with if you're familiar with the older versions. Changes to placement of common work functions seem arbitrary and you must relearn where those commands are located which can slow down your work until you've become accustomed to them. I've had the worst experience using Outlook which comes up with errors and crashes constantly. I've had to create new identities a number of times just to be able to access Outlook after crashes and I'm still having problems. I am very surprised by my experience with Outlook as I have been using Outlook at work with Microsoft operating system for years but this version I don't recommend using."
0,"Download the program. It will allegedly identify many problems on your computer, then ask you to pay to register for the program to actually FIX the problems. No...this is NOT free and is false advertising. Avoid this program. A program advertised as free should be free. No the program did not allow free use for ANY time period after the alleged computer scan."
1,"Just finished downloading the product - no problems at all.  Smoothly downloaded from Amazon (after about an hour \\""security\\"" wait) in about 30 minutes.  Installed in 5 minutes and I was good to go.  Used IntExp rather than Chrome just to be sure.  All good!!"
0,"I was very excited to get this product.  I am a first time user but fairly computer savvy and did not expect issues.  However, I had trouble downloading my accounts and can find no way to add my HSA account.  It is through my main bank, but separate.  I haven't even tried the mobile app yet and can't get things where I want them.  Will keep trying, but beware if you are new to this product."
1,Of course it works great.  The only thing is that Quicken does not recognize my email ID or password used through the years.  That puzzles me.  I've usually downloaded their updates directly from Quicken so maybe using Amazon changed this?  I did like getting things at a lower expense.
0,Very cumbersome to use for editing. I ended up buying another software that was much easier to use.
0,"If you want to file a corporate return with Turbo Tax, you must use a Windows machine. I tried. I fired up an old Windows machine and installed it, gave it a whirl. The software is clumsy and outdated. I seriously hope Turbo Tax will offer corporate tax return software for Mac or even a web version. Why they cannot baffles me. Many customers are fleeing to competitors due to this. TaxAct offers a web version of their corporate tax return software, which plays nice with Mac or Chromebook or whatever. I've &#34;kicked the tires&#34; on it and so far I like it better than Turbo Tax, and it is much cheaper too. I don't want to the cheapest tax prep software, I want the best and easiest to use. Right now, Turbo Tax is lagging. It's 2015 and Intuit cannot offer this software for Mac or via the web? Is there some reason for this?"
1,"This system is flexible, and allows complete automation or not.  It will tell you if other applications have updates as well.  The paid version includes lots of other functions I didn't try.  I've had no problems with the program or with my system.  I also use other programs as well to keep my system running smoothly."
0,"I am a MS Money and Quicken user for the last 13+ years. I purchased a new Mac and discovered that I can no longer use regular Quicken, so I read several reviews and finally chose this app due to the high praise and &#34;ease&#34; of use this received.  I wish I had gotten the 30 day trial of this before purchasing the software, because I never would have spent this money. I am going to try the Quicken essentials, since that is supported by most  banks -- iBank is not.  If you want to try this, I urge you to get the 30-day trial first."
0,"Don't like the annoying popups for updates.<br />Otherwise it appears to get the job done.<br />Another thing, I hate rating it."
1,ok
1,"...and I've used most of them since version 3. Still powerful,and fewer annoyances than Photoshop Elements 10.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements (PSE) 11 --like its earlier versions-- is an image editor with enough features to rapidly surpass the skills (and time available to explore!) of even highly skilled amateur photographers. The overall interface will be familiar to user of PSE versions as far back as PSE 6 or 7. PSE 11 incorporates most of the multiple image merge functions familiar to users since PSE 7. As with previous versions, PSE 11 offers this for a fraction of the cost of its big-brother Photoshop CS6. Most amateur photographers --and maybe even some \\""thrifty\\"" professionals-- can perform all but the most advanced digital editing with PSE 11.<br /><br />Note: This review assumes some familiarity with digital photography and digital image concepts.<br /><br />Installation:<br />-No issues with installation. I tested it on two desktops and a laptop (variously running Windows 7 and Windows 8.. ):<br />-32-bit dual-core 3 GHZ processor, 4 GB of RAM.<br />-64-bit quad-core 3.4 GHZ processor, 16 GB of RAM.<br />-64 but dual-core 1.3 GHZ mobile processor, 4 GB of RAM<br /><br />-I installed PSE 11 on one machine already running PSE 10. Unlike earlier versions, PSE 11 does not require users to decide whether to continue using the earlier version or use the new version exclusively. You have the option to use both version 11 and version 10...and I was able to run them both at the same time.<br /><br />-The license for this product permits installation on one primary and one \\""mobile\\"" computer, with the restriction not to use on both computers at the same time.<br /><br />-Total installation time after downloading (including entering the registration code and skimming the EULA) was about 15 minutes on each of the machines described above). This was followed by PSE 11's \\""Organizer\\"" component performing its own indexing of the digital images on the computer. Cataloging over 56,000 digital images took about 35 minutes. Obviously hardware and the volume of images to index will mean variable times for each user...but the indexing was very fast. If you're a Windows user and store your images in a non-default \\""My Pictures\\"" location under your user name, you'll have to tell PSE where to browse for this indexing. The catalog has multiple sorting options. The chronological sort (based on image file .exif data) is completed automatically during indexing. Three other options (people, place and events) require interaction with the user interface to complete some or all of those sort capabilities.<br /><br />Function and features:<br />-The interface, function and features of PSE 11 will be familiar to users of recent PSE versions. Overall it's cleaner and slightly simplified since version 10. The .psd files are still manipulated using layers and selection tools. The complete range of image effects (\\""filters\\""), image enhancement and editing tools are essentially unchanged since version 6. Still present are options to open, edit and save in wide range of file formats.<br /><br />-Output to the printers on my system was trouble-free. Accepting the default printing options yielded fine results, but advanced options for those who like to tweak are readily available. PSE 11 successfully offered options to print to the two physical (laserjet, inkjet) and two virtual (Acrobat and Microsoft Document Writer) printers attached to my desktop.<br /><br />Issues:<br />-PSE 11 and Adobe continue to assume plenty about user connectivity. All of the help files for PSE 11 are online. Select \\""Help\\"" in the menu bar (or press the \\""F1\\"" key), and you are not taken to local help files...you are taken to adobe.com. This is fine if you are connected to the Internet, but less fine if you are not (and some people are NOT connected at all times). You can optionally download a 9 MB .pdf user guide. This is an option you'll want to exercise if you anticipate needing help while not online or if you have bandwidth constraints where you work.<br /><br />It did not recognize a multi-function device (printer/scanner/copier) connected via Ethernet for creating new files directly from the scanner.<br /><br />Finally:<br />-PSE 11, like all of its predecessors is feature dense. Even power users of earlier versions will benefit from additional help. In addition to widely available online forums (hosted by Adobe and elsewhere on the web; search popular video sites for step-by-steps on even the most advanced functions), a reference book will improve your user experience. Remember: technology is complicated, and you're not a dummy! Rather than something in yellow and black that calls you names, consider the PSE 11 edition of the [[ASIN:1449316131 \\""Missing Manual\\""]] series (also available in a [[ASIN:B009GRX2JE Kindle edition]]).<br /><br />PSE 11 is a powerful image editing tool priced right for consumers. Purchase with confidence, IF you're using version 10, you probably won;t find an upgrade worthwhile, but consider if you don't have a good image editor or PSE version 9 or earlier.<br /><br />I found version 10 to be rather aggressive in encouraging users to participate in its online service (via registration and creation of an \\""Adobe Online ID\\"". This pressure is happily absent from PSE 11, and is one \\""feature\\"" I don't miss.<br /><br />Select with confidence!hile not online or if you have bandwidth constraints where you work.<br /><br />It did not recognize a multi-function device (printer/scanner/copier) connected via Ethernet for creating new files directly from the scanner.<br /><br />Finally:<br />-PSE 11, like all of its predecessors is feature dense.

1,SEEMS TO WORK.
0,"The new plan sucks, but even more than that, the new software isn't as useful or intuitive as older versions.<br /><br />I used Ai CS6 on a work computer for many years.  After I changed jobs, I wanted to see about buying the software for myself and tried the new subscription plan.  Ugh!  Not only is it WAY more expensive, I can't even figure out how to make the software do the simple things that used to be effortless in Ai CS6!  There are controls missing, or moved, that I can't work without and it has extra stuff I just don't need.  Expensive AND not as good does not equal a good business plan.  Sorry, Adobe."
0,"OK, I removed it."
0,"It works ok, however, there appears to be no way to just turn it off so I can just run the scans whenever I choose.  I'm getting really tired of apps running in the background.  When will these companies learn that some of us just don't want that crap?  At least it was cheap."
0,"I'm joining the queue to urge new purchasers to use caution with this edition.<br /><br />I've been a user since Quicken 6, back around 1993, I believe.  I updated from Quicken 2010, seduced by the promise of the mobile app.  It isn't ready.  And, it's a Cloud application.<br /><br />I purchased the edition last week, starting at R1.  We're now at R4.  I have three bank account balances.  Looks like only cleared online balances are transferred, not what you might have on the desktop for a user balance.  And, I had continuing problems about credit account balances not matching between device and desktop, so I dumped those after several tries.<br /><br />Although I can't verify at the moment, I SEE SOME USERS REPORT DELETION AND DUPLICATION OF TRANSACTIONS.  Even after the R4 'fix.'<br /><br />Creating, revising, or deleting the cloud info isn't easy.  In fact, instructions don't seem to match up with reality.  The only deletion of the cloud I have (maybe) gotten is after approving an overwrite from the desktop.  Not a freestanding deletion as suggested on Intuit help!<br /><br />In sum, welcome to Beta land!"
1,Good deal for the price. Previously had mcafee but decided to switch over.
1,"For my needs, this software does the job. It's a much better deal than Turbotax, which would not have saved me any more money. The only issue I have with it is once it's been downloaded, instructions aren't real clear on how to open it. Didn't take long, though. Still would recommend it. I've been using H and R for several years."
1,"Can't say enough good things about TurboTax.  This was our first experience with the Home and Business version, and it's just as easy as the &#34;standard&#34; one.  Well worth it."
1,Avast has stopped virus's from infecting my computer. It keeps me advised of threats and updates automatically. I feel safe with avast.
0,"The product is worthless unless you upgrade to OSX 10.7 or higher.  My older (but still perfectly functional) MacBook Pro cannot be upgraded beyond 10.6.  Thus, the latest version of TurboTax does not work on it.  This is a completely unacceptable approach by Intuit."
1,"Good overall but tried using Form 1116 for foreign tax payment on dividends. It required manual entry and did not work for me. Also had problem with allocation of property taxes across home office, rental and main residence<br />Fortunately the online email person was very helpful"
0,I purchased this and spent hours trying to get it to work and more than an hour with Tech Support they told me to send it back for a refund..it does not work with Kindle Fire HD...not sure of any other places it does not work at.
1,"I have PS6, but also wanted a (backup program). I use Capture One 7 Express for RAW conversion, CS6 for end editing, now also PSP X6 Ultimate (quick editing through a lot of images) and as a back up end editing program (even though I am an amteur, I want things that work).<br /><br />PSP X6 ULTIMATE version has a great interface, is basically very similar functionally to CS6, has layers, levels, curves just as CS6, and comes with a couple of free useful addins (Perfectly Clear works well for those times you really want to rush out something or just don't want to spend the time on edits).<br /><br />FOR ME, NIK plugins work as follows:<br /><br />Nik Color Efex 4 and Silver Efex 4, via a plugin script that can be found at Corel forums,do a google search and a guy has posted the script. Nik Sharpener and Dfine, via normal plugin drop down and one installs a direct copy of the executable file in the Corel PSP X6 plugin folder under USERS/ COREL/ PSP/ 16.<br /><br />A very good editing program and for the price, a bargain. I actually bought mine direct from Corel, as I live outside US could not buy for the additional savings that Amazon provides here. But it was still worth it. For the Amazon price, it is simply cheap for a very good product."
1,everything ok!!<br />very good product and very strong protection that this software provides!<br />the download speed was very fast !
1,"It worked.... too expensive I think, why is not offered bundled with state?"
0,"I am writing this specifically about DOWNLOADED AutoCAD from Autodesk.  I'm an independent consultant.  I bought the previous version of LT from Autodesk, downloaded it on my laptop, used it for a few months and then my laptop was stolen.  After getting a new computer I made several efforts to contact Autodesk and reinstall AutoCAD on my new laptop.  It was nearly impossible to get someone to speak with me.  If you're a small business or individual assume that you will never (ever) speak to Autodesk without paying for it through some sort of support agreement.  When I finally did get someone to &#34;help&#34; me she provided me with a link to download AutoCAD, which turned out to download the trial version, and would require me to pay the entire value again.  Now I need AutoCAD for another project and here I am having to buy it.  Again.  My advice is to ALWAYS BUT AUTOCAD IN A BOX.  You cannot trust this company to help you if you don't by dozens of licenses at a time.  It’s worth the extra $250.00 or whatever is &#34;fair&#34; for a box and a CD."

0,"I am a long time user of Visio, having used it to do many process models, class diagrams, activity diagrams, use case models, etc. over the years. The tool used to be good. This version has destroyed the product. The tool used to be considerably more user friendly then it is now. One of the biggest problems I have run into is trying to attach various lines (e.g. sequence flows, message flows) where I want to attach them. This used to be very simple and straightforward. This new version of Visio has &#34;fixed&#34; that by making it almost impossible. My time to create a process model has now doubled. A relatively simple change, that took about 30 minutes, now takes upward of an hour, with half that time trying to get the lines to hook up the way they need to be hooked up.<br /><br />I have actually asked my helpdesk to rollback to the previous version. This product does not even rate a full star."
1,great price and quick delivery
1,Been a user for many years. It great.
1,"Fortunately, I have access to these programs, but was attracted by the price to consider an additional license.  On the list it says &quot;12-month plan $9.99,&quot; which changes to &quot;$9.99 per month,&quot; which really means &quot;12-month plan $119.84.&quot;  I realize that Microsoft also uses a 12-month subscription model, but this seems to be a bait and switch.<br />Hopefully, this is an error that Adobe will correct - but this is what the product listing looked like on 7-22-15<br />Having achieved some degree of familiarity with these complex programs, I would caution beginners not to expect to know if this program meets their needs within one month."
1,Great program to have on your mac. It's for .rar files and such.
1,"An incredible value as software, for what comes 'in the box'  at its $14.00 price.  It's a very powerful system for animating or just drawing.  Once you get the hang of it, animating is fun and I can't imagine can be made much easier.  Some people apparently want to be able to make a cartoon in five or six clicks of a mouse - although it is a probably as close as you can come to it!  This software is designed as an intro to creating powerful custom animation.<br /><br />No powerful software comes without a steep learning curve.  It does have a 'beginners' mode.'  If you want to buy this software and use it be prepared to spend a lot of time and then you will find its value.<br /><br /> But:<br />Their support system stinks.  Even after registering they won't give me the debugged upgrade to 10.3(or whatever it is and still be 10) - When I click update in their menu they give me window saying...&#34;BUY version 11! - only ----- dollars.&#34;  That's bizarre - I've never seen a company make just an upgrade of a current version so difficult.  Most companies WANT you to have the best possible version of what you paid for.  Just getting signed into their support boards and registering the software was huge hassle.<br /><br />Help is limited to online support boards which only have answers to complex esoteric things and are not designed for people starting.<br /> Usually you can look on the internet for support for common software, especially games, but this is too esoteric to find little things.  You can find videos on it on YouTube.<br /><br />So the company that makes/sells this, Smith Micro... leave a lot to be desired in support.  But the software itself is excellent, once you figure out how to use it."
1,Sped up my computer instantly. Caused no problems and was significantly lower in price than local stores. Would definitely reccommend.

1,"I installed Photoshop Elements 9 on my 2.8 GHz i7 iMac, running System 10.6.7. Since many reviewers of the boxed version have thoroughly discussed the features of the application already, I am focusing this review on my experience of using Photoshop Elements in conjunction with Apple iPhoto.<br /><br />Background<br />*My main camera is a 6-year old \\""prosumer\\"" Nikon. Back when my camera was new, digital SLR's were primarily targeted to professionals and compact digital cameras had extremely limited functionality. Even though prosumer cameras aren't a significant presence in today's digital camera market, these cameras still produce better images than most current compacts due to their relatively large image sensors.<br />*I also have a collection of images that were scanned from 35mm film prints. Many of these pix have faded colors as well as digital artifacts from the scanning process.<br /><br />My review perspective<br />*I use iPhoto as my main photo repository and for simple tasks such as cropping, straightening, and basic exposure adjustments. I want to use Photoshop Elements to do things that are beyond iPhoto's capabilities, including correcting lens distortion on wide-angle shots, cleaning up and enhancing scanned photos, and making extensive alterations to images (such as removing an unwanted bystander from an architectural shot or blurring a distracting background).<br /><br />User experience<br />*Photoshop Elements is a feature-laden and complex application.

1,Love Turbo Tax and love the company Intuit - very good people making a very good product. Next year I will go back to the retail version though as I didn't love the whole download thing.
0,I've spent countless hours trying to get this to work over the last nine months.  I think they released it with zero testing so that the customers could do the testing. A nightmare.
1,We have use Quicken since it came out. We like it better than other. I wouldn't change to another brand.
1,"Overall, TurboTax was effective, but it had a few problems.  One: when doing a multi-state filing, it failed to advise me to complete the info for the non-resident state first, which caused me to later haveto redo all three states info to get them coordinated.  I only found this out on my own when the taxes for the 3 states didn't look right... TurboTax never did alert me to the problem.  Then, when filing, I took the option of filing the FED return first, planning to do the AR state return the next day, only to find out too late that AR cannot be efiled if not filed at the same time as the FED return.  So I had to mail it in."
1,"This was easy to download onto my MacBook Pro. I loved it.  Microsoft word, excel, and powerpoint works great on my Mac"
1,"Been using Quicken for over 15 years, Excellent product for budgeting and monitoring finances. I would definitely recommend this program,"
0,Two issues; the interface is not as nice as previous years. Second issue is that I was never able to download the state return even though it is supposed to be included in the price. Nothing on the Intuit web site was a help and they never answered my email. I'll probably end up buying it again next year so that I don't have to type in everything from scratch. But the Intuit quality was disappointing this year for sure.
1,The product has worked great. I have seen improvement with my music comprehension because of this program
0,i was able to use product. however it did do what it promised. again i do not appresiate having to type more words based on your requirements.
1,"Had some minor issues upfront. But since the newest release we have been trouble free. I have to say while the first level of customer care leaves alot to be desired I was able to get some great assistance from &#34;senior service and support specialist&#34;<br /><br />Mobile app leaves a little to be desired ie you can input a manual transaction on the mobile app but cannot do split categories. You can however do split categories on downloaded transactions from the bank on the mobile app... But I don't use that. Also you can only view/track/use cash and bank accounts in the mobile app. So you can't view your investments, asset or loan accounts. I think it is a good start and I hope they listen to us and provide more on the mobile app. FYI been using quicken since 92 or 93."
0,This is the software for you if you like being stuck in a box with the only way out being to spend more of your hard earned cash.  This version has a collection of canned templates that it isn't possible to modify in any way without spending another $85.  I read several reviews on this before I started and am very upset that there was no mention of having to spend more money to get functionality that should be included in the base software.<br /><br />The only good news is I am out $20 but will never purchase another thing from this sleazy company
1,"I've used avast free on one of my computers for about 5yrs  and not one problem !<br />and another free one on another computer for the same tome , that thinks every thing is a problem .<br />I still use both but Avast has never let me get a virus, same with the \\""other one\\"" but that one<br />keeps me looking up crap all the time to make sure it's safe .<br />( you will know what I'm talking about when you try the others)<br />Thanks Avast ."
1,"I use this with a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium, and it's an amazing setup for doing digital art.<br />There are tons of built in brushes, with support for custom brushes. There is support for pressure sensitivity as well.  You can save to several formats, one of which is made to exporting to photoshop or programs that can use photoshop psd files. This makes it easy to take your work into another program for other effects or finishing touches.<br /><br />Note that this program is not made for photo editing, but for digital art.  You can edit photos in it if you want, but there are better programs for that."
1,"I've used H$R Block tax program for about 10 years, this is the first time I did the download. I have a 5 yr old PC (Vista operating system) and the program downloaded prefectly - a little slow but that's what you get from a 5 yr old PC (after owning an Ipad I'll get a MAC the next time around - but that's another review). The program grabbed the info off of my last years return and walked me thru the process asking me all the right questions to complete and free e-file my federal return. I downloaded a free state return (NE) and next year I won't have to since I am now a SD resident and they kind of like their citizens - NO STATE INCOME TAX!!! :).  I usually pay the $19.99 to e-file my state return too but because I was only a partial NE resident I had to use USPS - I'll save that next year too (sorry don't mean to gloat) .<br />I use Block instead of TurboTax just based on the price difference (TT is more expensive) - so I have zero experience w/TT."
1,This program I use now and then. Especially the Word program.<br />So far it's been okay to use. Good Program
0,"Download size: 23.95MB Price $50, what's wrong here with all these converters.  They are all in a horse race or something price fixing junk.  I want some code written and some time spent, not on the box and marketing, but the software.  Never spend that kind of money on a program the size of a digital postage stamp."
0,A piece of trash. it caused my computer to run very slow and kept asking me to buy a fix for a slow running computer. When I uninstalled it my computer returned to normal and ran fast again. What a scam.
0,Very limited options available.  Not what I was expecting since I have used other similar programs.  I expected more for my money.
1,"Good Internet Security,"
1,Works great and was very easy to download and activate
0,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for over 15 years.  The last 12, maybe, I've been using TurboTax online (not the desktop version).  As far as I can tell, the &#34;offer&#34; to upgrade for free from the Deluxe version, AND the rebate for the requirement to upgrade, is ONLY valid on the &#34;Desktop&#34; version.  I just logged into my account, and the upgrade from Deluxe, to get the schedules I had under Deluxe last year, will cost me $24.99 extra.  (Yes, it's post Feb 7th).<br /><br />I did call the customer service number, but after holding 20 minutes, called the alternate number where I was told they'd call me back - no hold option.  They also said they'd make ONE attempt - and didn't advise the timeframe, so I'm apparently glued to the phone to double check this.<br /><br />I'll give them 12 hours, in the hope that maybe they'll upgrade the online version as well.  If not  . . . . off to H&R Block for me."
0,"This product behaves much like the viruses that it's supposed to protect you from.  Every day since I installed it, I get a popup on my computer prompting me to install the Norton Toolbar.  I don't want to install the Norton Toolbar.  But if I don't, then apparently I'll continue to see the popup again & again.  I can't believe that an anti-virus product would mimic the viruses that it's supposed to be protecting you from, with such intrusive unwanted behavior.  There is no way to disable this popup unless you allow the software to strong-arm you into infecting your browser with its own add-on.<br /><br />Poor form, Norton.  I've been a Norton user for more than 10 years, but I won't be renewing again."
1,Trouble free download. I would recommend because of price and ease of download. Now I have to get used to as opposed to Windows7.
1,"I've been using turbo tax for many years now, it works pretty well... Tax time is the most annoying period of time and I don't know how I would do my taxes without TurboTax"
1,I've used Turbo Tax for years even when we had a dairy farm.  It makes filing taxes very easy.
1,Wonderful free download that we use all the time and a great add for practice of multiplication tables!!!
1,Use this every year for about 14 years now.  Have had no problems...like the ease of it as well as the quality.
1,"Although completely different than the standalone version, it functions well.  Wish there was a way to customize some of the screens.  It is somewhat inflexible when it comes to individual needs."
0,Problems using the code provided but all was resolved very satisfactorily by Amazon customer Service.
0,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since the early 90s.  But evidently, that doesn't matter at all to Intuit.  While I usually purchased the Home and Business edition, I didn't think I needed it this year, as I closed my business.  But I purchase Deluxe, and find I need Sch D.  No problem, says Intuit...we can upgrade you for a mere $30. (see pic)  But then I go online to their site, and they offer the Premier Ed. for only $20 more than Deluxe.  (see pic)  Sooo....what's the deal Intuit?  Do you PUNISH your loyal customers for $10 for picking the wrong version?  That's a great way to retain customers!  You really screwed the pooch this time.   EDIT: After contacting Intuit (took 30 min on hold) they agreed to upgrade for free.  That process was painless, at least.  2 more stars and they just might keep me as a customer."
0,"Download continually failed with an error: Unable to find Content-Disposition in header.<br />I have the key but I do not have the software. Should have purchased from one of the office stores...at least when I deal with them, I can contact a person to help solve the problem. Finally found a phone number, but the tech rep could not help and is not knowledgeable about the subject.<br />EDIT: The Pro Pack is for people who already have Windows 8 installed and want to upgrade to the pro version. You DO NOT need to download the software. Go to \\""Add Features to Windows 8\\"" (just do a search in the start menu under settings) and enter the new key."
1,"I found out about Avast! Free Antivirus years ago when a group of people began recommending it.  The updates are regular and hassle free (no major downloads/re-starting your computer) and it has kept me free of virus and other catastrophes.  I used to use McAfee and very early on, Norton.  The latter didn't seem to keep me too well protected and the former was a pain as far as updates and special security add-ons when risks were high.  Avast! Free doesn't make you jump through hoops and, as I already stated, kept me safe.  They do, from time-to-time, try to entice me to buy some of their other products but have never done anything to make me feel that by not doing so I may be at greater risk.  So far I haven't purchased new products but if I choose to down the road, it will definitely be with Avast!  It is better than all the money I ever spent prior and it doesn't cost me a penny."
0,Very disappointing to get the software downloaded and then I am unable to use it. Call customer service first. Trust me.
1,great prices and quick delivery
0,"I have had problems with Garmin downloading before, but their devices work very well. This time however, I have finally run out of patience. I have been through their web site, and my account on their web site, for the last few hours trying to update my NUVI 1350T with the software upgrade I just wasted my money on. I am able to sign on and the site shows all of my items and software purchases; however, when I try up update my unit, the site goes dumb and informs me that I don't have an account there. I have finally had enough...... I am going to put both of my NUVI 1350T units out on the internet for sale and purchase some units that will provide me with adequate support. I saw other reviews stating problems.... I wish I had listened, saved my money and kept my blood pressure below 2000! CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />C.D.Keeley<br />an ex- Garmin customer"
0,"I have used this product for a few years and it has always done a good job in preventing a virus or other things to destroy our family computers. Norton can be pretty intrusive at times but I guess that is the price we pay for computer security. It is very easy to download, pretty easy to set up, and it does run in the background. The only difficulty I had was when I installed a new router. For whatever reason they clashed and it took me a while to work my way through that."
1,Terrific.  Fulfills all my needs for organizing and working with photos.  Had used Photo Shop for years but like this better.
1,"I was looking for the version for anime studio 9 and was excited when I found it!  I downloaded it and worked through it. Most lessons have a video of the finished project, step by step video and written tutorial (same as video). I found all to be very helpful. I feel much more confident about following other tutorials now.<br />Only gave 4 stars, because I would like to see it contain more lessons."
0,"For the life of me, I cannot get this software to download. Every time I go to help and perform the suggestions and reinstall, I get a new/different error message! SO FRUSTRATED I WANT TO THROW MY COMPUTER ACROSS THE ROOM!"
0,"An update for what I tried.     (1) The H&R Block software is not a bad choice in computing taxes.  However, the download option (from financial intitutions) is much limited. If you have many transactions in trading, TurboTax is still a better choice.    (2) Intuit's pricing is a mess.  As an example, there are two TTD on Amazon.  One is \\""Fed+State+Fed Efile\\"" for $49.97.  Another one is \\""Fed+Fed Efile\\"" for $39.99.  Yet, as tested with my colleagues, both copies come only with free printed State Filing (both can download on state filing).  This make us who paid $49.97 like  fool.  With this, my rating is not changed.    Intuit is no longer a company trustworthy for a long term relationship, regardless what they do now as a temporary touch-up.  The typical trend in the software industry is to provide more functions for the same ore less cost.  It appears Intuit is going against this trend.  This is truly a bad business decision, regardless whether Intuit admits it or not.  With a rate so low on Amazon.com, I am surprised to see that the VP of Intuit still expects to garner NEW customers (by providing only free upgrades to returning ones).  This tells us something about the wisdom of Intuit's management, and their attitude toward customers.    I purchased a CD as I used to do for many years before I found this discussion.  Guess I am qualified to call for a free upgrade.  Yet, I'd rather try a free H&R Block offer (please search for SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com) and decided to return the TurboTax CD."
0,"This is absolutely the worst Quicken product ever released, and I have been a Quicken user for over 20 years . DO NOT buy it now (R4 is the latest revision.)  Quicken Online Backup does not work with it, and there are many many unanswered and not attended to comments with problems shown on the support site.  I cannot imagine who it could be who decided that this product was ready to sell - but I'm betting it was someone who felt that selling it and recording some revenue was VERY important to Intuit because it needed that revenue to report results that met expectations.  Speaking personally, regardless of price, sale, or persistence in reminders, it will be a cold day in hell before I every sign onto any future version of Quicken before I see a lot of favorable reviews for it."
0,"What a joke....  First they change what has been offered, sneak in additional payments because you have to upgrade what you've bought, and then they offer an empty apology and say they'll give you a $25.00 rebate to make up for it.  I've tried numerous times to get the rebate off of their website and spoken to their representative over the phone but still they can't verify that I am eligible.  In the past, TurboTax had been wonderful but after this year I'll be looking else where for my tax prep software.  It's just not worth the headache and frustration."
1,"I have been purchasing H&R Block &#34;At home&#34; products for several years now.<br />Pros - Simple to use, &#34;Deduction Pro&#34; now built-in for estimating value of donated clothing.<br />Downloading was easy too.  I used to buy the discs, never used them after installation.<br /><br />Con - If you need to file in multiple states, each state copy costs more that I like, but is low enough that I am willing to pay."
1,I've been a Quicken user since version ONE. Only complaint is being forced by Intuit to upgrade to 2015 or loose the ability to update with the bank.
0,"multi-currency support is bad, but that's my main complaint. everything else is okay, only better option would be a homebrew excel file"
1,"After trying to track my expenses using Excel and saving paper receipts, I finally went with Quickbooks Online. One of the best business decisions I have made thus far!<br /><br />I love how it is connected with my bank and allows me to approve and catagorize each and every expense. Yes, I still save my receipts but now I have an electronic \\""paper trail\\"" as well.<br /><br />Quickbooks customer support is fantastic as they are very knowlegable and patient with my questions making sure I not only have my question answered but also that I understand how and why. I appreciate the personal attention.<br /><br />I am also using the reports to measure where I am spending money and then I can use that info for making my budget and sticking with my business plan. Being able to gather this data in such a concise way has been instrumental in measuring business trends and making decisions based on actuallity, not guesses.<br /><br />I know there is so much more to the program than I am able to utilize so I have enrolled in a \\""Quickbooks for Business\\"" course at the local college. I am very excited about this!<br /><br />One more thing...it makes tax time and giving my business info the my CPA a breeze. Just couldn't be happier!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Joy"
1,"A few years ago Norton had gotten bloated and slow. The reviews were harsh.<br />They went and rewrote everything and lately it has done a great job.<br />I have had Norton Internet Security for a few years (since the rewrite) and it has done well.<br />They have an auto renewal feature which will guarantee uninterrupted protection for only $70.<br />Instead you can buy this for less than half the price, enter the key and get another year!<br />I guess Norton is trying to maximize their profits but it seems kind of sneaky. If anything you should get a discount for auto renewal, not full price.<br /><br />Anyway, once you buy this you get a license key right away. If you already have Norton Internet installed you just start the renewal process and select &#34;enter key&#34;. TaDa, one more year of protection.<br /><br />BradmanOH"
0,I have been using TurboTax for at least 5 years and have always been happy with their products. This year I was very disappointed. I know that NC STATE was having some issues but I filed my taxes after that was corrected. My issue was that I was not able to electronically file my state taxes. I tried multiple times and called multiple times. Twice I was on hold for over 2 hours and never spoke with a rep. Next year I plan on using a different software and I will recommend that to anyone who asks. That is terrible customer service and beyond my tolerance level. The only reason I have 2 stars was because I was able to easily electroniclly fine my federal.
1,It is fine. They could improve search for previously fill in items.
1,Good
1,it has been working great my computer has been working fine no blue screen I would recommend this item to anyone
0,Norton disabled my printer.  Had to uninstall the Norton software.
1,"I purchased Rosetta Stone to return to studying Russian.  I first took the free tutorial on Rosetta Stone's web site (which I highly recommend before purchasing).  I am extremely impressed by how well the software forces you to think, speak, pronounce, and read.  I had two and half years of college study a decade ago, and if I had access to this kind of tool then I would likely be fluent today.<br /><br />Don't think that you can learn a new language through this tool alone, research some additional grammar texts or courses as well.  If you are anything like me and somewhat oblivious to crucial grammar terms, tenses, and forms you will become hopelessly lost in Russian without deep grammar study, which is not provided by this program.  It's brutal but necessary.  However, if you switch between the grammar and traditional self study and support those studies with Rosetta Stone you will learn rapidly and well.<br /><br />If you just want to converse quickly, Rosetta Stone is designed specifically for you.  The program will force you to speak, correctly, more than you may feel comfortable.  This is its best feature.  It will also repeat what you learn in future lessons, so don't worry if you miss some points, they will return.  You can also jump around in the program as much as you want, it doesn't lock you into completing one lesson before viewing future lessons.<br /><br />Finally, it come with three months on online subscription to language games and live tutoring, which I don't use much so I can't really review that aspect.<br /><br />If you are a serious learner, or not so serious and simply want to dip into something new, it is well worth the price."
1,Product has good functionality and flexibility for environments that do not fit neatly into pre-designed templates. User friendly - although what has actually been improved by changes is not always clear and sometimes causes minor use issues.  Overall an excellent product for accounting and financial management.
1,"For a small business owner; they have a tendency not to pay themselves. They then buy items without looking closely at the cost or maintance. I use the  expense charts as an easy way to \\""rein them in\\"". It's not my job to tell the owner how to \\""spend their money\\"" but to help them make those vital decisions, with past performance and cost analysis. I could do the charts myself, but it would take days to get the same results. Depending on the business, some can just use the Pro and never go on-line for invoices or bookkeeping. It converts easily to on-line if the company grows or your CPA is geographically separate."
1,Very Helpful for getting though the tax law buracy and making sure that you get all the deductions available you.
0,Very disappointed. Bought this software particularly to use the mobile quicken but it is not usable at all. There is server error message whenever I try to sync the desktop quicken. This is the 1st step one has to do before he can use the Quicken mobile. Contacted intuit quicken for solution but apparently they have not solve this problem yet.  Reading the forum and noted that this problem is a known issues for many months. I would expect a good and efficient company will quickly resolved such a major fault in their software design but unfortunate intuit has failed to do that.
1,My computer &#34;expert&#34; uses this and recommends it.
0,"I am an avid Google Drive user, but wanted to switch my photo hosting over to Amazon Cloud. Unfortunately, the sync software provided by Amazon is a joke. There is no semblance of a folder structure on the cloud drive, and worst of all: This is merely a &#34;dumb&#34; application. All you can do is upload files to the cloud and look at them. There is no ongoing synchronization to ensure that the source and destination remain mirrors. If I later add a file to a folder on my computer, there is nothing in the background that runs to sync that new file to the cloud.<br /><br />Absolutely horrible implementation. I love everything about Amazon and Amazon Prime, but this is a complete bust. There are only two explanations I can think of:<br />1) Amazon got threatened by Google or someone else if they made this program to similar in features, or<br />2) They're crippling it on purpose so they can offer you free unlimited photo storage knowing that few people would go through the hassle with this software.<br /><br />I'm seriously scratching my head here wondering what's going on."
1,"Without a doubt, a very sleek and awesome editor.  Great for photo retouching, but we use it for web graphics and for print ready graphics too - at least the ones going to VistaPrint.  Pretty good editor!"

1,Use it every year. One year I used a different software and just wasn't good enough. So far no issues.
0,"I bought this online and tried to install it, but after wasting much time for it to upload it would not work.  Had to go to the store and purchase it so that my computer was secured.

1,Great program and even better with the Ancestry subscription. However I havem't found how to do maps to show migration or all places.
0,"I've had Norton as my main computer protection for many years.  This year's changes, however, are not pleasing.  Norton has changed the vault to their servers and you no longer have the option of a local vault.  In addition, there is a very annoying Facebook Share button on the Norton Toolbar that you cannot remove.  It is maddening how so many applications assume everyone wants to use Facebook.  There was no problem buying and downloading from Amazon for my renewal.  It is much cheaper than automatically renewing with Norton or using the Norton site to renew."
0,"I want my Norton 360 back!  This is basically junk. It doesn't scan your hard drive, it only scans files that are downloaded from the internet. Any anti-virus software can do that, including the FREE Windows Defender. Norton 360 scanned, got rid of old cookies, did performance cleanup, etc., this version does nothing - AND you have to turn it on manually!  If I forget to launch it, the Windows &#34;unprotected&#34; message blinks and I have to manually click on it to turn it on. I've had Norton since my first Apple II and this will be the last version I purchase."
0,"Had a problem with the product not updating.  I waited an hour or so.  When it happened on both my computers at the same time, I realized it was a problem on Norton's end, so I stressed less.  I updated an hour or so later, went through without any trouble.  I had another problem that was either a Norton problem or might or might not have actually been a virus infection.

There was not product key in the email either.<br />Where's the product key????"
1,Very good easy to use served me good
1,This was the best price I found and it was very easy to download.  You just need to know that you need to copy the product key and paste it when the Norton window prompts you.  That's it.
1,LOVE it!!!
1,Downloaded the Turbo Tax software and immediately began my Federal and State tax input.  I had already gathered all the materials needed to complete the requirements.  This was the 10th year I have used Turbo Tax and found it to be the easiest!  From download to filing both State and Federal was less than an hour.  Great job for the developers of this years software!
0,it filters out known viruses but not sure if it restricts browser add-on malwares or script based malwares or whatever that slows down your browser sessions. overall its protects ok but i expected better prevention for the browser malwares and unwanted processes that are run by malicious malwares etc.
1,Fun to learn for all ages.
1,It works fine except for an installation failure where it failed to install some file which causes a temporary startup error.
1,"Just installed '15 (PC) over '12 as required by the expiration of '12 for online transactions. The upgrade went very smoothly, and the appearance is familiar. Haven't done much yet, but everything looks good so far. I especially like the checkmark on the reconcile dialog: \\""Always use online balance. Don't ask me again.\\""  They also fixed the One Step Update so it is only one step now.  But Quicken still hasn't solved the Find issue: when using right-click/Find on a transaction in the register, the first drop box default is still \\""any field\\"" rather than the field that was selected. E.g. if you do right-click/Find on a amount field, it should come up with Amount in the first drop box. Not major but still annoying. Four stars because of this, otherwise, five stars so far.    New info: They also did not fix the mouse wheel scroll on the \\""Manage Bill Income Reminders\\"" and \\""Online Payee List\\"". Surprisingly it works on the \\""Category List\\"" and \\""Memorized Payee List\\""."
1,"Like most of the others here, I purchased the digital download and then waited.  And waited.   And waited some more.  I received the email that my purchase had processed about an hour after I bought it on-line.  I expected another email to follow shortly with the map code but that email never came.  Frustrated I went back to my order page to try to find out what the hold up was.  I then noticed a button on the right side of the browser window labeled \\""Go to Your Software Library.\\""  I clicked it and there, in relatively fine print, I found the the map code I needed to download the 2010 Lifetime Map.  I had already registered my nuvi 750 so once I logged in I went to 'myDashboard' to see where I could enter the code.  I didn't find an obvious place that said something like \\""Enter map code here\\"" but I did find an \\""Activate gift card\\"" link on the \\""myMaps\\"" tab of the myGarmin page.  I clicked it, entered the code copied from my Amazon Software Library and - Eureka! - there was my download approval and link.  The Software Library button may have been there all along and I just didn't notice it.  It's the next day now and still no map code email so don't expect one immediately, maybe ever.  My 2 gig download on hi-speed DSL took about an hour.  Count on a couple of more to unzip the executable, copy all the files to your local or external hard drive, then install everything.  Once I figured out how to get my map code from Amazon and the map updates from Garmin, the rest was (slow and) easy.  I'd give this 5 stars if Amazon and/or Garmin made this process more obvious."
0,"As I really have not used the product in a great deal, I did want to warn people about a few things:<br /><br />1. Typical Adobe - Adds in bloatware and installs w/o you acknowledging it.<br />2. Mac version is limited compared to Windows (i.e. no slideshow capability)<br />3. Mac version is not retina compatible, so it looks old school.<br />4. Uninstall requires you to kill a process so the uninstaller can work.  Does not seem to take advantage of the drag into the trashcan approach for most software.<br /><br />If you are Windows based, this might be a good product for you.  Please read the other reviews.  If you are a Mac user, just be aware of the limitations."
0,I was forced to buy the deluxe this year to cover my small business needs. I was not happy about the extra expense. Hopefully this will be remedied by next year.<br />I liked the lay out of the program and found it easy to use.
0,"I had so many problems with it.  I've used it three times, but this time it was so frustrating to use."
1,"Avast! works well and stays out of the way...mostly. You will get some Avast! pop-ups prompting you to add their premium service or advising you of new threats, and sometimes Malwarebytes will detect threats which Avast! did not, but overall this is one of the best free antivirus programs."
0,"If you want a simple to learn music making program, this is the program for you. It is good at what it does yet it does not have as much customization as I would have liked. This is a good base for learning how to make music."
0,"The idea of paying $240 a year for the right to use Dreamweaver (in 4 years that's nearly $1,000) seem exorbitant.<br />I think Adobe has gotten a bit greedy with this pricing structure.<br />Definitely will be exploring other alternatives."
1,This is third year I bought this product from Amazon. It is easy to install and it keeps my computer safe and secure from malicious attacks. The price offered by Amazon is the lowest in the marketplace.
1,Had an older version of this program and when we got a new computer got the new edition.  Lots easier to use and track spending
0,"1.  Almost lost all my old data which I wanted to keep on computer because data must be transferred to QuickBooks latest version BEFORE transfer to Online system.<br />2.  Help Line is understaffed, and sometimes tech doesn't have a clue about their system, thus hard for them to really solve some problems.  Make no mistake, you aren't getting a perfect Support system, but you are paying.  It is better than nothing (the old system)<br />3.  Old vendors can't be deleted nor made inactive if any balance is shown--even if I don't want them, they can't be removed."
1,"I got the 2013 disk from TaxCut but they wanted $40 for the federal plus state and federal e-file. So, I checked Amazon and got the download version for a lot less.<br /><br />I've used TaxCut for years and find it does a fine job."
0,"Got MS Publisher 2013 for work. If you have used earlier incarnations, you won't have any problem getting up to speed. Microsoft hasn't messed with it like they did with Word and Excel, so you can usually find the commands you are looking for and put together your document."
1,"Norton was easy to install and works well on all products. I encountered a problem when I first tried to install on my PC, which still had another brand of security software that need to be taken off. I called and customer service was great. I got a follow up call to let me know I could call them if I had any further issues."
1,Another great product from Intuit. Have used Quicken since it came out and upgrade to the 2015 app. Upgrade was easy and everything works just as I expected.
1,"That's right, it's your decision!<br /><br />You get the downloadable version for 65% cheaper with all the benefits that expensive piece of plastic gives! I am extremely content with my purchase, and love the feeling of buying online off a trusted source! I recommend this to anyone needing virus protection. (:<br /><br />Pros on getting this product?:<br /><br />• Delivered straight to your PC, so there's absolutely no package waiting time! (beside the actual download)<br />• Cheap, and I mean a whooping 65% off cheap from $90.00 USD! (some stores going as high as $110.00 USD for the CD!)<br />• Would you rather harm the world and wait 217 years for a CD to discompose or buy this? Your choice!<br /><br />Cons on getting this product?:<br /><br />• You might get a disconnecting issue like I had, but after the third attempt it downloaded with flying colors!<br />• A deal this good awakens your skepticism, but I assure you it's 100% safe!"
1,"I have used Quicken for years and Quicken 2015 is the fastest, easiest, most user-friendly version yet.  I consolidate all my financial information in Quicken and I truly couldn't live without it.  It also integrates most information easily into TurboTax (which I have also used for years)."
1,"I am a retired, inactive CPA who used to file taxes for clients. I now use TurboTax because I find it efficient, informative and accurate to file mine own and my family member's tax returns."
0,I upgraded to 2013 because I was informed by Intuit that I would no longer have access to one-step downloads of data unless I did so.  The new program freezes constantly and does not download data properly.  It does not interact well with certain financial sites.
1,I am very happy with Norton Security with Backup.  I have so much more now than I had with 360.
1,"I've been using Quickbooks for many, many years and it's the best accounting program out there.  Easy to use and intuitive.  You should get it because you'll love it too!"
0,"So had to upgrade to keep the down load active, since that service was going to be cut off by my old product.  So everything looked to convert fine, until the first sync. All my credit card accounts worked, but my checking account would not. It keeps on telling me that the account is closed, or that I must have renamed it etc. Does not sync. Had to deactivate that account (where I had over 10 years worth of data on) and then start a new account (in quicken).  Also had issues with me putting in nick names for the accounts.<br />  The other piece I did not like was that you must now create a cloud account to active the product and sync with it ie. you now must have a quicken id.  I am so tired of services I do not want...if I wanted a cloud service I would have signed up for mint or some other such free service...<br />  On the positive side, they do have a mobile app that does sync with the cloud, so you can see where you are financially no matter where you are.  I am not a fan of specific financial apps on the cell phone, because it is the single most stolen piece of property now in America... which means your finances are at the hands of criminals.  If you do use this new feature make sure you do the following 3 things (free security advice from a security guy)<br />1. Buy an app for your phone that will remotely lock,locate and wipe it. There are free ones and ones under $9 a year.. do it.<br />2. Set up your phones screen saver to auto lock with a numeric pass code (not a swipe pattern, because your fingers will leave a smudge that you can see the pattern...try it sometime with a friends phone...great party trick.. not).<br />3. The quicken app also has a pass code, set this and make it something different than your phones lock code.<br />  All and all it does everything it use to do, but was a pain to upgrade this time around. If you are new to the product, it is better than the Microsoft money and a couple of others. I would recommend it for a brand new user."
0,Amazon download doesn't function.  It spins and says &#34;connection lost.&#34;  Huge waste of time.  Either offer a product key like with other software to download from the publisher or fix your download application.
0,"the entire process was awful,"
0,"The truth? I’ve used some form of Norton for something like 7 years, but I'm starting to doubt the necessity of this product now that Windows' native anti-spam and firewall have improved. I have a more sophisticated Password Manager now ... If I hadn't had so many problems with it over the years requiring hours of support calls, I’d be happier, but the painful customer support has moved me to wanting to not continue with it."
0,"On the promise of this software being compatible with Windows 8  I purchased it, downloaded  it but it does not work.  I put this this software on a Windows 7 computer and it worked fine."
1,"Its easy enough to use. I think its a little overpriced for what it is, but I was able to do what I needed with it!"
1,"Avast is my choice because , it does it's job without slowing doing my system, and without consuming a lot of my time. Simply put it's the best Anti-virus software on the market.  Updates are lightning fast and if you ever have reason to uninstall it , well that's lightning fast also. Try uninstalling some of the more well known anti-virus products...prepare to lose a lot of your precious time.<br /><br />In terms of protection against viruses, Avast is just tops!.  All of my family and friends, and their friends come to me for help getting rid of viruses, that their PCs have acquired while using other anti-virus software. Once they start using Avast, no more problems. Before I get them to switch to Avast, they are a pain in my neck (both family and friends, but they won't see this review). After they start using Avast, no more virus problems!!  So I love Avast.<br />Avast even speaks to let you know when an update has occurred. If i could I would give it ten stars."
0,"This would be better served to interview each catagory with definition so the person using it who is not a CPA can get the most of the product, without spending hours figuring it out."
1,"I have tried several antivirus software over the years, such as Panda, AVG, Norton, etc. The BEST ONE so far is Avast. My computer has less viral infections, if my computer is infected, I am alerted and usually is a mild virus; malware and spyware are localized and deleted. I have the option of otpimizing my computer with a quick and cheap in-app purchase. The virus database is constantly updated. The best thing: IT WORKS and always have the option of updating and the protection options keep growing for a better and concise protection."
1,"Best price available for a Great Product.  Download was flawless.  A pleasure to purchase, install, and use this software with no hassles."
1,"I switched from the desktop version to the online version after careful consideration of the pros/cons.  Two primary factors moved me to the online version:  Simplicity and Accessibility.<br /><br />Simplicity:  The layout and functionality is 90% intuitive, and the help section usually closes any gaps for me.<br /><br />Accessibility:  I have two businesses on the account.  Each is accessible to users that I designate (including the ever-important accountant and bookkeeper), from any location with internet connectivity.  Further, the apps for both Droid and Mac devices work very well."
1,"Good UI but possible slow down on Full Scan, other than that I like this antivirus software than others using it for past 7 years."
0,Not even close to Microsoft office.  Ridiculous but free
1,"I looked at several stores for this product but it was around $59.  Was happy to see it here cheaper.  I have used PSP for over 10 yrs but got behind on upgrading so I had to pay full price again.  Great software, like it a lot more that Photoshop."
1,"Did everything I wanted it to do, very easy to follow the instructions."
1,great product.  i have used it every year for the last 10 years.  cant think of a why i would go have someone else do my taxes.
1,I have used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it is improved and easier to use.  I use Quickbooks for my business and the seamless interface between the two products makes tax preparation effortless (almost).  Would highly recommend any of the Intuit products.
0,"Wow.... You would think with all the clout that AWS has to offer that Amazon could do much better here... There are clearly Network/Storage capacity issues with this service.  Video streams buffer after 1s it's awful.  Photo browsing reminds me of the 1990s services it's so slow.<br /><br />There are no go clients, only browser based tools.  No great management for de-duplication etc.  Ouch it's awful."
1,Have used Turbo Tax several years and have had no problems.
1,"I have been a quicken user since 1995 and have gone through numerous upgrades and all they entail.  I have always been a big fan of quicken and have come to expect seamless and easy transitions from one version to the next.  Transitioning from Q10 to Q13 brought one major disappointment so far in that my laboriously created 2013 personal budget did not transition without some strange errors.  It was relatively easy to see what was wrong with the new budget presentation layout.  Some expense categories had been moved to the Income Group of categories and all categories in the income group had been arbitrarily divided into two separate income groups, one labeled \\""income\\"" and the other labeled \\""personal income\\"".  And, these two groups were separated in the budget presentation by the expense group!  It was difficult to correct this as the system would not let me do the obvious \\""fix\\"" which would be to move the incorrectly grouped category back to expenses and put all the income categories together in one group.  Happily, I stumbled across an indirect solution that appears to have fixed everything.  In summary, I'm a long time user whose faith has been somewhat shaken by a flawed transition to the upgrade version.  Hopefully, there will be no more gremlins still to come to the surface as I'm only about three weeks into Q13."
1,"I had it for less than a month.  But, it already very helpful.  I am looking forward to using it more."
1,I have tried them all and this seems to be better than most. I know if you try it you will see I am right!
1,It is simplified for anyone to use.  Quick and efficient.
1,"I can't remember not having quicken, and it's the only steady software other than windows that I have and use daily.  It is not necessary to update it every year, but the cost is minimal compared to what I use it for."
1,I have used Quicken many years.
1,Great product at a bargain price
1,I think this is the perfect program for every home.
1,can't beat it
1,"Great product, easy to use, effective and does not affect computer performance, a must have one. I recommend to buy it as pc Download, so you will have a chance to install it in 3 computers. Buy it, you will be happy to have it."
1,"It really make my laptop to be clean of any viruses , Trojans , web adds. It isn't get infected since I bought this product."
1,"Background    A Microsoft Money user since Money 2005, I found myself on the \\""losing\\"" side of a two-way battle between Money and Quicken for the personal finance software space.  When Microsoft made the announcement that Money was no longer going to be supported or updated, I knew I had to make the switch.  I wanted to change over to Quicken quickly so I could successfully run both programs concurrently for a few months.    My use of Microsoft Money Deluxe    I basically used the Deluxe version of Money to adhere to a budget, manage income and expense transactions, as well as forecast how much money I would have by a certain date.  To accomplish the last goal, I used the Money program to created reports which I downloaded into Excel, and then kept up with formulas in an Excel spreadsheet.   I did not use the bill pay or planning features.      My intended use of Quicken Premier     I wanted to make the step change that I avoided with Money because it would involve a lot of work - namely, this was treating all transactions as a change to net worth instead of  a just an income or expense item.  For example, in Money I simply treated my mortgage payment as an expense.  In Quicken, I am now treating the interest payment as an expense and the principle payment as a transfer to reduce my mortgage loan principle.  In other words, after working with Money for some time I realized I did not set things up optimally, so I used this forced change as a way to start over and do things the right way.  I could have done this with Money as well, but I never did because I had so much history and other processes/macros set up.  Also, I intended to do everything in Quicken, which is why I stepped up to the premier version from Money's deluxe version.    The transition    My experience actually importing Money data into Quicken is not as bad as other reviewers have reported.  All of my transaction history ported over with minimal effort.  All in all, I would give this an 8/10.   I willmake some notes below that prevent it from being a 10/10 that hopefully Intuit can address:  *  The Money transactions port over as ALL CAPS while the new Quicken transactions are in Proper Case.  Quicken reads this as two different payees - so automatic bill setting and getting history by payee is not ideal  *  Because of the point above, there are a number of duplicate transactions for the weeks that financial institutions currently report - usually the current 90 days.  *  The default categories in Money transfer over fine and are sometimes changed to the default equivalent in Quicken, which is fine.  However, for user-defined categories there is work to be done.  For example, I had created City Income Tax as a subset of Tax in Money, but Quicken does not recognize it as a tax.  *  I do not like how Quicken puts the cash part of investment accounts as a separate entity from the non-cash part.  In Money, my IRA was simply one account and there was a subset of transactions that were investment or cash related.  In Quicken, they are two accounts - which is an awkward way to handle it.  When I try to change the new \\""cash\\"" accounts to investment accounts, Quicken stops me saying it will delete all cash transactions.  Not wanting to recreate 5 years of investment transactions, I let it have its way.    First Month Experience    If you are like me, it could take a lot of time to make the transition.  I literally spent HOURS getting everything right, despite starting from a very clean Money file.  Again, I think the bulk of this is because I fundamentally wanted to change how I worked in Quicken relative to Money.  It would have taken a good deal of time to have made the change in Money too.  However, I was new to Quicken so things were simply taking me even longer.  The export to text feature is not nearly as good as Money's export to CSV feature, but I hope to rely less on exporting anyway.  As of now I have all transactions in, all bill reminders set, a Spending Planner created, and a good sense of holistic Net Worth.    The interface    Others have mentioned it, but the interface really is not as slick as it is in Money.  The best way I could put it is that Money looks like it was created by professional programmers while Quicken looks like it was created by amateur programmers.  However, with the clunky interface also comes greater flexibility to do/change things and more speed to create reports.  I am more of a function over form kind of guy, so I think the tradeoffs are mostly positive.    Conclusion    Despite mentioning things in my review that I did not like, I am happy overall with the change.  There really isn't anything Money Deluxe 2007 could do that Quicken Premier 2010 can't.  It might do things differently, which longtime Money users might find quirky, but it does them (at least stuff I did).  While it might look rough around the edges and take you a long time to get it exactly as you want it, it is probably a better program than Money overall.  I am continually impressed by how flexible the program is and how many \\""I wish Money could do...\\""s that it can do.  Put another way, after 5 years of working in Money, I am pretty much 100% on Quicken and have had it for just a month.  I feel I have a better understanding of my net worth and my day-to-day cash flow.  The program has enough features and reports that I no longer feel the need to supplement it with Excel work as I did with Money.  In summary, I recommend making the switch, prepare to spend a lot of time getting it the way you want, and get to know some of the neat things that Quicken can do."
0,"I bought this for the mobile app.  Well, I haven't gotten it to work as yet!  Quicken needs to do a lot more testing before they release their upgrades!"
0,"The standalone version is not the newest version of LR. If you want to get the most updated version, you need to go for Lightroom CC.<br />The little pro first: This is a great software for managing and editing your photos. I won't deny this.<br />However, I had the bad experience of downloading the trial, tried it, the de-haze function is amazing. But once I purchased the standalone version, the dehaze function disappeared! Apparently it is not available in the standalone version. So to me it almost, almost felt like a bait and switch. A very unpleasant feeling and I lost trust in Adobe.<br /><br />Sure, they will argue that you purchased the standalone version, you can't keep having upgrades (think software long ago). I don't dispute that, but at least be upfront about it in a very clear manner. At least here I present you my experience just to keep you informed. Hope it helps. If I were mistaken, I hope someone from Adobe can right this. So far, I'm a very very disappointed customer!"
0,Who is running this operation? I was happy with the product until the price gouging for the extra schedules. Looking to take advantage of H&R Blocks offer for free software for sure.
0,Product has malicious malware encrypted in it.  DON'T Download.  Cost me a couple of hundred dollars to get PC fixed and Amazon does not refund software purchases.  Can't tell you how upset I am with Amazon and this product.
0,"Norton works fine - once you can get it to install properly!  Renewed on 2 computers: computer 1, IE11 would not even open after the first install of Norton, but Chrome worked fine.  Everything okay after second install of Norton.  Computer 2, could not send any email from Gmail or Hotmail after first install, everything okay on second installation.  I know almost every computer has different configurations, but Symantec needs to do more testing of their products before release.  I've used Norton for years and every year I encounter some sort of installation problem!"
0,"couldn't figure out how to go less than one star. TurboTax KNOWING they have a comsumer crisis brewing, sent out an email to me (I assume all past Deluxe customers) offering deluxe for $30. NO advisory about their &#34;changes&#34;, just a quick email hoping to catch ppl before they hear about the rip off.<br /><br />I plan to go with HR Block and return their CD when I get it."
1,"So far, so good!  I'm using it right now, and haven't had any security issues!"
1,"I'm a semi-truck driver, and needed a good mapping program.  Compared to Delorme Street Atlas USA (2014), this is the better of the two.<br /><br />I tested each by mapping a standard trip that I frequently make: from Sumner, WA to Great Falls, MT.  My truck is governed at 62 mph, and I customarily drive this route in 10 hours and 50 minutes - a single day trip (DOT rules don't allow me to drive more than 11 hours).  The trip is 651 miles.<br /><br />Delorme maps this trip at 696.38 miles.  It does not take the logical routes of WA-18 or MT-200, no matter which route setting I select (&#34;Shortest&#34; or &#34;Quickest&#34;).<br /><br />To follow the Delorme route would cost me 45 minutes, and I could not have finished the trip in one day.  Also, considering that diesel is now nearly $4 per gallon, the Delorme route would have wasted 7 extra gallons of fuel (45 miles / 6.5 mpg) - at a cost of approximately $28. The Delorme product can be manually tweaked by &#34;Via&#34; points, but I shouldn't have to do this.<br /><br />I returned the Delorme product, and bought Microsoft Streets and Trips instead.  I personally find it more intuitive and easier to figure out than the Delorme product.  I mapped the same trip (Sumner, WA --&#62; Great Falls, MT) and it mapped it perfectly, using both WA-18 and MT-200.<br /><br />Another advantage of the Microsoft product is the after-market work on the Points of Interest.  If you Google &#34;The Points of Interest Mega File,&#34; you'll see what I mean.  They have added a LOT of trucker-friendly (and RV-friendly) information, such as Walmarts that allow parking, Costco, Sam's Club, Cracker Barrel restaurants, Rest stops in each state, etc - things that might not have been included in the original released version.  Literally thousands of new entries.  Nice!<br /><br />The one complaint that I have about the Microsoft product - and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 - is that the POIs don't include Churches in the &#34;find nearby places&#34; list.  This was a surprise to me - especially considering some of the other rather obscure categories that were included.  (The Delorme product did list Churches, but did not distinguish between denominations - it was a mess, but it was there.)  The Microsoft product didn't list any Churches at all."
0,It was terrible!  I was not able to edit the layout of the checks. I licked my old software for the PC better.
1,"As always quick, accurate and easy."
1,This was very simple to install. No glitches whatsoever! I have had Norton 360 for the last few years. Never any problems. Thanks Amazon.
0,I just have to suck it up and go back to TurboTax. This is to awkward and it cant import the filings so the risk of doing a typo is to big.
0,It usually very good. This year H&R Block screwed up. Anyone with a form 8863 that was submitted the middle of Feb was not sent correctly over to the IRS. Data was missing. Normally I get my refund in 10 days to two weeks. This time almost 3 months. Very disappointed this year.
1,"For a startup tech company, QuickBooks Online has worked perfectly for me with practically no orientation time.  Everything was about where I would expect it to be and the user interface was pleasing to look at.  The last time I used QuickBooks was with a CD install software package 7 years ago, and they have made huge leaps in usability."
1,"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.<br /><br />H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.<br /><br />This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.<br /><br />Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps<br />1) Log into Amazon<br />2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page<br />3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in<br />4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software<br /><br />Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.<br /><br />I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.<br /><br />I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.<br /><br />1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.<br /><br />2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.<br /><br />3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.<br /><br />4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.<br /><br />5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!<br /><br />6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.<br /><br />7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.<br /><br />8.

1,Very good software.  I recommend to anyone wanting to get their finances in order. I think this is a Bery good software.
1,why pay for what should be free
1,"I have been using turbo tax,fed and state e-file for many years,There have been a few small errors,but for the most part I find turbo tax to be fast,reliable,accurate,and easy to follow.I definitely would recommend this software for the casual residential user."
1,"Easy install, has your back online.Same program that came with computer.Real fair price for a year subscrpition. Will buy another next time."
1,"I have been running this with my Win 7 laptop for 3 months now. So far so good. It haven't slowed down the system like Norton or Mcafee was doing, and moreover no sort of other issues related to virus has come out so far.<br /><br />When compared to the big time companies with constant updates, online activity scanning blah..blah..no one assures 100% protection, and that too for overpriced products.<br /><br />Not that I'm sure that this will protect me 100%, but as a free download, and the current level of service it is offering me I am happy. It does gives you notification or even blocks if you run a setup file not recognized by it ..etc.<br /><br />I haven't got any malware or spyware activities which bring you pop up ads, and eventually slows your system down after installing it.<br /><br />I'm pleased that it haven't slowed my system during boot up or while in use."
1,"I own & operate an indoor/outdoor movie company and purchased this program to play background music AND movies right from my laptop to keep things simple.  Combined with a new Blu-Ray optical drive on my Dell Inspiron N5050 with Windows 7 & 4gb RAM, I do not experience any playback issues.  The program works well.<br /><br />Point deducted because I do not like the way the menu is laid out, but it does the job and has all the features I need.  And the price was right.  Program was easy to install."
1,Good program. Not as user friendly as I anticipated cuz it gets confusing but it does offer tons of tutorials. We are still getting used to it
1,"This is one of the few ways you can still get an item from the creative suite prior to Creative Cloud.  I prefer owning my software, (as much as you can really own software) as opposed to renting or leasing it.  Adobe has finally made changes that are useful, as opposed to CS4, where Adobe was apparently thinking: &#34;Hey, let's take all the menus and toolbars, move them around in random order, take out the features our core users love, and put in a bunch of features that they'll never use, and will bog down their system.&#34;  CS6 still isn't perfect, but it's a world more functional though.  You just have to take the time to explore the features and changes to fully take advantage of them.  I use this software for 10+ hours a day, almost every day, and I couldn't get along without it.  I'm sure I'll move on to the CC versions of Adobe's software, but for now I'll cling to this &#34;legacy&#34; version.  I mean, it's almost 2 years old, so it's ANCIENT, right?  Also, it looks amazing on a MacBook Pro with Retina display!"
0,OK. Fairly intuitive. Functionality not what I hoped.
0,stupid boring product...save your money
0,"This version of Quicken has several Fatal Flaws - avoid at all costs.  The budget randomly adds or subtracts monthly totals - the yearly totals are usually completely wrong. Therefore the budget is not only wrong, but DANGEROUS to USE.  The reports also randomly add or subtract monthly totals. Again, reports are incorrect and useless.  Assuming you even try to use the budget, the new software will lock you out from past months. There is no way to update or correct January's budget in February for example.  The people at Intuit are either so incompetent they cannot program and did not test their software before release, or they have criminal intent.  AVOID AVOID AVOID"
1,I had my doubts but everything they claimed was true.  They claimed an idiot could use this this program and I'm here to tell you it's true.  I had no problem whatsoever using this system as it holds your hand through the entire process.  I'm a person that still has a VCR with 12:00 still flashing on top the TV set.<br /><br />Works great with the HP Envy 4500 printer.
1,Very good program for the price. It offers most all of the required processes needed for a professional photographer.
1,Amazon offered this book as a free download.  It was really quick and easy to download and my kids love coloring on it.
1,"Avast has been very reliable, I am very satisfied with this product. If I ever choose to upgrade It will be with Avast."
1,"I have been using TT for 10 years and it does everything as expected. As my needs have changed, TT has the products for me."
1,"work as expected, no issues"
1,Great Program
0,The game is fine but this is not the Carmen Sandiego I remember. My kids lost interest in it after playing it once.
1,Worked as advertised
1,"Item was as described, fast  delivery, Great seller. Thank You!"
1,I read all the negative feedback but after so many years of using TT it still does the job!
0,"It did not help with my computer, I uninstalled it"
1,"Works well in speeding up my computer.Finds and fixes problems fast, The best part about this software is that you get it right after you buy it no shipping.Downloads from amazon."
0,Getting a refund. Quicken user since 1993.
1,"I have used avast! antivirus from the first day that it was available. It is loaded on every PC that I own & any that I have serviced. It requires very little of the PC's RAM & processor time, so it does not slow the PC down. Updates are performed automatically & frequently & they are announced by a voice through your speakers. All tasks can be simply accomplished & require no reading of the manual. I rate it by far the best of the free antivirus software and as good or better than the pay for antivirus software."
1,"I always wait until the last minute to purchase my renewal Norton 360 which sells at a much higher price during this time of the year.  Anyway, download was simple and quick.  Also, I was able to print out my product key number for my other two computers.  #EasyAs123"
0,paid extra to e-file state electronically - charged twice and never went through
0,My 2013 wisconsin efile tax return was rejected by the state because Turbotax made an error. it posted my 2012 state refund amount as though I had used it to pay 2013 estimated tax taxes which I had not. I had taken the refund check from the state for personal use last year. This error caused my state return to reflect a refund when I actually owed money. The state rejected the efile since it had no record of any estimated taxes paid for 2013. I am using the state's efile software to file my 2013 state taxes and I want Turbotax to give me a credit for the state efile fee I paid them. Just try and get a customer service person the phone. I dare you. Very disappointed!
1,I really like this service and product.
1,"Available instantly, very user friendly.  The ability to see the updates on the forms cannot be overstated.  This took out all the confusion and helped identify some weak points in my own documentation.  I have used Turbo Tax in the past, but I see no reason in trying them again.  This works too well, and is far cheaper."
1,I HAVE BEEN USING QUICKBOOKS SINCE THE DOS VERSION AND THINK IT'S GREAT. IT CAN DO ANYTHING I NEED AND IS VERY ADAPTABLE. I USE IT FOR MY BUSINESSES AND MY PERSONAL FINANCES.
1,avast works really good for me  it has block my computer  from viruses twice already and I like the price being free  :)
0,It would be hard to put into words how horrible this program is.  I can from 10 years using Pinnacle 9 then 12 then 15 and they all got better as they went.  This POS is the most frustrating incomplete and difficult to use video editor there is. Never have I hated a program so much.
0,UNABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT
1,I love this program... I'm definitely going to get the newer version.
1,I have been using Avast for free for may years now (in combination with a few other freeware applications).  I have never had a problem with the program or with any viral infections.  This is what the internet is supposed to be about!
1,"I have been using TurboTax for several years now. It saves me literally hundreds of dollars that I was previously paying a tax profession, but allows me to quickly and easily complete my taxes and still feel confident that I've done everything correctly."
0,Would not download to my computer
1,"Great antivirus, I have used it for years and have  never had a problem with it. And you can't beat the price!"
0,"This is a pretty complicated program, but i suspect it is very powerful. It's just that it is not intuitive for the user."
1,"Can't beat the functions, educational media and price."
1,I've used the free version for several years. This year I purchased it on sale for $39.99 and it is so much better. I have more control over the shields and what and when is scanned.
1,"I have nothing but good luck using the free Avast Antivirus.  Been using it on my net book, desk top, cell phone and my wife's lap top for some time now and all is good."
0,"Just downloaded, really easy, fixing to try it out"
1,Easy to use and helpful information.
1,"After reading all the negative reviews, I almost didn't buy this year's TT. In the end, I'm glad I did. I used the Home & Business disk, not the download, on a Mac and it was the fastest I've ever done my taxes! No problem importing from 2007 info, no wait time for functions. It was a little pricey, but not as expensive as a CPA. As always, great product."
1,"I have switched between McAfee and Norton for about 4 or 5 years taking advantage of their competitive upgrades. But I have found McAfee to be hopelessly buggy, hanging my computers, and refusing to update properly (the most common troubleshooting suggestion is \\""uninstall and reinstall\\"").<br /><br />With 5 computers to protect, I went with the 5 pack NAV download. It was a no-brainer and I'll do it again at the end of the year. For $4/computer/year it's better than all the time I've wasted on McAfee."
1,Nice Prime perk.
1,"My husband and I run a very small business out of our kitchen. Every year I have to get my sister's help doing the taxes, she's a CPA. This year, along with the help of reports from Quick Books Pro, I was able to complete them by myself. What a great feeling. I also used the home version that comes with it to do our personal taxes. It was worth every penny."
0,Nothing better than the rest of the Anti Virus gang. 3 stars as it seems to be cheaper option to the more expensive ones. It has definitely slowed down my system.
0,"I've been using quickbooks for ten years. During that time I have spent many hours on the phone with the support technicians of intuit learning the system and correcting bugs. Now, i am quite handy using it.<br /><br />I would classify the product (in general) as a good piece of software. It takes some time to learn and use properly, but when you do know how to use it, the program is a great way to sort your business finances and report on them as well.<br /><br />This specific product mac 2012, is not a major update. Intuit might disagree, but as consumers we don't care about what intuit claims is a major feature - we care about actual usability, and in that regard I would consider the update from 2011 mac to 2012 mac a lipstick remodel.<br /><br />Online banking is still tempermental, and it does not work work with nearly as many institutions as a few other online financial programs. Web connect for MAc doesn't work with many institutions as it does on a PC. That surprises me, but it was confirmed via a conversation with an intuit support technician. It would seem the internet protocol would be the same, but it is not.<br /><br />Wave accounting, a free piece of software integrates much smoother with online portals for more banks than quickbooks mac, as an example. It also handles payroll and check printing.<br /><br />I would also like to make a counter statement to one of the replies to a review by another customer here on Amazon by the manufacturer's rep, Will. In it, he stated that Intuit offers upgrade pricing for people who have previous versions of the software already installed. This is a false statement. The upgrade option is not available on amazon.com, only through intuit, and through intuit the upgrade pricing is more expensive than the price at which amazon lists the full version. Inuit's upgrade pricing is also more expensive than the price listed in stores.<br /><br />While it may be nice to \\""say\\"" you offer discount upgrade pricing, in reality, thisis a misnomer. Discount pricing that costs more than regular pricing is no discount at all, and to say that in response to a review made specifically about a product for purchase on amazon (where the upgrade pricing is not applicable) is actually a patently false statement.<br /><br />Buy the program for its powerful accounting system, but if you don't know how to use it, expect to spend hours in training or getting help."
0,"Using this product is very challenging. If you want to hand enter every transaction it works great. But if you are expecting the program to download information from your financial institutions, forget it. Many institutions are not compatible, and even those that are seldom download. Very frustrating."
1,"I have had Quicken for a number of years and each upgrade has improved and made it easier for me to expedite my accounts. The latest addition has made it very easy to be lazy, because it does everything for me; I highly recommend Quicken 2015 to  anyone who is considering the program."
1,This works wonderfully. Even the free download keeps things up to date and running smoothly. Thank you.
1,very well thought out produce
0,"The advertising hype on TV is very misleading.  This product is not appropriate for any but the simplest business and the price tag is outrageous.  This is an inferior product compared to the desktop products (Pro, Premier, and Enterprise).  IMO, Intuit has pushed this product before it is ready for prime time and the tech support is not yet up to snuff.  Please consult a certified QuickBooks Pro Advisor (independent bookkeeper) before making this decision.  There are too many customers to count that have had to transfer their data back to QuickBooks desktop (QBD) from QuickBooks Online (QBO) at considerable cost (having to pay a consultant to fix it).  There are other options to &#34;remote&#34; access if that is a factor in the decision to purchase this product.  The general consensus from professional bookkeepers is that this product is not ready to use."
0,"I've always had great experience with Quicken for going on decades now. I went ahead and upgraded my 2011 version due to phase out next year. Very much wish I hadn't. The install seemed to take a lot longer time than in the past, particularly when importing/converting my data files. Then, every time I used the program, it crashed, multiple times. I initially installed on an Win XP Pro 64 bit computer with 4 GB of RAM and thought that was the problem. After doing a backup, I installed on a new Win 7 Pro 64 bit computer with 8 GB RAM (went much faster), restored the backup, and got it running no problem. However, it crashed even more frequently.<br /><br />Fortunately, the database stores data entered or downloaded immediately, so I haven't lost anything. But doing online updates will make the program just &#34;disappear&#34;, forcing a restart/try again with fingers and toes crossed that nothing got corrupted. Then, when manually entering items in the registers of different accounts, it will say &#34;Quicken has stopped responding&#34; or crashed and needs to close. Restarting the program brings it back up until the next hiccup shuts it down.<br /><br />The only fix I was able to find online was to hide the check number column in the register but that provided no help for me. I've downloaded the latest fix, which seems to have slowed the crashes but they still occur during each session and now I have one new glitch -- once it opens, it doesn't display the contents of the register screen or menus unless I view it in a smaller window (i.e., not maximized).<br /><br />Sure hope they get it fixed soon - this is like driving a car that stops on you 5 times each trip you take. Still gets you there but not instilling much confidence and wishing you could trade it for something dependable."
0,"Make sure you understand how Rosetta Stone packages their products before you buy this or any other Rosetta Stone language product.<br /><br />If you buy one of their items such as this, Level 1 only, and you later decide you want to add more levels, there’s no way to upgrade or add those levels. You have to buy another package that includes Level 1. It’s outrageous really."
1,"I started out with Aperture 3 for Mac but over time became aware that most photographers I personally know, edit with Adobe products. After giving Lightroom 5 a try, I find the overall finished result superior to Aperture 3 in most aspects.<br /><br />When it comes to removing blemished from portraits, Aperture 3 has the upper hand. Removing facial blemishes with Lightroom 5 leaves a visible marking at every location where healing was used, sometimes leaving no access to heal a blemish that is nearby. It sometimes makes for difficulty in using spot removal on a portrait of a person without perfect skin. Other than this one gripe, Lightroom gives me an overall more polished final image.<br /><br />Aperture 3 has the better user interface. It's easier on the eyes and easier to navigate than Lightroom 5. Lightroom 5 reminds me of reading DOS but you get used to it over a short period of time."
0,"If you used H&R Block last year and want to import last year's info, DO NOT BUY THIS. The import PDF function doesn't work."
0,"Never have been able to retrieve. Not showing in cloud or device and when I download again, it says already purchased. Looks entertaining but after 2 months have given up."
1,Everything was great except it failed to download one of the investment accounts. Had to manually input the 1099 div.
1,QuickBooks Pro has saved me a lot of time with gathering clients receipts and deposits.  Once information is entered I am able to create accurate financial statements.  It is user friendly also.
1,"Better than MacAfee, Avira, or any others,  I have tried them all.  It doesn't slow down my computer and is very efficient."
0,"Have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years and loved it.  No more.  The bait and switch was bad enough,  the promise of free upgrade by CEO is also a lie.  Bought, downloaded and installed Deluxe before knowing changes.  Imported data from 2013 return.  When saw needed forms missing, saw promise by CEO that free upgrade to Premium was available within program...starting in Feb.  So clicked on upgrade within program...Guess what?  Upgrade to Premium is NOT free, TT wants $30 to upgrade.  So free upgrade promise for returning customers was a lie.  But wait...TT is also offering $25 rebate if you purchase Premium.  But if it costs me $30 to upgrade, then get $25 rebate...it still cost me $5.  So promise of free upgrade is still a lie.  TT says it knew of mess and fixed it back in Feb, so there is no excuse for it still being problem in April.  Congrats CEO and senior staff...you have just destroyed your company."
1,"I have been using Human Japanese for a little bit over 2 weeks, and so far the experience has been terrific!  This programs teach you Japanese in \\""baby steps\\"" like manner. The explanations from each lesson are very easy to understand and follow. At first I thought this program is going to be like of those boring textbooks that you get in school, but instead it is actually pretty fun and engaging; definitely will not stress you out or put you to sleep. It's like having your own private friendly tutor teaching you Japanese.       As of now (7/20/2011) I have memorized all Hiragana characters, and 5 Katakana characters (The first 6 chapters out of 40ch). Those characters are fun to learn. It was like a big accomplishment for me after I learned all Hiragana characters.  I plan to learn further after I completed the first Human Japanese series; Looking forward to the Intermediate Human Japanese. Japanese will be my third language, whereas English is my second language. In my opinion it was not that hard to start learning Japanese. Therefore I am confident anyone who's interested in learning Japanese for the first time will be happy with the Human Japanese Software."
1,I wasnt sure I always used another one and kept on getting viruses till i switch and<br />havent had a problem yet also keeps all of my wiireless safe online
1,I have only used the product for five months but feel it provides good protection. I have had no problems.
0,"As of 2/2/15, the QB website falsely shows that Enhanced Payroll is billed at $369 annually, see here:[...]  I have the QB base version of enhanced payroll for one employee and just received a renewal notice for $414, as priced here on Amazon. I've used QB for over 12 years. The base version I had in 2013 covered 3 employees, then they reduced it in 2014 to 1 employee with additional fees per additional employee but didn't lower the price i. e. less product for the same price. This year 2015, they've raised the base Enhanced Payroll renewal rate by over 10%. QB/Intuit, PLEASE stop taking advtg of your loyal small business customers to unreasonably increase your pricing/revenue at our expense."
0,I would not recommend this to anyone.  Even though I purchased two extras they recommended.  It still did not work!
1,"I used TT for years, but after reading reviews on how TT raised the cost and decreased the features I decide to give HRB a try. Although the the layout was a bit different, it was easy enough to navigate and understand. My filing status and deductions were about the same as last year and my refund was about the same too. For the money, HRB was worth the switch."
1,"Update 2/6/2015 - I was able to upgrade to Premier for free.  Just click on the upgrade in the menu of the main program... instead of paying xxx$, it is free....     Ok, Intuit has corrected their error.  Call 1-800-445-1875 to find out about the FREE upgrade to the Premier version from this Deluxe version.    I originally bought the HRBlock product only to find that their handling off the NJ State taxes had issues.  When I explained the issue to them, the just pushed me off to 'talk to a tax advisor' - sorry I will not pay a fee for Block's faulty software.  The cs rep just ended the chat.    So, I reentered my data into TurboTax.  It was a breeze.  And, not having issues with my returns just made me happy again.    I will say the I liked the walk through of the questions much better on TTax than on HRB.  Visually, the screens are also 'softer/cleaner\\""."
1,"I work for a non-profit and we've tried a couple of different programs for accounting and they've all been nightmares.  It's been difficult to find a software that allows us to track individual donors easily.  I was having to use two different programs: one that tracked the individual donors and another for writing checks and creating monthly financial reports, etc.  QuickBooks Online Plus can do everything I need.  I love that I can use it on my work laptop from home or my desktop at the office.  It's very intuitive and easy to use.  I couldn't be happier!"
1,I love it. It works automatically and is so much better than the free software. I highly recommend it to any non IOS7 users.
1,I've been using TurboTax for over a decade now and can't complain. It's very thorough and the interview questions make it easy to account for all income received and credits that I can claim. Always recommend it to others and will continue to use in the future.
0,I have a Windows 8.1 PC and this is not working.
1,This antivirus works great and is free! I've had it for years and had no problems at all.<br />Great service!
0,"I always loved MSMoney and only reason I dumped it is because Microsoft did. No upgrades or service to it. Quicken 2010 was a big disappointment to me but seemed to be my only option. I've gotten somewhat used to it so the upgrade to 2013 was OK but still not a very user friendly product. Does the job, though."
1,it is a good game it was exactly what I expected .. for those who are interested I recommend this game
1,Very good deal. Thanks
1,"Since installing Avast, I have not had any problems, the many messages that pop up in the corner can be annoying."
0,I do not like this software:<br /><br />- It could not retrieve my 2008 return<br />- The stock sales are confusing and unclear<br />- Scary : they knew my health history. Where did they get this info and how?<br />  I am very disturbed.<br /><br />Stay clear and use an accountant.
1,This worked great and the Amazon rebate made it pay for itself.
0,"Made me buy Premier version at extra cost because I had 1 stock sale.  Intuit got so much bad press that they backtracked.  But instead of refunding the entire price, they are giving me a rebate that I need to fill out after I file my return.  Shame on Intuit"
1,Works as expected!  I have enjoyed Norton's products.
1,"great software, no bloat.  unlike several other security suites i tried, this doesn't slow anything down behind the scenes, small footprint."
1,struggled to get the updated version on all my  computers since it was significantly cheaper to buy this than to upgrade on my 3 PCs... come on Symantec... helpa brutha out... just give me the darned ability to update for the same price.
0,lacks proper support. made several errors in rental income and expense report.
0,I like my 97 version more.  Better data input screen.  Your invoice will not look like the printed version and the text boxes are too small and not customizable.  Think about upgrading to the 2010 version instead.
1,"I've used others, but this is the best for the best price. I always get the Home Premium because I have a rental house and stocks. The software is very simple to just follow thru the screens answering all the questions on each subject. I cannot comment on the Business part of the software since I only bought this combo pack of Home Premium and Business this time since it was on sale cheaper than the Home Premium alone. But I can say the Home Premium is very in depth yet easy to use. I handles my stocks, my rental house, IRAs, bond sales, college deductions and everything else I can through at it from an American family."
1,Turbo Tax is always great. Buy it every year. Amazon had it for a great price in 2012 and I bought it. Used the download option and had zero issues. I would recommend this product and download method to everyone.
1,"Purchased and installed on the 1st of October 2014. The install was from a CD, which was installed in about ten minutes. The install was done without any problem, and the data file conversion was completed without errors or problems. I also download the Quicken App for my iPad Air. I have now been using both the laptop and iPad Air app without any problems. I use both programs daily and never run into any of the problems I have seen posted. I am a twenty year user of Quicken Premier, and will continue using Quicken as it is a very good financial program."
1,"This is a very interesting program if you like to do creative PowerPoint-like presentations and have control over how to display and animate images. It gives you many different and fun ways to animate text (and at different speeds). And you can import PowerPoint into the program.The downside is the product is made in Germany and the advanced tutorials are in German. Once you become familiar with the features and if you have a good intuitive sense with slideshow programs, you can follow along with the tutorials. I watch them with the sound turned down. As a slideshow program for images, it's not as robust or feature-rich as the Photodex products, such as Pro Show Producer. However, you can do a lot of interesting things with Aquasoft Slideshow 8 Ultimate. The interface is simple to use. It allows you to divide each section of your presentation into chapters for greater control. It comes with many animated templates for images and text. You can control and select your in fade-in and fade-out animations and it has many image filter and text effects. The &#34;ultimate&#34; version gives you full output functionality. You can output your show in may different format. The video format selections are outstanding. The resolution is fantastic. You can upload directly to YouTube. You can add background music and sound effects to different sections. The web outputs are very basic (almost too basic to use). With the basic version of this program, you cannot output to different file formats but you can upload the YouTube. I started with the basic version which I got free from Amazon. Then I upgraded to the ultimate version. For the price, I would really recommend this program. The only reason I'm not giving this product 5 stars is because the advanced tutorials are not in English. Tech support gets back to you within 24 hours. I'm having a lot of fun with this program. Go for it!"
1,"BETTER THAN NOTHING, DOES NOT HAVE THE EASY USE OF THE VERSIONS FOR MICROSOFT PRODUCTS BUT IT WORKS."
0,"Crippled Software!!!!!! Shame on you TurboTax!!!<br /><br />This year's Deluxe and Premier versions are crippled. We would have to buy the Home and Small Business Edition for $50 more. They are useless for those of us who have a small business and stock investments.<br /><br />After almost 20 years of using TurboTax, I just bought H and R Block Deluxe for $29.99 via download from Amazon. It is not crippled and has everything last year's TT Deluxe had and installed/imported perfectly. All my gains/losses are there as well as all the depreciation information from my business. It has five Federal eFiles and includes one state return.<br /><br />Intuit;  Just what the heck is wrong with you people?"
1,"I haven't had a lot of opportunity to use it that much yet, but from what I have done with it, I think it will be just what I wanted and needed.  I used to use Adobe Photoshop many years ago and I was able to do a lot with it.  I'm hoping that this new program will be as easy for me to learn and use as the last one I had."
1,Turbo tax reveloutionized the tax preparing madness years ago and has been my staple ever since.  I wouldn't even try to do taxes without it.
1,"The download was quick and easy and I've had no problems with using the Word program.  I haven't used anything else in the Office Suite, since I was only interested in Word."
0,Don't believe the free fed and State e-filing claim.  Not very upfront with what you need to purchase to get this.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I believe this will be my last.
0,"Man, do I miss Microsoft Office products from 1997.  LOL.  Remember when you bought a disc, installed it on your PC's, and created documents?  Remember when Microsoft had no idea when and where you were creating those documents?  Remember when it never tried to upload personal ideas and information to a cloud?  Yeah.  Those were the days.<br /><br />This product is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.  It has been needlessly tinkered with and jumbled so that Microsoft can charge more money for a newer &#34;version.&#34;  It is THE SAME OLD STUFF WE HAVE ALWAYS PURCHASED!  Just because you add trifling features and hide the location of buttons every year does not justify robbery of your customers.<br /><br />Just because my laptop broke, I am chained to buying this version.  A slave to an overpriced--if not inferior--product because I NEED it for work.<br /><br />If you can, AVOID it.  If you're stuck, well, this does function like every other Office version.  It does what it does well.  Cannot deny that."
1,I use the free version for home computers and love it.  Much better and more user friendly than the competition.
0,"Unable to access the downloaded file on my computer.  There's a popup that states &#34;Finding Download...&#34; and &#34;Saving To...&#34; , but the software doesn't open.  Total waste of money.  Will have to repurchase a disc from a brick and mortar store."
0,"It was different than it was last year, took more time to get it done correctly."
0,"Like the software, don't like the price or the fact I just got version 6 and one week later 7 came out."
1,"I've used sketchbook on my ipad with wonderful results.  I tried using photoshop on my computer with my Genie art pad and wasn't happy.  I figured sketchbook pro 6 would be more for artist than photoshop and I was right.  I was able to do a wonderful portrait of my Goldendoodle that is stunning if I say so myself.  Wish I could share. Whether you work in anime or are a find artist like myself, you'll be very pleased with the ease of creating with the sketchbook pro6 software."
0,"Maybe this is meant for beginners.  I don't like it because so many of the features are automated without the ability to customize or adjust to your own specifications.  I much prefer Serif X5.  While Serif is definitely more complicated to use, you have a lot more freedom to make adjustments that fit film makers individual specifications and requirements."
1,Had a problem with filing state taxes I.e. a 3 week delay.
1,My daughter likes this program a lot and with regular practice she has been constantly improving her typing speed. This program is highly recommended.
0,"This product did not work at all for me. As far as I'm concerned it's completely useless. I'd like my money back. Fortunately, it didn't cost too much."
1,"I've done my taxes past four years with turbo tax. This was the first year that I am having problems with the software. We did our taxes before our states paperwork was done. So when we print it off it says do not file. We have waited for the date to pass from the website. Still no luck, called customer service that told me state files would be ready on the following Monday. He set me up with a free download of priemer. So Monday came there was no update. So I uninstalled my cd copy and installed the priemer costumer service sent me through email. It wanted me to purchase my state files. So long story short still no state file done."
0,"Only had it for a short time... to soon to say but so far working good! Unfortunately, my partner has had big problems with his avast! We have the same antivirus but his was penetrated with some bad virus and his antivirus didn't protect him. He has had his longer.... On well, time will say!"
0,"Well, I had read reviews here and elsewhere so I know it was going to be bad.  Unfortunately, Intuit updated my existing Q2009 product to withdraw online banking in order to force us all to upgrade.  Well, it worked on me since I didn't want to manually download and import transactions.  So, I now have Q2012.  I've got an online account for which I've changed the password.  The account is not in the password vault though it is trying to update (and gets an error).  Trying to deactivate the account hangs Q2012 and I have to kill it with task manager.  I've spent 1.5 hours with chat support with them figuring out that what I described here is accurate.  They then turned me over to online banking \\""support\\"" who I've now gone several useless rounds with.  First they asked me for logs.  Then they asked me to do what's in a KB entry that is specific to *their* disconnecting the link to *USAA* (not my bank).  I asked them what they expected me to do with that entry.  They responded, oh, yeah well then we suggest you deactivate the account - which, of course my inability to do was the source of the original problem report."
0,old one is better
1,A really cool program with lots of support!!! AWAESOME!!!
1,"I have been using this brand for 3 years and really protects my computer, I trust it.  I also complemented this antivirus with  Iobit -Advance systems care- a pc cleaner- no problem.f bugs-free and virus.-free"
0,"First be sure to read the system requirements. you need  Service pack 3 if you still use Microsoft XP. I have Professional on my desk top and the home version on my laptop. I could never get service pack 3 to load on my desktop pc even with the help of a friend that teaches Microsoft. Microsoft are you listening, your OS system stinks. Work on it!!  LISTEN to the PEOPLE!! A little service would be nice. You also need Microsoft NET frame 4.0.<br />  I did get it to  load with the home version on my laptop. Then I tried to load Turbo Tax. It loaded on my laptop but then when I tried to open it for the first time it would not open an gave me an error message. I tried several times and got the same error message every time. I tried to do some research on the error message and could find nothing. Turbo Taxes support was to email them and wait. It also generated a error report, but that does not help me. I never did get any support and ended up having to do my taxes the old fashion way. hard copy with form downloads from the IRS website. No refund is possible from Amazon as it was software and a direct download . END result : Wasted MONEY!!<br /><br />My advice: Make sure you read before you buy and make sure your computer can handle it. Have plenty of time for research and fixes just in case. It's a very hard program to load. I have read other reviews so I know I'm not the only one with issues about the quality of this software.<br />Intuit : Take the time to listen to your consumers and improve your product before next  year."
0,Absolutely tried EVERYTHING! I have been trying to download this since I bought it 2 months ago ... The program is obviously NOT compatible with windows 8 as it says!!!! How do I get a refund?!?!?!
1,"I've been using Quicken since it was a DOS product.  I like it for budget management and cash flow.  It also helps me track my stocks and bonds and maintain cost basis information for tax purposes.<br /><br />I like the download feature to be able to download my credit cards and bank account information.  But once a month, when I try to download from Bank of America, after they pay interest, the account won't down load, and I have to enter that day's cleared items manually.  Don't know what causes that problem, but it's been there for at least the last three years.<br /><br />Also, starting to get a lot of popup ads from intuit wanting me to upgrade or purchase another new product.  I hope they don't make the same dumb mistake TubroTax did with a forced upgrade and increased cost.<br /><br />Overall, still a good product, best on the market."
0,"I have been using Quicken for about 15 years. I have the new 2015 property management system which is totally screwed up. Trying to get in touch with Quicken is Like trying to talk to Putin. What you can find is nothing but goobledegook which does not cover the topic nor solves the problem..There is no way to provide feedback all those avenues are discontinued. My transactions are not downloading properly which tells me that this whole thing is now unreliable, untrustworthy and hopeless."
1,Been using this product for several years now and it always does the job. I would recommend it product to anyone.
0,"but I found other e-file options to work better for my needs at the same cost.  For those not accustomed to doing their own taxes on a regular basis, this might be a good option."
0,"I have had nothing but praise for PaintShopPro when the software was still owned by JASC. I finally upgraded to Corel PSP-X3 a short while ago to use for a project and I found it to be a buggy mix of ill-conceived, ill-designed features that somewhat mimic Photoshop without the performance and intuitive GUI.<br /><br />PSP-X3 has an effects browser that does not undo the filters you browse when working, which could be catastrophic in a money-making task-- both from the perspective of lost time and possible destruction of original materials. I am glad that I never used the organizer feature, I don't know what might have happened to my files had I let that software fondle them.<br /><br />The compression settings for jpg files would not stay where I put them, without compression, so, I had to set them for every \\""save\\"" situation. Because of this, you should never use auto-save features on Corel PSP. The old JASC version never had these issues.<br /><br />I uninstalled this junk. Sadly, I wasted my money on it, but, never again will I ever contemplate buying anything from Corel.<br /><br />I wish there was an option for negative stars in this rating system."
1,Downloaded it on line - worked straight away with no problems...would recommend it
1,I have used TurboTax for 20 plus years with the exception of 2006. Then I tried HR Block and immediately decided to ggo back to TurboTax. The ease of use and thoroughness are the main reasons. Also a great positive is the State return. TurboTax makes it seamless in filing that return. My refund came in 12 days from the Feds.
0,EXPIRED within 4 days of purchase and sets you up for RENEWAL without being able to change it. Need I say more???
0,"As a CPA and someone who enjoys managing their money I was looking forward to moving my preferred method of tracking my accounts from excel to Quicken.  I could not be more disappointed.  As a former user of Mint.com I had hoped to have the same functionality, plus better investment tracking.  You would think that with Quicken owning Mint having at least equivalent functionality would seem logical, but apparently not.  I had hoped to be able to update all of my accounts by pressing a button within Quicken, but many online banks such as ING and Ally do not support this functionality.  As a result, I still have to go to these sites to download each account individually.  I have tried 4 separate times to import my 401 along with my wife's.  We have a 401k from the same employer and even though I mark the acount as my spouse's during setup, it always imports into my account.  These are just two examples.  Additionally, any help you try to receive is via e-mail with no possibility of getting someone on the phone.  I could keep going on but I think my message is already clear.  I urge any reader of this not to purchase Quicken.  Please do not waste your money.  If I were an employee of the company I would be totally ashamed of this abomination."
1,"Title says it all - Did what I needed and the online/phone support was very helpful.  Would recommend.  Have always liked TaxCut better than Turbo Tax (However, have not tried Turbo Tax since 2007)."
0,"This is the last time I buy H&R via amazon, I had a hard time today to fill my taxes because it failed the installed program I did weeks ago.<br /><br />On top of it, Amazon dares to charge higher than H&R"
1,Easy to download and less expensive than purchasing a CD. Did what I expected.I will continue to use Turbo Tax.
0,"I signed up for the Small Business Premium for nonprofits version. I should have read the reviews before making that decision. Passwords were continuously rejected and instructions were incomplete. Original agreement said the subscription was monthly and I could cancel at any time. I got to fed up I tried to cancel the day after I signed up. Once I found the place to enter the cancellation I learned that I had a one year commitment. When I tried to cancel it said I could not cancel an assigned subscription. It is assigned to me. So I looked in vain for a way to un-assign. The one thing that it seemed to accept was my order to cancel the auto-renewal scheduled August 25, 2015. Fortunately the nonprofit fee for one year for one subscription is only $24. The real pain is the hours of time I wasted trying to navigate the system in the midst of continuous password resets."
1,I didn't get audited!
1,I am so glad everything was able to be transfered from my old Quicken!
0,Disappointed by TurboTax Deluxe this year.  They changed the levels so that many of the benefits from Deluxe had to be bought in the higher versions.  I switched to HRB.  TurboTax (Intuit) just lost a customer...and i'd been using them since I graduated from college!  Ouch!
0,"This version is a BIG step backward from past versions.  It messed up the budgeting tool, past reports, and PDF printing.  It doesn't provide the budget reports properly without adjusting the budget. The PDF printing keeps making the application hang requiring a Ctrl-Alt-Del to exit the task and restart with database corruption.  Win 7, Quicken Home & Biz 2015."
1,AWESOME AS ORDERED!
0,"I am a CPA so I compare the various tax software offerings for ease of use. I had never used H&R Block so I thought I would give it a try. I started by importing a prior year return done in Turbo tax. I completed the information on a simple return but it did not give the $400 work credit. I had done the same return in Turbo tax and it gave the credit. The Block software did not tell me why it did not give the credit. After fumbling around, I finally figured out it did not import the social security number. That should have generated a warning message from the start. My rule of thumb for software is if it cannot do the simple stuff, it certainly won't do the complex stuff."
1,"I have had Avast! Free Antivirus for two years with no problems, so can't say anything but good things.  It has caught some potential viruses."
1,Great software. Works better than most paid versions. I love the fact that you can get great software without paying for it. I'm on a tight budget and it's good to know that companies provide Free software to those who need it.!!!
1,"Had no problem downloading the TurboTax Home and Business Federal software.  On completing the installation, any available upgrades, and my profile from TurboTax 2011: I downloaded a state tax software.  No problem downloading the state.  This is on a Windows 8 PC."
0,Don't Buy!! When I purchased it said E-File Federal and ONE STATE. When trying to file TT said I need to PAY $19.99 MORE!! to E-File State.
1,Only purchased because it was needed for work.  The seller was great.  It was easy to understand how to download upon completing purchase.
0,finding proper forms to complicated
1,I purchased this product and I'am well happy with it. However checking your e-mails I noticed  that the product price was reduced. It would be nice to receive the new price that would make a 5 star  item.                                                                    Lrope
1,"Easy to download.  Easy to use.  And, much cheaper than going to a tax service.  So far, it seems that the end result will be comparable to using a tax service and we will have much more insight into how the numbers worked out as they did."

0,"I bought this on-line code for a lifetime update for my nuvi 260W.  Did all the administrative stuff (updating software on unit, restarting nuvi 260W) but when attempting to download maps using the code from Amazon, Garmin says I have already used my code and refuses to update maps.  In fact, it steers me to their site to purchase the lifetime map upgrade again.  I sent an email to Garmin, but, if like in the past, I will never get a response.  For some people, this code works like a charm and they are happy.  I am a long-time Amazon customer (over 50 purchases) and I am disappointed with Amazon as well as with Garmin this time.  It may work for you, but, it DID NOT WORK for me.  I was torn between buying a new unit or a lifetime update.  I should have bought the new unit from Costco at about 70% more money than I paid Amazon.  I made a very bad decision.  My loss!!"
0,"Very disappointing, it lacks some basic financial/investment features and Quicken tries to charge for ways to provide some of them in an attempt to match the Windows version. I'm not sure why they're selling such an incomplete version. Suggest finding other services."
1,Very good detection rate while maintaining low false positives. I have tried other AV scanners but none have managed this combination as well as avast. Keep it up.
1,"Have been using Quicken for several years, they keep improving all the time. It is getting a little  more expensive."
1,"I've had numerous versions of Quicken over the years from pro to QuickBooks. My life is simple now, this is simple so it's great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there was more control of the appearance. But the feature allowing you to download bank transactions is working lots better than my last version (09)."
0,"To Bob Meighan, Intuit VP:<br />As everyone else has commented, Intuit has ruined TurboTax (TT) and lost me as a TT customer. I'm looking at eight past years of TT but no more. Regardless of how you put it, Intuit has lost many customers and badly hurt its reputation. Here is what Warren Buffet of Berkshire-Hathaway said publicly in his annual letter to his managers, “The top priority–trumping everything else, including profits–is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be perfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose money – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.”  Intuit has &#34;shredded&#34; its reputation. It will be very hard to get us customers to return or trust Intuit. Will this same thing happen to Quicken which I have used for years? Intuit needs to &#34;seize the moment&#34; and change back to its old software/pricing model, giving everyone an up grade at no cost without making a call to customer service. What say you Bob Meighan? Can you rescue Intuit's reputation?"
1,Does a good job and easy to use.
1,This update to Quicken for Mac helps me to keep all of my finances in one place and is the perfect blend of my planned expenses and downloading the transactions from the bank.  Quicken helps me stay on top of what's happening and plan for the future. I just had that I'm forced to update every few years.
0,"This product expires, or at least turns into a Freemium scam.  They don't tell you that but it does. I bought version 3 about 6 years ago, in the mall for over $500. At the time I had a trip to France planned out. I took it home and activated it. Flash forward to this year. We are thinking about going to France again. In the intervening years we have had to uninstall and reinstall the program. Now the activation code won't work and when I called the support desk I am told they no longer support my product and can't help me. If I want help I can try upgrading my set, however that has a fee of $15 A MONTH. I don't want a subscription, so my $500 investment is essentially useless. I was never told this product expires before I bought it, I certainly would not have bought it if I'd known."
1,Backup data and windows on my manager system .
0,Extra fees are unreasonable and unexpected.  You are better off using free alternatives.
0,I am pleased with the Avast security and am hopeful that Avast will continue to keep us safe.  I had a different (very public) product and it was always in conflict with my computer.  Thanks to Avast for doing a great job!<br /><br />Keep up the good work!
1,"Worked well for my 2012 taxes. I didn't notice any glitches. Some information could have been a bit more detailed, but this was in tax areas that the average American taxpayer is unlikely to encounter, like foreign taxes paid.<br />The website clearly states that state e-file costs extra, so no one should be surprised - just read the product description."
0,"I purchased this because I have been a long-time Norton user. After buying it, I tried to get it to install to my Kindle tablet. I kept being shunted to the Google Play store where it kept trying to charge me again. I even had the Tech guys from Kindle Support walk me through it, but they couldn't get it to work, either. They ended up just refunding my money. If I could give it less than one star, I would."

So I have not used the program yet, BUT from what I have seen it looks really cool."

0,Very helpful
1,Never had a problem with Avast! Good quality.

1,"After the initial bad reviews for Quicken 2013 and it's cloud component I waited until Intuit got it fixed.  Well, they sure fixed it.  I am using the Cloud connection between Quicken on my PC and cell phone much more than I thought I would.  Now I can enter Quicken data on the fly using my iPhone mobile app.  With a click at home it syncs with my PC Quicken.  Wow!  Don't know that Quicken 2013 is that much better than Quicken 2012 otherwise but the upgrade is a must if you want the mobile app!"
0,"This was marketed as a contact management software, but when you buy it, you have to subscribe to monthly fee services.  I can't even go in and add contacts individually.  Don't buy this product.  It is a scam.  and you can't get a refund."

0,I've had this product before and it works fine for me.  I wanted to install it on an old XP computer but the download wouldn't work for it.  I wish I had bought the version with the CD.
0,Maybe the product is good....but when it will not even load on my computer I cant really say.  Very upset there is no option for tech support.  Windows 8 just keeps telling me the program has stopped working every time I open it. Ahhh!!
0,"I purchased this product directly from the website. I have been a very loyal intuit customer for many years. this product has almost ruined my life. First, when doing 2013 taxes, it corupted or lost several months of work, that I had to put back manually. It stops downloading from banks all the time. It doesn't back up. I have three accounts (have had these same three for many years) when I want to change accounts, it can't find it. when I locate the back up that I placed on my desktop, the program wants to &#34;reinstall&#34; quicken. what's that all about? Right now I need to do estimated taxes, and cannot find an account. no where to be found. this is the worst product ever.also, absolutely NO support. you have to pay to talk to a foreigner read out of a book. I am toooooo old to fight with this. will do it by hand. Never buying a product from this company again. this is the only place I can voice my frustration. I am near tears at the thought of all the work I have to get done today."

1,I use this program for redesigning rooms that I remodel and send pictures to the owners to give them ideas as to what the room could look like when it's finished.  It has really helped me tremendously with the upgrades and getting approvals from owners.
1,"Always easy, step by step."
0,"Yes, the government should provide this software free. Hiring some software engineers should have been part of the \\""bailout.\\"" That aside, do not be mislead by the OS requirements listed for this software download on Amazon. It is windows only. It suggests that under the product name, but when you click on the \\""system requirements\\"" link it lists Mac OS 10 etc. The software certainly exists for Mac, but not for download on Amazon. The downloader needed just to download the software is windows only. Mac users can head for the back of the Amazon bus. Well, actually they can't even get on this bus.  The software is actually ok, other than the price. I will just have to get it elsewhere."
1,"It's a great product, lots of innovative tools and processes, easy to use. After using Aperture for several years, easy to see some simple &#34;fixes&#34; that would make it even easier/better, but that's competition, right? Aperture now history, so have to deal with the little annoyances. I figure soon enough I'll forget the good stuff of Aperture and get lost in LR."
0,"This is junk software.  Tried first on my PC then on my laptop.  Received a message on laptop that I was locked out until 12/18/14. No where on Amazon did it say that I could not use this on more then one computer.<br />Based on how this software performed in identifying problems on my computer,the lockout is probably a good thing.  It will teach me not to purchase anything from this company again."
0,"Turbo Tax approved that they are the worst sneaky services. You buy this thing online and download it to your desktop. After finishing everything it asks you for extra 40 dollars to do the state tax.!!! then you have to pay and now we are 80 bucks. Then you want to file online, cool smart guy, they ask you for 20 bucks more. !!! what is that ??!!!  sneaky like someone steals my money dollar by dollar.<br /><br />I will never use this fraud program. Very bad."
0,"Very difficult to install, took quite a while.  Also, it seems as if it stops working about a month before it expires.  This is the second year I've seen it do this.  Will have consider using something other than this product next time!!"
1,Price was good and download went smooth. Package is one I buy every year for personal use. Easy to use
1,MoneyDance is an excellent system that meets my needs and more. Since moving from MS Money I have been looking for a suitable replacement that has an iPad app. After several attempts I saw MoneyDance on a review site and downloaded the free trial and was instantly hooked. The support is excellent too.

0,"I have a fairly decent PC (quad core 2.6 GHz with plenty of RAM) and this program failed to produce any watchable files. No matter what output options I selected, the result was always choppy and the audio was about half a second off. Just enough to drive me crazy. Other free software performs better. Purchase at your own risk.  Update: I've found that the combo of MakeMKV and Handbrake works extremely well on Windows. MakeMKV is free for DVD use and $50 for BluRay conversion. Handbrake is entirely free. The combo of these two programs has enabled me to digitize my entire library. So much more worth the cost than this &#34;magical&#34; junk."
1,"I've been using Turbotax since 1991. I actually enjoy using it. If a neophyte, the step by step feature leads you thru it. Or, go straight to forms."
1,"This is a very easy and powerful tool to convert videos and make them ready to upload to sites like YouTube and Vimeo. If your computer has an Intel processor that is pretty new, it uses hardware acceleration which makes conversions lightning fast.  A couple of annoyances.<br />1.  The first thing the  program did when it launched was to tell me there's a newer version that I can buy for another $39.95!  WTF! I just paid that for this version and it's already obsolete!!.<br />2. Every time I exit it advertises other products from this company.  C'mon, I paid retail for this, why do I have to be subjected to their ads???<br /><br />8/30/14 update: Regarding #2, the ads can be turned off with a little check box on the ad. It didn't work the first time, but did the second.  I'm finding this utility to be FANTASTIC, even if it's now obsolete.  Conversions are lightning fast and the learning curve has been quick and easy."
0,"Where do I begin? The list is long.  Outlook stands out as the wart on the bull's butt in this Office Suite. Why the Microsoft Team didn't make Mac Outlook seemingly identical to the PC version is beyond me.<br /><br />First of all, I have a recent MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM.  Taking machine performance off the table, let's take a look at the most annoying of Mac Outlook's issues:<br /><br />1) Why there are two Outlook file formats for the Outlook data file simply adds to the confusion.  On the PC, it is the \\""psd.\\""  On the Mac, it is the \\""olm.\\"" You would think consistency would be order.  Try conversion processes and you may find your data compromised.<br /><br />2) Watch your Mac Outlook database grow and the problems become apparent.  Mac Outlook was never meant for enterprise data handling.  I have a folder with 150,000 files in it and Mac Outlook cannot search this. My attempts to make the folder smaller were fruitless. That rainbow pin wheel of death will be bring the killer out in you.<br /><br />3) There is no auto-archive.  On the PC version, there is.  Why not the Mac version? This forces you to create more folders to house new files.  The more folders you have in Mac Outlook, the performance simply dumps.<br /><br />4) Have a boatload of contacts?  I have over 50,000.  Again, Mac Outlook craps out. Again, rainbow pin wheel of death will torture you here when you try to search.<br /><br />5) I am finding that I have to rebuild the Mac Outlook database frequently has it becomes corrupt often.<br /><br />6) Setting up a POP connection?  Not like the PC version where you test the connection to see if it works.<br /><br />7) As your database grows, retrieving emails becomes a hassle....very slow.<br /><br />8) I am big on rules to sort incoming mail.  From time to time, Mac Outlook will ignore the rules and re-route email to different folders.<br /><br />9) Mac Outlook is horrible resource hog.  It will lock up other applications while you struggle to do a search within it.<br /><br />10) Forgot doing any work within Outlook while Mac Outlook retrieves or sends email.  This is particularly true if you have a boatload of rules.  A Finder search?  Difficult while Outlook is running a mail send or retrieval.<br /><br />Bottom Line: We can't wait to get off Mac Outlook as our productivity has sunk to an all-time low using it."

0,"I gave PowerDVD 13 Deluxe 2 stars because of disappointment. I purchased a new PC HP Envy h8-1534,AMD 6 core FX6200,10 GB Ram,AMD Radeon HD 7570 graphics, Windows8. Software bundle Cyberlink Media suite 10 with PowerDVD10. Nothing but problems trying to play dvd's. I contacted HP, I contacted Cyberlink (still waiting for response) and no relief. Problem dvd skipping and freezing no matter how I cleaned it, ran a CD/DVD drive cleaner, uninstalled twice and reinstalled even did the extreme did a system recovery and dvd playback was poor. Since I am past the return point for the PC my last straw was to upgrade the dvd software to PowerDVD 13 hoping the upgrade would solve the issue so I could enjoy my library of DVD's. Answer after download, is Not! Audio doesn't sound like a skipping stone now, but the video freezes a lot during playback and I have to stop the movie to let it reset, resume, screen goes blank for a second or so then the movie continues. Movies watched Avatar, Star Wars I,II,III, to name a few. Video quality is very good however is the reason I gave a 2. Not Amazon's fault the download and install was very easy, Cyberlink's product is not as advertised. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry Amazon."

If I were not busy with starting the business I would be more on top of it."

1,"As a Quicken for Mac user since 1996, I was frustrated by having to use only Quicken Essentials, but stuck with it and eventually found it simple and easy to use for the limited range of functions it enabled. Now that Quicken 2015 has arrived, I am happy to have a wider range of functions return, and the addition of the ability to include mobile devices, iOS as well as Android, is a big plus. However, I am somewhat disappointed in the additional complexity that has been introduced in some of the routine functions."
0,"I've been a happy Quicken user since 2000, and I've frequently upgraded.  I'm guessing I've now had 8 different Quicken versions over this time.    I'm a heavy user, with lots of transactions and accounts, and I'm also a member of Quicken's Inner Circle.    I'm sad to report that this year's Q2012 Premier is the worst version I've encountered.    I've been victim to countless crashes, inexplicable endless hangs, problems with accepting downloaded transactions, etc.  At least one of this year's \\""updates\\"" has made things even worse (in Accepting Downloaded Transactions).    All of this has been a great surprise and disappointment because until this version I've been a big fan.    At first I wondered if perhaps I might've recently exceeded a Quicken capacity limit, but the Quicken URL that mentions this ([...]) states \\""Transactions, reports, and graphs - As many as allowed by the size of your hard drive\\"".  I have a 1T hard drive that's under 10% full so the problem is not at my end.    I do plan to continue with Quicken since so far I can't find a similar alternative that can export data into a tax program, but from now on I will downgrade to Quicken Deluxe, and rely on my broker sites to handle my investment transactions."

0,"Service: Avoid this product. They automatically charged my account a full 90 dollars for the total security 2015, but they require access to your credit card or paypal acct  when you purchase the product.

We kindly inform you that the option for automatic renewal was present on the order page when you initially purchased the  Bitdefender Total Security (order #__________). When you've placed that order, this option was left enabled and consequently your license was now renewed automatically.

0,Program will not run on my Win 7 PC - removed and re-installed multiple times - disabled Anti-Virus etc - still did not run.  Not sure what the problem could be as I've has used HR Block software for years. Frustrated
0,This version caused me to stop direct connect with my bank. Too many problem to enumerate. So I enter my transactions to the bank manually. The other updates to credit card companies and stock quotes seem to work fine.
0,I only upgraded from Quicken 2010 for one reason: I wanted to be able to continue to download my credit card transactions and I was prevented from doing that in 2010. Any other improvements in 2013 are useless to me and my simplified needs. This might very well be my last time upgrading for that reason.
1,I purchased this software for my kids to use for scho. Since my computer is a little older I needed an MS Word version that would work withy version of Windows. I had an easier time finding the correct software on Amazon than I did on Microsoft!

0,"I purchased QuickBooks 2012 for my PC a little over a year ago. Since then I have swapped out my PC for a Mac. The license I purchase for around $180 just one year ago is not good anymore. To get QuickBooks on my Mac I need to spend another $180 for another license. I wasn't aware my license to use the QuickBooks software would not work across multiple platforms. I think this is really poor support for a product like this, especially in an age of multiple platforms -- Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, etc. I called Intuit customer service to see if they would be able to provide assistance, their recommendations were:<br />* Purchase QuickBooks 2014 for full price<br />* Install software so I can run Windows on my Mac<br />* Shop around at retail stores looking for a better price<br /><br />There was never any concern for the interruption in my business or my dissatisfaction with the product. The customer service only made my experience worse since they were not willing to work with me to find an acceptable solution.<br /><br />Overall I think QuickBooks is a great product, however, my first interaction with their customer service is enough to call it quits. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."
1,I have always used Turbo Tax for doing my taxes.  The download was priced right and worked flawlessly.

0,"Packaged Software - the bundle of programs is appropriate for me and my intended use.  In other words, I did not have to buy a bunch of garbage to get the handful of useful programs.<br /><br />Install - On DSL, it took exactly 40 minutes to move from checkout to fully installed.  Add perhaps 2 minutes to set up my Hotmail account in Outlook.<br /><br />Program Familiarity - The interface is generally common with office software that has been released in, say, the past 5 years.  I have only been using for an hour or so, but found no issues in understanding functionality.<br />In Outlook, I changed the appearance of panes, added folders, and set up dozens of filters in no time.<br />OneNote looks a bit different than my old version, but the basic structure is common (Notebook -&#62; Section -&#62; Page).  Annoyingly, a separate window opens with &#34;send to OneNote&#34; options ... I see no use for this.<br />I have only given a cursory glance at Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  My initial impression is that these are a slight evolution.<br /><br />SkyDrive - I have no interest in this.  It is built-into the various programs with varying degrees of annoyance.  You will find repeated requests to sign-in.<br /><br />Privacy - I absolutely dislike that a Live account is used to register/install.  I am not looking for my Office software to be linked to some personal experience.  It is software, not a socially-integrated lifestyle.  Back off Microsoft, there is no need for the worst of both worlds - mediocre software empire with all of the intrusion of Android-type Google spying.<br /><br />Summary - Yet another iteration of Microsoft software.  That means you get a decent amount of familiarity mixed with a couple of new features and fair amount of inexplicable annoyance.  If you made the mistake of buying Windows 8, then this will meet your expectations of Microsoft products."

0,"I am very sorry to see the loss of support for schedule D in the Deluxe edition. I've been using TurboTax every year since 1986. I'm afraid I've finally reached the breaking point and will have to switch products. From my standpoint, TurboTax has been slowly degrading its capability over the years. I know my issues don't affect everyone, but they do affect me:  The latest - loss of Schedule D (all the explanations are really B.S. It is just a price rise.)  Prices jumping significantly with no increase in functionality - especially in times of low inflation.  Earlier - loss of Schedule C (although I no longer use it every year)  Dumbing down the user interface. I used to primarily use Forms view when it gave all the built-in help when needed. Now you pretty much have to use the Q&A view to get help and it's not always immediately obvious what forms are being updated.  Much earlier - loss of ability to enter receipts for the following year as you got them and have them all picked up along with the previous year's tax return when you purchased the new version.    Update 12/29/14: OK, I admit to overreacting a bit. Most of that was the result of the \\""claim\\"" that this wasn't a price hike. I still like TurboTax and have usually rated in 5 stars. I still can't do that this year because of the price hike and the way it was handled. However, at least for this year, the offer of a free upgrade to Premium does cover the pain. So, I'm raising my review from 1 star to 3 stars. I know I'll have to buy Premium next year so I may be disappointed then, but I won't be unpleasantly surprised again. Price hikes do occur, and while I'm never happy, I understand that they do."

One can purchase one on one support. Its best to gather all your questions for your session.<br /><br />One change which I found confusing regards stock transactions. This year, you must specify what type of transaction occurred, i.e. box 1c or box 6. There was not clear explanation in the online help nor in the forums.<br /><br />H&R backs up their generated returns with audit support (untried). Buy the software."

1,"I've been using HR Block for the last several years, mainly because it provides the most thorough walkthrough for 1099 self employed folks like myself versus other programs.<br />I downloaded it from Amazon to my Mac Mini with no issues.  Given the significant CA tax law changes last year, waiting for an update was reasonable and it was delivered on the date promised.<br />I've tried using Turbo Tax for this in a few previous years but keep coming back to Block as TT is too oversimplified in its walkthroughs of Schedule C and other areas which makes me feel I might be missing out on some deductions.<br />Also, I appreciate that Block doesn't radically change its UI every other year, which bugs me about TT.  If anything I wish they would offer a format more similar to what Tax prep people use for those of us that can (or think we can) handle it.<br /><br />This year I've had to use the help/support option twice.  The first was with the online tax consultant which I used my freebie code.<br />I got my answer back with 24 hours as promised and it was detailed enough I think to trust.<br /><br />The second occasion I had an issue with the program itself as it has included a form I don't think should be there this year.<br />I found that the info and links to actually get to chat or email support are BURIED DEEP with the help section and you can get into a loop with it.<br />It would be helpful if you could email your questions in, rather than only have a chat or phone option.<br />I had to wait about 30min to get a rep on the Chat.  The answer they gave to my question was satisfactory.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about Block is that its FAQ section is way to simplified and lacks enough detail on common questions for items in the Form you are looking to be useful.<br />The Forum is fine, but its a pain to have to dig through that just to get answers to common questions.<br />Fixing the whole help/support functionality is my only real gripe with  the program."
1,"After seeing a lot of bad reviews concerning the download and the installation, I wanted to write a quick review after buying this QuickBooks Online Simple Sart.<br /><br />So because of the bad reviews, I was really afraid to buy this product... But I wanted to have my own opinion.<br /><br />1- Buying process on Amazon takes 1 minute (easy step)<br />2- Just after payment confirmation, Amazon opened a page with a download button (easy step too).<br />3- After downloading, I got an install file + the activation keys and I installed the product (it's not a real install because it's an online product). In less than 1 minute, a page asked me to provide the activation keys: License Number and Product Number. (easy step too)<br />4- The activation is immediate and I started to work immediately on QuickBooks. (no delay)<br /><br />I am really not Pro-Intuit or Pro-QuickBooks, it's my first time with QuickBooks and unfortunately I cannot give you any review about the product yet.<br /><br />So, it was a pretty easy and a pretty fast process. By the way, the QuickBooks version is a 2014 with a nice interface, I will try to add some screenshots on Amazon."

0,I really wanted to like this. I wanted to convert a textbook to Kindle so I didn't have to carry around the heavy textbook when I needed to read a chapter for class. You need to spend a great deal of time on the conversion. When I say time consuming I mean time consuming. I tried to convert one small chapter. It took over 2 hours. Maybe Amazon will update it and it will improve.
1,If you are going to do your taxes yourself this is the best program I have found.  I have been using this same program for 10 years now.  It is so easy and walks you through everything you need.  If you are a beginner this program will make it easy for you.

After I downloaded Office and installed that, then downloaded Outlook from Rackspace and installed that, when I try to run Outlook it just tells me that I have to upgrade to Office Business to run it, for a hundred bucks!

0,"I've been a Quicken (windows) user for 10+ years and have owned several different releases of the Quicken software.  One thing they had in common was a basic set of tools, that were (usually) improved upon in each release.  Of course there was new functionality also included with the releases.   As your needs changed, Quicken for windows was right on with a tool to support the need.      I moved into the light last year with and purchased an iMac.  Every function I needed in the Windows world I've been able to switch to Mac, with the exception of Quicken.  I now run a Parallels partition (with Windows 7)  on my iMac and then run Quicken for Windows on it.  I'm a basic Quicken user.  No big investment portfolios, no on-line updates, no check printing, just a couple of check books, credit card account, savings account and a couple of other items I keep track of.   Really basic stuff.  Even with all of the negative reviews, I made the assumption Quicken Essentials could handle it.  I was wrong.      It does look and feel different, but that's OK, I could learn the different look.  Essentials lets you track checks you've written and credit card transactions and that's about it.   It's all of the things which are missing other reviewers go into great detail discussing that are the problems.  The deal breaker for me was no basic calendar view.   You know, when you want to look ahead a few months and see what's coming and when.  Essentials can't even do that.      To me, it appears to me Intuit did not put much thought into this product for the Mac.  The requirements for the Windows version are very different from the Mac version.  Most likely there are two different development groups that don't talk to each other.  Seems Intuit might want to get on board soon.  I read Apple is now the 2nd most valuable company in the world.   Intuit, did you see that?  You are missing quite a large user base that continues to grow.      I really like your other products, but you really missed the boat with this one.   Fix it and please don't call it \\""Quicken\\"" until you do.  In my opinion, in it's current form it isn't worthy of the name."

1,"[[VIDEOID:8b0bb2fde15d6de473d91a89cd5bbe56]] I had the opportunity to test Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System in its Insider Preview Version, also known as Technical Preview Version that was released in April 2014 for Beta Testing for developers, I have been using it since April 2014 and wanted to point out several things to general public who are looking to upgrade or buy Windows 10 when its available on July 29th 2015. I want to give lots of info, but I will try my best to make it simple and short for all the readers.<br /><br />░░░░░INFO░░░░░<br />❖ Simple way to describe Windows 10: It combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7. Allot of people hated that Microsoft took away old Startup screen and If you look at few of my pictures below they kind of brought it back in Windows 10.<br /><br />❖ Windows 10 will be available in two versions: Home (price: should be 109.99) and Professional version (should be 149.99). And Windows 10 Mobile for smart phones.<br /><br />░░░░░WINDOWS 10 VS WINDOWS 8/8.1░░░░░<br />❖ Start Button is back<br /><br />❖ Cortana coming to PCs<br /><br />❖ Microsoft Edge, a new web browser for Windows 10<br /><br />*Users will be able to annotate any web page using finger/stylus or keyboard input.<br />*Spartan will have a reading mode.<br />*The Cortana voice assistant will be integrated into the browser.<br /><br />❖ The end of the password<br /><br />*According to Microsoft, users will be able to sign into commonly used apps like Outlook using a variety of biometric tools from fingerprint readers to retina scanners.<br />*You can still have password. But they are trying to make it harder to crack the password incase computer is stolen.<br /><br />❖ Multiple desktops windows, kind of like how apple has it on their computers<br /><br />░░░░░Prepare for Windows 10 install/upgrade░░░░░<br />❖ If you are running latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update You can reserve your free upgrade in the Get Windows 10 App. Once you reserve by providing your EMAIL ADDRESS, Windows 10 will download AUTOMICALLY when available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.<br /><br />This is from Microsoft website:<br /><br />\\""Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.\\""<br /><br />*NOTE: you must have all latest updates done on either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 in order to see the shortcut to reserve Windows 10. White windows logo Shortcut will show up where your clock is located on Taskbar notification area. I provided picture below that points to the icon with blue arrow in the picture.<br /><br />❖ Minimum System requirements to install the Windows 10 are:<br /><br />*Latest OS: Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.<br />*Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC<br />*RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />*Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />*Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />*Display: 1024x600<br /><br />░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░<br />❖ It actually has a Start menu now<br /><br />❖ Free upgrade for everyone (that's new)<br /><br />❖ Cortana, your truly personal digital assistant still available, its Microsoft version of Apple sari. It will be pre-loaded into Windows 10. Cortana will be able to provide regional specific answers to questions. Users will also be able to access Cortana's Notebook at any time to see what the AI knows about you and add or remove information.<br /><br />❖ Xbox is coming to Windows: Start recording gameplay in seconds, compete against console players, and stream games from your Xbox One console to your Windows 10 device from anywhere in your home.<br /><br />❖ Apps don't go away as seen in pictures below.<br /><br />❖ Office 2003 cannot be installed on windows 10. But 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming 2016 office will be compatible. I have tested 2007 and had minor issues. 2010 and 2013 work without any issues on Insider Preview Version of Windows 10.<br /><br />░░░░░CONS░░░░░<br />❖ Price is still up there. In case you are upgrading from XP or just going to buy a full copy. 109.99 or 149.99<br /><br />❖ Viruses are still an issue. Apple OSX has done a decent job. Apple can still catch viruses now days. But windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus. So antivirus is def. needed.<br /><br />This statement is form Microsoft website directly:<br /><br />\\""If your computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, Windows Defender removes spyware, but to protect yourself from viruses, you'll need to download antivirus software. You can purchase it from a third party, or you can download Microsoft Security Essentials for free.\\""<br /><br />From statement above I can tell you that Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender are useless. I personally dont even like the free Anti-viruses out their. I preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you. Every company will give you a free and then has a paid one. With paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it. That being said: there is not perfect antivirus out there. New infection arise on the internet every minute.<br /><br />As far as Apple OSX goes. Well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple. They verify apps or you will get a notification like: application is from unidentified developer. So viruses are little harder to create on Apple. But they are coming too. VS Windows computer: Microsoft doesn't care about who makes what, they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free Operating System.<br /><br />❖ Windows Media Center, and Windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer included.<br /><br />❖ Windows Live Essentials installed on your system, the OneDrive application is removed and replaced with the inbox version of OneDrive.<br /><br />❖ Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts Games that come pre-installed on Windows 7 will be removed as part of installing the Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft has released their version of Solitaire and Minesweeper called the \\""Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\"" and \\""Microsoft Minesweeper.\\""<br /><br />❖ Watching DVDs requires separate playback software now. I USE VLC PLAYER ANYWAY. NEVER LIKED WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. VLC SUPPORTS FAR MORE FORMATS, INCLUDING BLU-RAY PLAYBACK.<br /><br />░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░<br />I think it's defiantly worth trying Windows 10. I still think Microsoft needs to test it little longer in Beta face before releasing it. It will have issues here and there like all their previous operating systems. But I think it will be have allot less glitches compare to Windows 8/8.1 release. Free upgrade why not. I will update this review again once the official version is released to general public.<br /><br />░░░░░FAQ(SOME OF THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED BY MICROSOFT ON THERE WEBSITE)░░░░░<br /><br />Q: Is the upgrade really free?<br />A: Yes, it's free. This is a full version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have one year from the time Windows 10 is available to take advantage of this offer.<br /><br />Q: How long does it take to install the upgrade?<br />A: Plan for about an hour for the installation. Newer devices may only take 20 minutes, and older devices may take more than an hour. You'll need to download the installation files beforeyou begin.

0,"Pretty useful program, I use it to tine my guitar before I record using my interface. The only problem is that for whatever reason, it has a hard time with my low E string  on my bass guitar and regular electric guitar. I ended up tuning these by ear but it tuned the rest of the strings fine. Its free so you're not really at a loss."
1,"I've used this program for years.  This year, there is a problem with the GA state program.  I've contacted tech support several times and we figured out how to bypass the error."
1,I should have ordered the hard copy - I had a lot of trouble downloading it from the online site and finally had an IT guy help me. But...it's doing everything it should and it's great protection.
1,I loved I could find a great word processor without a huge price tag. If I was in a professional field maybe I would have gone with more bells and whistles but this suits my needs perfectly. The installation was easy too. I like buying my software from Amazon because I  can go back into my software library and reinstall a program when I get a new computer.
1,Does the job
1,"Great program, easy to use, easy to download through Amazon.  Thanks!"
1,Downloaded this to my PC when I needed an AV quickly.  Comparable to Kaspersky Anti-Virus.  I know use them both on different computers.
0,"The business program is still terrible!  I cannot believe that after all these years, Block has not produced a better product.  I continue to use it because I understand its shortfall and can get around it.  If you are considering business tax software, in my opinion, I would steer clear of this product."
1,I have been a  turbo tax user for years.  Today I found that although I got turbo federal and state when I downloaded Deluxe.I found I have to pay an additional 24.99 to e-file; I am furious and will end my intuit days. forever.  all you wannt to do is be greedy like all of your ilk. I don't need you people.<br />Dorothy B Lamberth
0,It was not ready for prime time this year and very frustrating to use. I feel I should receive some sort of rebate.
0,"Ran into a few issues that were not easily figured out.  Also, adding the State for $40 didn't include the E-File for state per the caveat listed on the purchase page.  No way to figure out the cost or if it meant something else.  In CA, it is really easy to use CalFile and input the numbers from the 1040.  Took 10 minutes to complete and file my start taxes.  I will not buy HR Block Tax Software again."
0,"Worst Custormer Service/Technical Support I've ever seen. I have Windows 7, 64 bit. Two or three day wait for a meaningless, pointless generic type email response<br /><br />I keep being told that some of the software they sent me is for 32 bit and won't work on my system.<br /><br />I've emailed Technical Support with different screenshots and still get the same generic type of reply with a link to the original download, that after repeated attempts to download, definitely seems incompatible with 64 bit system.<br /><br />Two weeks later at it still isn't working. Errors come up telling me<br /><br />-download SP3 (I have Windows 7 SP1 )<br />-the software will only download on a 32 bit system (I'm 64 bit)<br />-&#34;I need to have the following volume to download this system&#34;<br />-The Download was interrupted (it certainly wasn't interrupted my end)<br /><br />PowerDirector 12 functions won't work<br />AudioDirector 4 Won't download<br />PhotoDirector 5 Won't download<br /><br />I've wasted so much time on this. WISH I'd gone with Adobe Video Editing.<br /><br />Very Disappointed and let down."
0,Could be better.  Ability to get directly on to actual form without starting over would be a plus.
1,"I had a free month of creative cloud as a student and realized how annoying it was. In order to receive updates you have to be logged in and connected to the internet. Also with CC you have a chance for bugs and glitches. CS6 is proven reliable and it is only a one time payment, not a payment per month issue.<br />My only gripe is that it does not contain Lightroom. For those who aren't into photography then that won't be so much of an issue."
1,"where would my financial life be without this program, it has helped me out in so many ways, i can never be quicken free"
1,adequate for my needs. very fast
0,Worst Quicken ever. It froze up 5 times within a week after I purchased it. Very buggy. I am working on returning it now.
1,Was a great product- Loved it. Hate to have to pay for annual updates though...
0,"To bad there's no competition. Still has the bugs from Quicken 2013 plus some new ones. When I try to download transactions sometimes it doesn't give me the proper window to enter my password. It tries without a password then gets an error. Every now and then it hangs and I have Windows terminate.  Bugs from 2013 where you enter a bill reminder into the register the entry disappears. I tried online support, but the foreigner didn't understand the problem at all, I gave up after 1/2 hour of chat with 5 minutes between each entry, and several disconnects."
1,Great deal
0,"I was delighted with Quicken 2011.  I only &#34;upgraded&#34; because I was being nudged off the platform by threats that I would no longer be able to interface with my bank.  My first complaint is about the fonts.  Although I've set the register fonts to the smallest size (8), they are huge and the fonts you can't change are tiny.  I bought stronger glasses and can deal with that.  Quicken 2014 also reduced the amount of my auto loan payment.  That was nice of them, but I don't know how to break the news to my lender.  The final point of my rant and the most annoying is the slow performance when entering some transactions.  When I post a security purchase or dividend reinvestment, it often takes several seconds for the transaction to be recorded and the screen cleared for the next transaction.  Does Intuit ever release later versions with bug fixes?  If I could go back to 2011, I would in a flash."
0,I ordered this in June and it has stopped working after...less than 3 months. Online assistance is USLESS for this program!!!
1,"For the Mac, I like the new Quicken, many changes take getting used to, but with few exceptions I like the 2015 version better than our way outdated 2007."
0,"I have QB 2008, so I wanted to upgrade mainly to be able to download my bank statements. I just need to create a customer, an estimate and invoice. Problem is you cant see your list of customers. You have to select each from a drop down, then select a the invoice separately. To cumbersome and is just a fancy spread sheet. I tried everything to get this to work and after just 3 days of wasting time, I request a refund! And good luck on hearing back from them when you put in the request!!  Crazy that there is not a  VIEW just like QB that shows customers > estimates/invoice in one window. Now I know why there is no 30 day trial period, everyone would return it and it seems like I wont get my money back either!"
0,"Do NOT buy TT deluxe!<br />Intuid decided this year to remove a feature in their -already- expensive deluxe product. If you have rental income they now force you to upgrade to Premier! What a bad business practice!<br />I have been a TT customer for 15 years but this is it, I am now moving to H&R Block software or to TaxAct! Thake that Intuit!"
1,good software
1,I would have liked a CD back-up of the software but the download works great and I got the software right away and no issues
1,"As always, Corel Word Perfect has hit a \\""home run\\"" with Version X5.  I could not be more pleased.  While I know that [16] is due out momentarily, I had issues that required me to update, and I couldn't be happier.  IMHO, WordPerfect continues to knock the socks off the 'giant.'"
1,been using this for years. It does the job!
0,I never ordered this!
1,There is little danger in allowing Turbo Tax to guide you. Just follow the prompts and you can't go wrong.I have two friends that work in the IRS and they tell me the IRS regards Turbo Tax as some of the best tax guidant software out there.
1,Does the job and the price is great.
0,"Software has changed some, so I had to learn how to navigate and find things.  Main thing, it helps me balance my checkbook."
1,"I needed this asap for some school work, and was able to automatically get it on to my laptop.... and I love it!"
1,even better than the popular on sale. very user friendly and fast.
0,The only reason that I purchased Quicken 2013 was because the ability to download transcactions from online banks was about to end with my 2010 version. I figured the addition of mobile Quicken to 2013 would be a plus. Wrong! I read the reviews of others having problems with mobile and cloud syncing but figured (hoped) my experience would be different. It was not.<br /><br />Do not tried to sync to the cloud or mobile with Quicken or you'll spend a few hours restoring data.<br /><br />The real sad part is that Quicken released an update a couple of weeks ago that was suppose to fix the problems reported with 2013. The fix did not work.<br /><br />I sure do missed Microsoft Money!
1,The product is easy to use.  It was better when I realized I could download more fonts to my parents and the program would pick it up.
0,"I bought the 2013 edition from Amazon after my 2012 edition expired. When downloading the new version, the program removed the old version but the new version could not get activated. I tried re-installing several times and using Norton removal tool. No luck. Norton professional have spent the whole day remotely connected to my PC to try to fix it - and couldn't figure it out, escalating the issue several times to various professionals. I gave up as it easier to buy another program then spend days figuring out how to get Norton to work. I realize that I may have a special case, but such widely used softaware should not cause such problems for users and people working there should be able to know how to fix problems which cause it not to work."
1,Works for Me!  I do like this program...<br />Have tried different programs for same price.<br />This is the simplest and most straight forward program for downloading from<br />youtube and copying to a dvd.
0,I could not get the software to find last years tax information. It is a pain to type all that info over again.
1,"Great program. I use it every year and I am always satisfied. It's very user-friendly, and the price is great. I highly recommended this product."
0,It seems to be a complex something for knowledgeable techs.
1,love this software
0,"Would not install using Internet Explorer, McAfee support linked me to YippeeTechs who tried to pressure me into paying a $129 to fix my computer."
1,For my purposes this is as good or better than MS Office and the price?  Free!  How can you beat that price?  MS OFFICE cannot and maybe it does more or you (the user) may have to adapt or think a little but for me it's just fine and did I mention FREE?
0,"Very difficult to use.  Not user friendly.  Difficult to work with, for myself, my assistant--even while on the telephone with their telephone support.  Wasted countless hours inputting, then could never get an organized report to generate.  I finally gave up and threw it away.  Do not recommend."
1,"I began using Norton with the first DOS version, and loved it. When the Windows versions came out, they consumed monstrous CPU time. This version hides well in the background. I don't use all the features (backup, web site checking, parental controls, and such, as I only want a good virus protection program."
0,I am very unhappy with it.  I have it on my Mac and I love it.  Go figure!
0,I use this for YouTube videos i make its been working great but now it wont play the whole project i have to go to just the clip and when I go to render and save the video it does it but the video isn't on my computer so it renders for no reason and sometimes wont even render ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it I've done everything to fix it but it wont I do NOT recommend this
0,"Easy to use, easy to e-file for the feds.  The amount they charge for e-filing the state return is chicken-s**t."
0,"Tech support tried to be helpful, but ultimately this software could not be sufficiently customized for my needs.  GoodSync ended up having the features I needed."
0,Just look at the marketing info to see problems. The screen shots don't even make sense.    [...]    It's like this stuff is created in Pakistan or India for the US market. Forget it.    Intuit's higher priced products also keep your face in the manual vs. doing work for you and saving time.
1,This system works better than any other system that I have found. It is very easy to set up and with auto settings it is very easy to keep up to date.
1,I was upset at intuit for splitting the forms I required between programs but in the end they made it right. Customer pressure can be a great thing. Quality of the program was what I expected from TurboTax. They will be my first go to next year.
1,Versatile and easy to learn! Great results. Can make any photo better. I highly recommend this product to all photons.
1,I haven't filed yet but Turbotax makes it so much easier to organize everything as I prepare to file. Will buy again.
0,its ok
1,"I have been using H&R Block tax software for years. I think the user interface (UI) is much cleaner and more intuitive than Turbo Tax (which I have also used several times). Since I am very familiar with the H&R Block UI, I can usually breeze right through my taxes in no time. Great software for the money!"
0,"I was going to purchase this as a first time TurboTax user, but your helpful reviews have saved me a lot of trouble.  I guess, I will stick with finding a new accountant.<br />Thank-You!"
1,"Did my taxes (state & fed) OK.  As with most tax software, a bit tedious but since it can import prior year that helps.  I need schedule &#34;C&#34; so had to get premium ... it should be included with deluxe version but ..."
0,"i cannot believe Outlook is so difficult to use. There is no direction for setting up email as far as which one you use (yahoo, gmail, hotmail etc.) there should be specific instructions or links to clarify which you use, and how to connect the outlook exchange. Im thinking of returning it. I am a business owner and have no time to be haggling with this. ive already spent 4 hours too much on this issue. I keep getting errors saying outlook exchange is unavailable, what the heck does that mean. Does that mean the server is down? will i be notified when it will be up? Extremely unhappy customer! I hate that those that created Outlook assume everyone is a Microsoft expert!"
0,"Exactly like the other review where it hangs during install and after rebooting (because it won't let you stop the hung process), it still hangs during install. Win 8.1 system prospective purchasers, DO NOT BUY."
1,I love the usefulness of the program. Thanks Avast. You keep me safe from the internet baddies. Please find a way to save me from the NSA.
0,I am writing this review as I wait for the H&R Block chat to get back to me because I can't find the activation code.  I have been told a dozen times over the last 20 minutes that an agent would be with me &#34;in a moment&#34;.  I have had my issues with Turbo Tax but I may be regretting making the change.
1,I have been using it for years. Makes taxes as easy as they can be....but you still have to do em.
0,The Print Shop 3.5 Download<br />The Print shop 3.5 was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was not that easy to move around in the program as I thought it should be.
0,The Downloader takes forever especially with twc internet. The product is fine because my son has it on his school computer.
0,"I cannot add any more negative info that is not already listed, i had the same issues for months and still not activated properly.<br />(do not buy this product form amazon!!!)"
1,Great product. Finally upgraded from a older version.  Love it!  Easy installation too!  I bought the download version and didn't have to wait for the product to come in the mail.  Bought and installed within only a few minutes.
0,"Terrible customer service. I stopped the automatic renewal, yet it still renewed. Watch out for the &#34;free&#34; product."
1,I bought it but windows will not let me download  don't use windows 10.  It works on windows 8.1.  Works good.
1,Downloading was easy and Turbo Tax makes tax filing a snap.
0,"Software did not work as advertised. I called HR Block and did the chat support several times. They finally figured out the issue, and it was something wrong the way the software was computing the form. They said I could print out the form, go to an HR BLock location and they would help me with a workaround. I did not want to do this since I paid for the software so I could have the convenience of efiling and not visiting a physical location. So I went with TaxAct instead to file and asked HR Block for a refund. That was April 22. Two months, three follow up calls, and two follow up emails later, they still are giving me the run around and can't give me an answer about what is happening with that refund. I have no idea if I'll get a refund for the defective software, but I'm about to give up because it's just not worth the time. Their software did not work for me and their customer service, while courteous, has not been efficient at all with processing a simple refund."
1,So far it is doing everything I need it to do.  Time will tell how well it plays with others when I send letters and trty to open and edit from other word processors.
0,This is too involved and technical for a regular person to use.  Wish I hadn't spent the $
0,"Have upgraded the product from 2012 version. Like many others I have issues keeping my Wells Fargo account working in the application. Have used work arounds and fooled with it and eventually works for a bit. Contacted support over a year ago without any follow up on thier part. The fields dont seem to import the information as well as they used too. Picks random payee's and does not perform the way it did in the earlier version, have to do a lot more manually corrections. Sucks when I have 5 minutes to check my bank account and have to spend 30 minutes attempting to figure out why it will not connect to the Bank. I know it is not the Bank as I can log in directly just fine."
1,More than up to the task!
0,I've been very happy with Quicken for many years. When I had to update to 2015 I expected continued ease-of-use. Instead there were several bugs that customer service has not been able to fix.<br />Postpone updating as long as possible.
1,"I've tried several anti-virus programs, both free and payware, but I inevitability keep coming back to Advast free.  Ease of use, automatic updates, software updates and the list goes on.  Save yourself some money and get the best Anti-Virus program money can't buy."
1,works fine. could be cheaper. I bought it early in the season and it walked me through all my deductions and income just fine.
1,Top free Anti-virus program. Also available for android.<br />Fast with no slowing down of the OS. Automatically does frequent updates.
1,Windows 8 is worth it if you are looking to upgrade.
0,"I love all the reader rabbit products, problem was I paid for this twice (because you have to pay for each computer you download it to) and it wont work on one of the computers I downloaded it to. I think the issue is that this was produced so long ago that it doesn't handle all the new operating systems. When I looked it up it says it runs on Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP. I downloaded it to an older computer (I think XP) and it works most of the time. I downloaded it to a newer computer (windows 8) and it just freezes."
1,Love QB does all and more! Cheaper than Intuit's website for some reason but sounded great to me for the price!
1,thanks
0,I didn't like the answers this program gave me- and I take standard deductions.  I went to a tax pro and got different answers that make a huge difference.  Plus this program doesn't have all the IRS forms you need or even hint that you need them.
1,It is excellent and I recommend it to all users. Thank you for allowing me to partake in everyday use.
1,Microsoft office is a staple.  2010 Office Pro is the most up-to-date software of it's kind.  I highly recommend it!
1,"This is basically the free version bundled with all the free add-ons, which you can do yourself with the free version if you have the time to learn how to do it and do it (which is extremely easy by the way). The program is one of the best out there, however, because it lets you change the size of objects and customize them extensively. It does not have exactly the largest library of objects, but it is very versatile.<br /><br />The best feature of the program for me, besides the ease of the learning curve and the great and quick photo rendering, is the ability to customize objects, and even create new objects without 3D cad software. Each and every object can be shrunk, expanded, stretched and skewed every which way, stretching all the features proportionally. You can resize and shift any object in any way, with or without retaining the aspect ratio. One of the best features is that objects can merge with each other, meaning that they can occupy the same space at the same time. The reason why this is useful is because you can modify and create your own furniture pieces very easily by basically Frankenstein together existing shapes, but changing their texture and appearance, and then merging them together. A coke can with a matte carpet texture can become a lampshade, a basketball can become an oval art piece or a circular concrete building block. The possibilities are literally endless, as far as your imagination can take you. You can then easily group the items together and have new custom pieces created entirely within the program. To illustrate, I have attached a picture of a vintage, 1920s cherry wood bed with built in bookshelf and cabinets. It looks very close to the original, and was created using only 3 pieces existing in the program. A shelf, a rounded shelf, and a child bed. By expanding and contracting the pieces, and then merging them and pushing them together with the same texture, the end result can be achieved. Throw in a light source and a couple of pillows and the custom furniture, 1920s period bed was created. Show me another program that will let me do this in 10 minutes, and then create a photo rendering in 15 seconds, all for 15 bucks. Also attached is a detailed representation I did for a client representing an existing home office and library room. The room was created by customizing and creating pieces within the program, and it is entirely made up of the stock items and textures that came with the program, except for one texture on the floor.<br /><br />Fantastic product.nd the custom furniture, 1920s period bed was created.

1,"I've been using H&R Block for years.  It's reliable, easy to use, and they handled the filing delay very well this year, communicating my status very clearly at every stage.  I'll continue to use H&R Block."
1,"This was an upgrade from my Quicken H&B 2012. It downloaded nicely from the Amazon site and I was up and running in about an hour. Quicken uses its legacy formatting and user interfaces so the learning curve is short. One new feature, linking to your financial institutions for account updating, is much easier with less chance for connection errors. Thanks."
0,"Purchased 2013 mainly for mobile app. Can not get one step update to work with my bank (BOA), therefore could not get it to sync, therefore useless to me. Might work if I was willing to pay $9.95/mo to BOA for \\""Direct Connect\\"". No thanks."
1,Abode readers good quality clearly if you watching movie and image picture
1,"Quick delivery, prompt download and started to work on my project immediately. That to me is excellent! I will always consider coming back when I have a office need."
0,I am really fustrated. No Product Code showed up to get my download after paying for digital download. Ughh!! Need my Garmin updated for tomorrow.
1,Great Value!
1,This software is great and the help service is wonderful!!
0,Overpriced.  They should include the basic payroll in the price of the already expensive software.
0,"Was kind of a pain to install, conversion had some quirks, but got around those. So far working OK.  Needs more mouse clicks to do the same thing as 2001 version.  Printer interface is now the standard windows interface.  That is an improvement over 2001 and 2004.  Had to do an interim conversion to 2004 (was a free download) so that 2015 could convert from there.  2001 was to old.  Understood that.  Had the same thing with Peachtree."
1,protection is key and this does well.
1,It met all my expectations.
0,"I did not quite get how bad this was from the reviews.  People talked about having trouble but I thought they were talking about some obscure feature not the main event.  Do NOT buy this, or if you do, be prepared to spend hours on an otherwise lovely Sunday afternoon with tech support and to finally download a different copy from them.  My current one almost works except for the weird double task bar on top.  I cannot even begin to imagine why this product is so buggy expect that it lacks competition.  Admittedly, it was cheaper to buy it and suffer, but had I known I would not have done it at all.  This was, by the way, a PC running Windows 7."
1,"You know how humans are, when something changes we instantly get angry and that's all that is happening here.  The 1 year subscription is really as bad as people make it out to be for these reasons alone.  If your buying a year or two after the release it's frustrating to buy this software for $300+ and then have it go out of date the next year.  $99 gets you everything on five different computers and you can even uninstall it and put it on a different computer.<br /><br />As for the product itself yes it does take some getting used to but it's one of the best IMO.  The office software was never developed with the intention of idiots using it in the first place.  People go to college and learn how to use this software for a reason.<br /><br />Last thing, people get over yourselves and needing these physical disks.  In three more years NO ONE will be using disks anymore for anything not even video games."
0,"I understood when I purchased it that the bank figures would be downloaded and they were not! Also,Quickens took over my printer and became the default printer.  I have an HP printer. I don't like any program that will take over areas that are not necessary for that program"
1,"I bought this because I was looking for good software for building a web page. At first I found it very frustrating because I did not understand the software. However, after watching a couple youtube videos, I am good to go now for my needs. I am not designing web pages from scratch, but rather using templates. There are millions of templates available on the web from free to paid for templates. Furthermore, the student discount saved me some money since I am a college student."
1,This software is very helpful and I feel that I have gotten my money's worth. I have learned so much and have only used the product for 2 weeks.
1,I use it all the time and would recommend it for all users who need Microsoft Word and Office. Thank you!
1,This program does a lot of cool stuff and I really like it.
1,"I've used Norton products in the past, and although I liked some of the tools they had (defrag, etc.) they were certainly bloat monsters that really stole resources from my PC.  I went with other offerings for a few years, and when it came time to renew for 2011 I heard good things about Norton IS 2011.  After finding a good price for a multi-PC I dove in... and have NO regrets.      It was a breeze to setup (unlike in the past where you had to define every stinkin' program) and it works with fine stealth - yet seems very effective at stopping some potentially nasty intrusions.  It waits to scan when the PC is idle, and it recognizes \\""good\\"" programs from its own online database, which seems extensive.  Again, very seamless.  I even like the minimal desktop widget.    A very different product from a few years ago, kudos to Norton for getting back on track.  I use Win7 on an Intel i7 PC and i5 Laptop.  Excellent product."
1,"Usually it's stable and works fine. But I had to reinstall it 2-3 times per PC - required several minutes, Internet access, computer restart."
0,"This product is terrible. If you are windows user don't waste your time trying the Mac version. It simply doesn't work. Besides the inability to convert a windows quicken file, it is unable to properly track stock options and will not auto reconcile your checking account. This product should never have been released. It's Alpha quality at best. Worse, Intuit appears to be ignoring requests for refunds under their product guarantee policy. So you'll get stuck with a $50 piece of software that is worthless."
1,Avast is superb antivirus software that I've been using for several years.I  I'm amazed that it is free - even though limited for personal use.
1,Long-time user grimaces at cost.  Familiarity with product means grin and bear the freight.
0,The transfer of transactions turned out to be the most cumbersome I've ever experienced.  Had to call Quicken several times.  The software obviously has a lot of bugs to work out.  I am a long-time (10 year) Quicken user.
1,"Great tool for new learners.  Easy to follow without the reading of instructions.  Just start and go.  Vocabulary section seems a bit slow, but overall it is a great product."
1,Haven't had one virus problem since downloading the Norton Security onto my laptop!
1,I really like doing my taxes through TurboTax and I got the ideal return that I wanted and pretty quickly too. The only problem I had with it was it took quite a while to get the whole thing done.
0,"If you are a Quicken Deluxe user DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Amazon requires a review to have one star, but I would give it NO STARS if I could.  Quicken does not allow you to \\""downgrade\\"" from the Deluxe to the Starter version.  Quicken will convert your files and then lock them up.  The program recognizes that you have tried to downgrade and will not run on your files.  And your old version has been uninstalled.  AVOID QUICKEN !!!"
0,Very good tool.  Excellent.
1,"My IT guys at work recommended avast!, and it has been awesome. Easy to install and easy to use and maintain. I love it!"
1,"This program is one of the best trip planners I've used. It's easy to tailor to personal needs, good graphics."
0,"We normally buy the Deluxe version to do our taxes. We have been a TurboTax customer for more than 10 years now. But, this year Intuit changed so we had to pay for the Premier version.  We now know that we will get $25 back after we file our taxes this year, but I am not pleased being put into this position.  We will look at alternative products in the future.  Also - we moved in the past several years and really wanted the Deluxe version with no State Income Tax return, as the state we now live in has no state income tax. But, Intuit does not sell this anymore. I understand you can start your return this way, on line, but cannot buy Deluxe with no state provision."
1,"I have used this product now for more than five years and have found it to be totally reliable and thorough.  It has a very helpful interface that guides me through every step of the process, with questions at just the right junctures to make sure I don't forget something important.  It also remembers me from year to year so I don't have to keep adding the same information over and over."
1,"I have used Avast free for almost 10 years and have had nothing go on with my computer that this software didn't detect or couldn't fix. And, it's not a space hog, so it won't bog down your other applications. It just runs smoothly in the background keeping your computer safe. Highly recommended."
1,This is literally this best note taking tool money can buy. It allows you to download from your iPad wirelessly when you're on the same network.
1,I have used this application for years. it keeps me on top of all things financial. I just wish they would stop with the steep price increases each year or either give long time user a discount.
0,I downloaded the software program and found it to be difficult to navigate.  I thought it would be more comprehensive and user-friendly.
0,Terrible! After keying in all the data could not even use it.
1,"very easy to do your taxes yourself and easy to understand, I'll be useing TurboTax (Infuit) next year for my 2015 taxes Thanks Intuit"
0,"At first it looks easy to understand, but after delving into it deeper, I realized I was in over my head. My suggestion is to not buy this if it's your first venture into movie-making."
0,"WARNING: THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EFILE RETURNS FOR NEW YORK STATE<br /><br />I bought this software to prepare tax returns and K-1s for a multi member LLC because TurboTax was extremely limited and could not even support basic scenarios like the mid-year transfer of a member interest, or ANY member interest held by a foreign entity. While the H&R Block software supported the forms and logic necessary, their interface is from the 1980's,VERY difficult to use, and requires a high degree of familiarity with tax prep to be at all useful.  It is also full of bugs, can't even display its interface correctly on a standard windows monitor (see picture), and worst of all, has a critical bug, reported by multiple users, that prevents the ability to eFile New York State tax returns (which is required by law by NYS).  Tech support is useless, and revealed that they don't even have a bug tracking database, so EVERY bug must be researched from scratch for every user that reports it, as though they were the first person to report it.<br /><br />Unless you are a tax expert and just need to populate forms to file by mail, I wouldn't waste your time with this program.  TurboTax is lame, but shines in comparison."
0,"I've been using Quicken for over 15 years and this is the first time the company has let me down.<br /><br />First, it failed to import/update my data from the earlier version of Quicken.  I thought all my previous financial data had been lost.  I had to contact the company via the web chat feature through the web site.  The agent was eventually able to explain how to reset the data files (I was very happy I had made multiple backup copies of my data before attempting the software update).<br /><br />Second, several established methods of moving within the program/entering data have been changed without notice.  Having used the program for over 15 years, I am now struggling to navigate the program as easily as I did before.<br /><br />Still a great program overall.  It's.just too bad the upgrade experience was far from satisfactory."
1,"I bought this to update my Nuvi 255 2009.1 maps for an upcoming trip to FL. I don't expect to see changes to the map around my local area here in NY but FL changes pretty fast. The 5 star rating is for the process and not necessarily the map. It IS a large download at over 2 Gb. If you don't have a high speed connection I would suggest getting the DVD. I have a barely fast connection and let it run overnight. If you have registered your unit and updated the initial map and firmware you should have all the software you need. If you're not sure I would suggest going on the Garmin site and making sure before you launch the downloaded update. I keep the firmware on our units updated and have downloaded some avatars from the Garmin Garage so was confident I had current software. Make sure your Garmin is plugged into the computer and is connected before you launch the Map Update. You have to agree to the Licensing Agreement but after that you can leave it unattended. It took about half an hour on my computer and finished without incident. As far as I'm concerned this is the best way, if you have high speed internet, to update the maps on your Garmin."
0,Buggy as always.
1,"Office for Mac has never been as user friendly in a seamless way as the PC version is. However, this version is much improved over the 2004 I had for many years. The only problem I had was that the download version would not download, and it wasn't until I went through my Apple Care people, who sent me to Microsoft for Mac people, that the problem was resolved. I had to recently upgrade my OS on my iMac to 10.8.4 to enable my iPad and my iPhone 5 cloud services to sync with it, which then wiped out my Office. Apple didn't bother to tell me that would happen...oh well. I must say that the service I received from the Microsoft people( in the Philippines no less!), to resolve my problem was the best I have ever had from Microsoft; period. They were courteous and patient even though it took a whole hour to figure a solution out. It was determined that Safari did not like the new OS for this particular task. The fix was to install Firefox just for this occasion...whoda thunk that?????  Now, it works great and at least Word is easier to negotiate than the old  version. The jury is still out on Excel...time will tell."
0,"This used to be a good product, even the freeware version. But the freeware version has become annoying and intrusive, with constant operating system level pop-ups trying to get you to buy the license version... ok, so I did, and it still has pop-ups touting other versions and product.  The precise definition of things I expect it to prevent.  I do not recommended it."
1,"This is by far the best video editing software I've ever used.  It's extremely intuitive to use and I'm continually amazed at the depth of features available.  I bought this because the editing software that comes with the GoPRO cameras quit working and is very basic to begin with.  (The developers over at GoPRO recommended something from Pinnacle (Pinnacle Studio).  DON&#34;T buy that!  The basic version of the Pinnacle software cost as much as PowerDirector 13, but you couldn't even trim a video with Pinnacle!  Luckily I was able to return that after trying it)<br /><br />CyberLink PowerDirector 13 Ultra software is incredible and I highly recommend it.  I especially like the huge number of scene transitions, the ability to create slow-motion and fast-motion effects, create high-definition snapshots from a single frame of video and easily edit, overlay and import sound tracks.  The black-background of the studio environment doesn't tire your eyes during long editing sessions.  The interface is kept simple by making the control icons context sensitive ... that is, appropriate controls only appear when they're able to be used (sound editing controls are hidden until a soundtrack is chosen in the timeline, etc.).  It's absolutely simple to create slideshows from a folder of photos and add a standard transition between the slides.  Then add a sound track.  All in about 30 seconds.  There's a great online community for this software as well, so it's useful to consult with long-time users for the most advanced features."
1,the best.  people in the  internet security bussines want me prove another. but  Norton its the BEST
1,We read every review posted everywhere on this product. We had none of the problems as expressed by others. We installed the product and started using the install as soon as we downloaded from the PC version we had been using.
1,"It is a replacement for my old Photoshop 7 and I like it. There is a lot more for me to learn, but I have been able to get help on YouTube."
0,"I have used the software for several years.  This year, I needed to do form 8936 - an Plug In Vehicle Credit, but I couldn't find it anywhere in the software.  I called H&R Block and after spending several minutes on the phone with someone (after going through a ridiculous automated system that encourages you to talk to it &#34;just like a real person&#34;), the gentleman read off of a script to me to let me know that this form is not available in their software or in their online product and that I should go to an H&R Block to do my taxes.  He also stated &#34;this form will not be available this year and may be considered for future years.&#34;<br /><br />Since there is no way for me to do my taxes in the software AND include this form, the product is virtually useless to me this year.  If I go to H&R Block, I would be charged the full tax prep fee and they wouldn't apply a credit for the software purchase.  After some time on hold with the guy on the phone, he finally authorized me to get a refund which will come via the mail in 4-6 weeks.<br /><br />After looking online at several forms and posts, it appears that H&R Block software is missing quite a few of these types of forms although several other software packages, including TurboTax has them as part of their standard or deluxe offerings.<br /><br />If you need any types of forms besides the most basic, be very cautious about using H&R Block."
1,"It was simple!!!  Download, update and begin using H&R Block At Home Premium.  I have used Block for 10 years."
1,"Have used W.P. for years and wanted the latest version.  This is the best word processing program, in my estimation."
1,Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years and never disappointed. With the hacking scare I did my taxes early and am now complete. A relatively easy program that fits my needs perfectly and will very likely return to Turbo Tax next year. I especially like the feature of being able to log on and get updates as to when I can expect my refund. I just hope that in the future any security flaws have been taken care of so I can rest easy about getting hacked.
0,I do plan to get  my money back. I could not get the code to activate the product. I sent the my sons id and they did not accept a collage id they wanted a High school id. Not right at all.
1,"was a Norton user and switch because of viruses seeping into my system.  Switch to Avast, never a problem...love it."
0,"whatever you do, don't buy this!  this is the worst piece of software I've ever downloaded.  can't even believe they put this software out to the public.  Been a reluctant user of Quicken for years, and I should have known better."
1,It installed just fine and works like a charm! Have recommended to others.
1,I have used Quicken Deluxe for my personal finances for over 20 years. It with Turbotax have been an immense aid in keeping my fuinance straight.
1,Does the job. Installs and works more smoothly than earlier versions. Been using x3 mostly for a long time.
1,"I have been using Quicken for many years and you just can't beat it for managing your finances lots of options to choose from being able to download transactions, pay bills, set reminders is great.  Integrates with Turbo tax making doing your taxes at the end of the year a breeze."
1,"Easy to use<br />Should come with one state e-file included, instead of extra $19.95.<br />Will use this again next year"
1,"Since the very first time I was introduced to Norton's Security's for the computer I fell in love with it's simplicity. I have used other antivirus products, but I like this product because it covers every area of the computer, from even before I log on, to covering the desktop, safe webbing, email, spam, phishing, protection for the printer, my cell phone and so much more. Even when it's idling it scans, and I don't have to do anything. It covers basically all areas of the computer, giving me reason to feel safe. And although nothing is guaranteed or etched in gold, I feel even better when I am always alerted by Norton's, to what might be a threat on the computer, wherever the threat might be originating from. Another great thing about it is that, this package deal allows me to use it on 3 different computers for one great price."
0,"like other customers, i also cannot seem to open this no matter how many times i download it and no support anywhere!!"
1,I have used the H&R block software since 2003 and have no complaints about it.  It's a good price and it's easy to use.
1,"Like many people, I was very disappointed that Intuit \\""forced\\"" me to upgrade to 2012 by taking away the ability to upload electronically to my financial institutions.  I've been using Quicken since 2000, and quite honestly I was happy with 2009 and did not feel that 2012 offered me anything newer or better.<br /><br />With that being said, 2012 downloaded quickly and easily for me.  Before the download I did a complete \\""backup\\"" of my current quicken and saved it locally on my hard drive and on a usb drive.  The complete download, installation, and online updates all took about 20 minutes to complete.  When done it launched the new Quicken 2012 and immediately asked me to load my latest \\""backup\\"" from file.  This took another minute and it came up with all my data intact and accurate.  I tested a download to my financial institutions and they all worked fine and updated appropriately.<br /><br />I use quicken for my banking(2 checking accts, 1 savings), 401k for myself and my wife(Fidelity), kids college funds(Smith Barney), and for stocks/investing from TDAmeritrade.  All seem to be connecting and updating as expected.<br /><br />The software itself so far gets 5 stars, but I will deduct 1 star for my rating because of the \\""forced\\"" upgrade by Intuit."
1,Used it for a trust or fiduciary return. Disappointed in lack of carryover to the state return. Except for the forms might as well just fill in the forms from the state.
1,"Turbo Tax worked more cleanly for me this year than in the past. Among other things, it's (FNIALLY) clarified the handling MA personal property tax on cars properly. I've used TT since about 1994."
0,The product key is not working.
1,Great product! I have it on all my desktops and laptops. You can not beat the price. It has kept my systems clean!
0,"This software downloaded, installed and updated with no issues on my Mac, but it crashes every time I try to e-file my federal return.  H&R Block customer support is nonexistent, either on-line (live chat) or by phone (gave up after holding for 45 minutes on two occasions).  Tried all the usual things that cause other people problems with installing and updating, disabled firewall, etc., but nothing works.  I can print the return and file by paper, but it will take a lot longer and I already paid for this version that includes e-file."
1,"I was suspicious after reading some of the prior reviews but TurboTax Deluxe 2011 downloaded and installed fine on my Windows XP SP3 machine.  It did have to download Microsoft's .Net Framework 4.0 but that went without a hitch.  I ran TurboTax and installed the recommended updates, transferred by 2010 tax data and loaded my state download.  Took about 20 minutes.  Only reason I didn't give it a five star was because I haven't really worked on my return yet.  Maybe I'll upgrade it to five after I complete my return."
1,A must have ...
1,Norton has been great and has never let me down ill be ording it again soon this has been great  going to get it again
1,"This is awesome and such a great price! Yes, it starts as the 15 day trial. All you have to do is view the product key and click the renew button next to the trial days. Put in the key and you are good to go for the year! I will def use this again :]"
0,I cannot review this item because I cannot download this.  The directions provided that include a website does not allow a product code key to be entered.  I have just wasted my money.
1,"I found this product helpful in keeping my computer safe. That said, the need for the program to update its virus definitions can be a problem. Still, no virus protection software that I have used compares to this product."
0,"This review is simply about upgrading from Quicken 2011 to Quicken 2014. I suspect that like many Quicken customers I felt nervous about upgrading from the earlier 2011 version, which after 3-years of faultless operation, I had become very comfortable with and more importantly could trust. The poor reviews of last years 2013 offering, with it's many problems, had filled me with trepidation, but due to Intuits sunset policy of rendering 3-year old versions inoperable when downloading from the web (why not operate on an annual license fee instead?) I felt compelled to take the plunge. First, I took a screen shot of the 2011 home page so that I could quickly check the balances when the new version was operable, then I backed up my latest 2011 Quicken file and finally downloaded 2014. Much to my relief both the download and installation processes were seamless. When started the program rapidly found my data file and accepted my password without hesitation, then a few minutes of file conversion ensued until 2014 opened to a very familiar home page; it had kept all of my screen settings intact! More importantly all my balances were correct. I then updated all my accounts and was again pleased to see that the update time seemed to be approximately the same and that all my financial institutions communicated without any errors. The basic features of the program all seem to be working properly, however as I don't use budgeting nor do I have any requirement for the mobile application, I am not in a position to make any comment on these features. In conclusion, a painless but expensive transition to what, at least initially, appears to be a very similar product to the 2011 version."
0,"You will not install it successfully if you buy it. I contacted Microsoft, they also did not know hot to deal with it. Remember ! BUY THIS VIA THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE! OTHERWISE YOU WILL WASTE $80"
0,"I've purchased TurboTax I believe every year since the company was founded.  This year I'll go with another product because of the reduced feature set in TurboTax Deluxe.  It isn't the money, it's the way customers are being treated that will cause me to make this change.<br /><br />The tax software business is mature.  I guess to grow the bottom line at Intuit and thus have the executives make their bonuses, some features have been removed from the Deluxe version and are only available in Premium version.  It is a hidden price increase, although I guess not very well hidden based on the response here on Amazon.<br /><br />TurboTax has been an acceptable, but not great product.  It's best if you know how to do your taxes and use the program for convenience and to avoid careless mistakes.  That's why I purchased it over the years.  The fact that current versions won't open old returns (MS Word, Excel and numerous other programs open old documents), the initial screen that almost demands personal data for marketing purposes, and the requirement to constantly load updates (likely bug fixes) when the program is run, among other items, eliminate the product from A-team status."
1,"Easy to install warns about suspect web sites, good pc information. My system did not slow down and the updates are daily.  Full scan is recommended."
1,"The Norton 360 was both an affordable and effective product. Scans are thorough, multiple downloads were simple, and I would highly recommend this product."
1,"What a deal. I love Norton 360. Its easy to use and my computers have never had any problems because of it. It came with an Internet service provider I subscribed to, but since I left that company I haven't really bothered with an antivirus because they're so expensive. Then I found it here and was surprised it was just $27 for a year. Awesome. I feel a lot safer on the Web with this. It also helps keep the computer clean and running smoothly."
0,"I have been on customer support calls for a total of 2hrs.  What is the point of offering a standalone Excel app when you can't run in congress with Word 2010?  Finally gave up and will get the Office 2013 Suite.  No refund, no install.  I am just going to have to eat the $110 for the standalone Excel 2013."
1,"I have tried others, but avast is by far the best."
1,I wish I had a hard copy because I lost it on my computer when my hard drive crashed.  I was not able to download it again!
0,Be aware of additional efiling charges you'll be as unhappy as I was. I've used turbo tax for years...
1,Norton has been our choice of antivirus software for years.  Like that it can be downloaded immediately in lieu of waiting for the shipment.
0,"I'm a huge Intuit fan and have been using them for years.  However, after installing this and attempting to re-open the file after returning back it another day it's unable to open my file.  Also the sync feature is crap.<br /><br />I now have to start my finances all over again, thanks Intuit."
0,"Apology and reversal.  Thanks but no thanks (after 20 years with TurboTax).  Already purchased H & R Block.  If I feel comfortable with H & R Block for 2014, guess what software I will purchase next year unless H & R Block poached the TurboTax 2014 managers for future new strategic initiatives - I am sure the H&R Block will love your TurboTax resume and 2014 product leadership qualification.  (Never Say Never.  H & R Block could commit the same mistake 20 years from now.  So, TurboTax can wait for my return in the year 2035). Too bad greed took over and 'the LEADERSHIP' lost sight of 'SO MANY LOYAL' customers.  Good companies fall onto their faces.  Bad companies went belly up on those 'grand visions' by those 'management types' that only know what their MBA programs taught them - &#34;plenty&#34; of 'brains', but no souls ('plenty' is HIGHLY QUALIFIED and should be subject to rigorous debate).  Pretty sure they did a bunch of 'postmortem' - and yes, it is postmortem indeed.  And Business Management books will include this as a case study in the future ... and guess what ... those smart 'consultants' will try to dissect this left and right.  They still don't get it.  And I am sure there is a small relief in Mountain View now and think that 'they have the situation under control'.  And the managers might get raises and bonuses too because they work so hard to 'address' this 'critical' issue with 'customer concerns and input'.  They just don't get it."
1,"I've had PC Matic for almost a year. It works quietly in the background keeping my PC cleaned up. When I got it, my computer was riddled with problems which were fixed by running this software and it continues to do so. I'm a Sr. Citizen (a geezer) and not very technically savvy, so this keeps me out of trouble."
1,Good as always. After all this is the only company software I ever used to do my taxes.
1,"Easy to buy, download, and install."
1,I find this software works quite well for my personal PC use.  I have tried subscriptions and big name avs for whiich I paid and found that there were always issues.  this systwm is simple and does what Iask it to od.
1,good
1,I had excellent help from the techies at Amazon to install.  They were great!
1,"Norton Internet Security 2013 - 1 User / 3 PC software performs great on all my machines. As a PC technician, the need for an<br />internet protection for computers is necessary. This product provides a solution at a reasonable price."
1,Didn't face any issues while installing the program. Had another version of AVG before installing this and the upgrade was smooth.
0,I love Photoshop Elements; but this version kept freezing my brand new MacBook Pro.
1,Great
0,"Very disappointed. I have been using Turbo Tax for almost 15 years. Until this year I have always been able to enter my &#34;rental income.&#34; This year the program gave me an instruction that in order to do so I would have to upgrade to a different Turbo Tax edition. Listen folks, one size does not fit all. Every year I have been able to enter a small amount ($4,500) of rental income. I have no expenses associated with this income, no management participation, no fees, no nothing. All there is is the $4,500. There's no reason I should have been forced to upgrade."
1,Excellent value for the price.
0,Hard customer support but good software.
0,"We upgraded to Quicken 2013 because Quicken 2010 online function is not supposed to be working effective April.  We were actually pretty excited that there is a new mobile app available in which we can see our finances.  But we are disappointed.  I downloaded the app on my iPhone, but everything needs to be set up and sync through the desktop software, and it does not work.  I contacted Quicken support and was told that I need to let it \\""sync\\"" and it takes a little while to work.  Well, I've left my computer running all day (while I was at work), I have let it run while running errands, but it still does not work.  I have not been able to use this new function.  And, some of the history transferred from the older version looked weird.<br />I would have been content with Quicken 2010."
1,"Love this program. Have been using it for a month or so now, and it continues to amaze me.<br />Shots taken with my D3200 come out great, but with a quick tweak in lightroom, they come out looking amazing. Family and friends are blown away by the results.<br />An easy 5-star product, however, price is the only drawback. You DO however, get what you pay for."
1,"I was a little hesitant about the reviews I had read, but the code for the update worked on the garmin website without any hitches. The process took a total of 45 mins to update all the maps on my nuvi 780.    I cant say how good the actual update is yet, but the process of installing was fine."
0,"I signed up for the $19.99 per month teacher and student plan but now that my year is up, they said I would be renewing at $29.99 per month.  It's their attempt to pull you in and then start charging you $120 more a year."
1,"The reason I like it is,they do not intrude with whatever I'm doing on line.That means alot to me..<br />They keep me informed of what they did or are going to do with with my computer with a small discreet box in the lower corner.<br />They give me choices of what new things they offer.<br />THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE."
1,"I can't speak to how this ranks among other virus protection software, but my systems seem to be running virus free, so I guess that's all that matters.  I also gave it five stars for the price, ease of purchase, download and installation."

1,It walks you through step by step.  Its simple to use and checks your entry for potential errors.  As a professional in the tax field I recommend this product to people looking for a tax professional who I believe have returns simple enough to do on their own.
1,I love NORTON. I especially like the &#34;Identity Vault&#34;  So easy to manage your passwords and they are encrypted  each time you use them.<br />Scans and updates are easy as well.  I had a 3 year subscription to Webroot but uninstalled it an went back to NORTON.
0,"I bought Office Professional 2013 (not from Amazon) that contained a scratchoff &#34;credit-card' number for downloading and installing.  The two primary add-ins for Excel were not part of the software, Powerpivot and Powerview.  I contacted Microsoft and they said my version was the &#34;enterprise&#34; version not the &#34;plus&#34; version and that the add-ins are not included in the enterprise version.  The package only said &#34;Office Professional 2013&#34; just like the package I see on Amazon.  How does anyone know what they are buying?  If I order from Amazon can I be sure I am getting the 'Plus&#34; version that Microsoft said I needed?"
0,The serial number did not work and not happy with the  instant download that I was promised
0,"I cannot count the number of years I have used TurboTax, simply because it knows what I need every year without entering a lot of data and asking a lot of questions.  Frankly, I'm reviewing this without having bought 2014 because I can't figure out what I need from the way-too-many-versions list.  The changes, explanations, and counter-explanations are to the point that I don't even know what's true now vs. yesterday vs. rumor.  My dad has always used TaxCut, and I think this is the year to give it a try.  #majorfail"
0,Intuit is pushing &#34;intuit data protect&#34;. pop ups are built in the software and are driving me and every blogger nuts.<br />shame on intuit!
1,The Microsoft suite of software applications is a universal standard so I needed it for a new computer.  I thought I'd give Amazon a try since their price was competitive.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that downloading it through Amazon was a breeze.  I would consider purchasing other applications from Amazon due to the ease of downloading this product.
0,I ordered this product since it indicated that it would prepare 1120s return.  It appears that it only presents the same form that is downloadable from the IRS for free.  Attempts to contact customer service via online chat involved a wait in excess of 30 minutes after which I terminated the session.
1,This worked fine for me.  It was a lot like TurboTax.  No problems.  I reported some self employment income and processed an adoption tax credit.  H&R Block handled both fine.  I downloaded the application and did my taxes.  State did not cost more.
0,Does not print where it is suppose to print on envelope<br />Would not recomend it for others since it does not line up well
1,Have been using this for years and it works very well.
0,caused my dvd drive to fail. I would not have known this unless a friend installsd it and hers quit working also. check it out online via google.
0,It caused my Outlook to not work and I was unable to get to a lot of websites.  On top of that it slowed my computer way down.  I uninstalled it and bought something else.
0,"When I installed downloaded file, the program didn't start at all.<br />I tried on 3 different PC(windows 7 and 8), still it didn't work.<br />I couldn't get refund from amazon because it is download version.<br />I had to request refund to Intuit via email(ereturns@intuit.com). Intuit didn't respond to my request at all.<br />I'm still waiting their response after 2nd request for refund.<br /><br />Don't buy any download version. Amazon don't guarantee any electronically delivered item even though they get paid immediately."
1,Last year I bought Norton 360. It cost a lot more money and really didn't do much more than this version does.  I don't know how but I got a terrific deal at $19.99. I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone else.
0,"Does it do what it claims? Yes. Is it easy to use? Yes. However, full HD recording is too choppy to be useful. The exact same hardware can record decent full HD with other software."
1,"Microsoft has finally got upgrades right, fast download, easy install and best of all i didn't have to go back and re-load any software or try to figure out any program conflicts. Downloaded, installed, and ran without 1 problem. This is the way upgrades should be."
1,"I first tried out this product through a Groupon with both of my 5 year old twins, and I was very impressed! Because I also teach a Montessori preschool, I decided to purchase a classroom license and avail it to my more advanced students who were beginning reading. I really like that lessons are short and focused (usually one phonogram at a time or a few sight words) and then there are several activities to practice the concept. My experience is that each lesson take between 10-30 minutes depending on a child's readiness and interest/focus. There is a reporting tool on the backend of this product where parents/teachers can view the student's proficiency, amount of time spent, and other key indicators that help gauge student mastery. I also like that students could not advance without achieving a certain proficiency (I think 80%). Furthermore, because this is web-based, students can work on it at home and it doesn't have to stay in the classroom (especially helpful during extended vacations and summer breaks); likewise if you buy it for use in your home and want to use it elsewhere, you just log in and pickup where the child left off. The workbook for it (it was available as a free download through the web-based program) provides even more varied learning activities for each lesson and provides the important writing aspect that students would miss if they only worked on the computer. My preschool parents whose children use this program at home have been very happy with it and further recommend it to their friends and relatives. I highly recommend!"
0,"Very disappointing, what use to be a simple handy program made complicated"
0,Had to buy it since my previous version no longer would download financial transactions and that's all I need it for.  Total rip off.
1,By far the best small business accounting software on the market.
1,"don't forget the email you used when you first installed office. if you forget it. It will cost you $99.00, a brand new one is only 113.00. so now my office is $210.00. what a scam"
1,"Please don't have your accountant or the IRS call me, but this tax software at least appears to be so good, and so easy, a monkey would have a hard time getting their taxes wrong!  I am an independent contractor and after being charged up to $1,500 for my accountant's receptionist to do my taxes (did she use TurboTax?) and for him to check it, I decided to give TurboTax a try.  Following what appears to be complete and certainly thorough directions, I entered all my information, just like the account had done in past years, and out came a complete tax return with all the forms filled in just like I had been paying to have done.  Now, I suppose that you could run into problems (You already know some tax companies advertise that they can get you more money by fixing what other paid professionals missed or screwed up on your return, right? And, they get paid for it!) if your information changes, or if you enter items in the wrong places, but the TurboTax software does check for mistakes, points out areas where you may be audited (according to statistics) where you can also look for mistakes, and you can ask questions, search help, or join forums to get more information, PLUS you can also sign up for tax audit assistance and representation.  I am one of the most skeptical people you'd want to meet, but I feel comfortable in my third or fourth year of using the software. Good luck!"
0,"Each year Turbo Tax becomes a dumber and dumber program. It is supposed to interact with your last year's return to make sure that you get the same types of deductions that you did in previous years, but it no longer happens automatically. For instance, the home office deduction and depreciation. This year's version failed to pick up that for the last several years I had a home office. Had I not gone into the forms section and found the one for the Home office deduction, and &#34;forced&#34; Turbo Tax to include it, I would hot have gotten the deduction. Same with depreciation. In order to get the maximum legal deductions, you have to personally know something about the tax code. That is not the way Turbo Tax advertises this product."
0,"I enjoy Turbo Tax.  I use it every year.  The biggest problem I have with this is that when heading to Amazon to purchase, there are way too many different versions available.  And, it's way difficult to determine which is which, and which one I need.  I bought this one thinking it had free Fed and State Efile, but it did not.  That is the only problem I had with this.  So it may not be Intuit's problem, and maybe more of an Amazon product offering/description."
1,I've been saved a few times by this fantastic software. It updates automatically and doesn't bloat my computer with unnecessary software.
0,Too many problems with Turbo tax soft ware. Unlikely to use again. Poor customer service.
1,"Great program, easy to use. Just what I was looking for."
0,Terrible. I have been using Quicken a long time and in general (despite a lot of annoying bugs) it worked ok. I usually lagged behind a year in terms of upgrading because of how many bad reviews the new product always gets. So in 2014 I was using 2012 and in 2013 I was using 2011. This year I thought I'd be bold and went ahead and purchased 2015. What a mistake!!<br /><br />The program constantly freezes. I'm simply trying to add a brokerage account and some transactions MANUALLY. I'm not even trying to connect to online services. The stupid thing freezes every time I try to change the date of the transaction to anything other than today's date. Ridiculous!!<br /><br />I wish I had listened to all the other reviews about this product. Save your money and headache. Do NOT buy this. Besides I see no meaningful new features since Quicken 2013 anyway.
0,"For years I have asked for simple little fixes. Each year they leave the same issues untouched. I have sent many requests to Intuit and never once even received an acknowledgement. Now, I cannot even find a way to communicate to Intuit! I can speak up in the \\""community\\"" of other lost and unhappy users, but no more can I just click a link and communicate to Intuit. You try it. I don't know what happened to Intuit, but if I could stop using Quicken I would. Someone needs to make a better Quicken because it seems like every improvement is just more shuffling of menu items and bloat. How about some simple little usability fixes:<br /><br />1) Allow the resize of the download pane and add some tools to it to select and catagorize and sort. Not even a sort on this window!<br />2) Renaming is a chore. How about a little help there.<br />3) Search and replace windows are just too narrow to see the text and yet will not resize. Why? Is this a big probem to create resizable windows. I don't think so.<br />4) Undo: How about an undo for the simple register mistake? Too much to ask?<br />5) Pull-down menu items that don't take two or more keystrokes to get a change from.<br />6) Inappropriate messages that do not relate to the task at hand. Such as asking me if I now want to add the account that I am actually updating.<br />7) How about not forcing us to upgrade to an even worse implementation by stopping our ability to download transations.<br />8) Respond to customers or at least let them know with an auto script that you got their email. Something!<br />9) Just put it back to the way it was in 2000 and before.<br />10) Fire the suits and hire a new programming and project management team to do all the above.<br />11) No simple way to request a fix or suggest a feature request. Oh yes, there is a link to click on but it's where that link takes you that is useless.<br /><br />What do I do for a living? I design software and manage software teams. I was a programmer for over 3decades. During that 30 years I used extensive feedback from users to design and develop.<br /><br />Using Quicken is a frustrating experience each time I fire it up and Intuit does not seem to give a hoot about the user experience. HOWEVER, you will see all sorts of promotion for how easy and great their software is and how neat all the new features are. What a laugh...if I could."
1,I love this Winzip and the price I paid was a great value. I use it every day and it beats using the free version all the time.
1,The customer service was awesome to be able to download automatically and the tax software was user-friendly throughout the process.
1,Works like a charm.
0,Big problem if you already use Lightroom on other macs.
0,Won't download!
1,We use AVAST and we appreciate it.  The price is reasonable if you want to upgrade and the free product works very well.
0,Hard to rate when you can't download it thru amazon.  All I get is &#34;windows cannot access the file&#34;.  Might be me but I don't feel like wasting a day troubleshooting what should be a simple download.
1,good free
1,Turbo tax is easy and a great tool for doing your taxes! I have used this program for years! Love it!
1,"I bought the game to entertain the grandchildren who are just starting school.  They had fun for a while each taking turns coloring a few pictures.  I watched and the game is simple for even the youngest one of the three.  Click a color and click on the screen.  Pick another color and keep going.  It was fun for them and once again after I showed them what to do they needed no more help.  No brush strokes needed, click color than click an area inside the lines and it paints the area itself.  Hope this helps."
1,Perfect every time
1,"Very convenient and less expensive to have a lifetime update versus purchasing periodic updates.  A bit challenging to figure out how to navigate the Garmin website in order to get setup to do the downloads to your GPS.  Once you figure that out, then it's straightforward.  Must be patient because it takes a while to download each of the map updates.  I just setup a download and went to bed."
1,Great product.  I have been using it since 1998 and it has not let me down yet.
1,i love it cause it means I don't have to get a new computer for one and plus it continue to keep up with the times of all the viruses out there. To keep my computer clean. And to furnish a free software also to have the option to get the pro if I need one.
0,"I have never seen so many bugs with Quicken 2015!!! I have been on Quicken for years and I should have stayed on the previous version 2013. Password problems, reconciliation not working correctly. If there was a better product I would consider it."
1,"Use it every year! Very easy to follow, plus online help is available. Would recommend to anyone that does their own taxes."
1,Avast has performed well above my expectations for well over a year now. I can truly say that I have had fewer problems with viruses. I  have tried others an was not please with their results. Just give it a try and you want regret it.
1,To anyone looking for a Great Antivirus I highly recommend Avast.  I have been using it for years now and I have never had a virus problem on my PC.  And the other best part is it's Free if you choose the Free version. I would use no other.
0,"WARNING: This software does not mention that you need to efile your federal return in order to efile a state. It's not common, but I chose to file paper file my federal return for personal reasons. I'm now told I have to paper file all my state returns. Wasted money when I could've just filed on the state website for free."

1,Awesome product!!
0,"I purchased this since my quicken 2010 was no longer working properly. Turns out this one is not either. After sending multiple response to the forums they were unable to help me, even after providing screen shots. I contacted live chat to resolve this, which was futile since he apparently had no clue what the issue was even after linking my forum sessions. He was asking me to do things that was already covered in the forum post I had, I had to ask him again if he even read the post. Once I open quicken and say click on bills tab, the bottom window still shows the home page happens with any tab. My work around is when I select a tab I have to minimize it then restore for each tab and only then will the proper tab window show up and I can use it."
0,I am one to use my software until I am forced to move to another version or product so I upgraded to 2015 from the 2008 version. The new version is very similar to what I am used to but different in some subtle ways. I dislike the way the bill reminders work compared to the way they worked under 2008 but it may be just a matter of getting used to them. I like the fact that I can now print a report if I want to (2008 would not print them).  I like the fact the general look and feel of the software is very similar to the older version so I don't have a big adjustment there. I have not really tried to do a lot of new stuff with it so I can't comment on any new features it may have. I dislike the quirkyness I encountered when trying to back up my file on an external thumb drive.
1,Works fine. Have used Norton for years and this was a good deal for coverage on up to 10 devices. Will use again.
0,Like the other review said: this is the program to run the software BUT it will not run unless you buy a scripting. I get that. But that should be clearly stated.
1,Very good software highly recommended
1,QB has drop down menus that expidite your work.  I LOVE this version
1,"Although these two programs work fine, their GUI is really 'Bland Looking'. My previous version of Adobe Photoshop Elements was 7.0. It has a much better looking interface (GUI)."
1,After trying a myriad of other photo editing software packages ranging from free to highest priced this one fits the bill for just about anyone who is serious of managing their collections.  With extensive help and video tutorials this one is definitely a winner.  I highly recommend the purchase of this especially the current price which reflects a good discount.
1,works great on windows 8
0,"UPDATE: The new eLive tab is just plain pain in the butt! It often interferes when I try to open a digital pic to edit!!!  I &#34;upgraded&#34; to v.13 from v.9 and it wasn't worth it. I don't like or use the &#34;Organizer&#34; and all of my editing is for on screen viewing so I don't need any the printing features. I can see is no speed difference between the 32- and 64-bit versions.  But my major gripe still remains Adobe's insistence on printing as a final goal. The cropping presets are for 8&#34;x10&#34;, 5&#34;x7&#34;, etc., and not 1920 px x 1080 px. 1280 px x 1024 px, etc. which are my final goals. The work arounds are kludgy at best.

0,"I can't believe that all Quicken products are not available for Apple MAC.  Every software developer, designer, musician, graphic artist, and entrepreneur I know uses a MAC laptop.  It infuriates me to have to have a windows product to run Quicken financial products.  Can't wait to find your MAC-enabled competitor."
0,"I've used QuickBooks Pro for 15 years, and I keep wishing there was a decent competitor to whip this lazy, under-achieving software relic into shape.  Intuit embodies everything bad that you typically find in an established, nearly-monopolistic company: they are arrogant, they have lackluster customer service, and their software &#34;innovates&#34; at a criminally-sluggish rate.  They are right there with the likes of Quark, Novel Networks, and Lotus Notes.  Please, oh please, let there be an Adobe or Microsoft to come in and give small business something magnitudes better.<br /><br />I just upgraded to version 2015 with mediocre hopes that the new e-mail templates feature would solve some of my invoicing & monthly statements needs.  Hahahaha... make that foolish hopes.  As you would expect, this promising feature is barely half-baked.  Here are just a few obvious deficiencies:<br />1. There is an un-editable, un-deletable &#34;Basic Template&#34; for everything that is constantly in the way when you go to pick your template.<br />2. You cannot send through Outlook.<br />3. You cannot use rich HTML<br />4. The merge fields are extremely limited. For example, there's no field for [statement-total].<br />5. You cannot link an email template to an invoice template (IE setting a default email template for whenever you send a progress invoice).  DUH!!<br /><br />I have a long list of perennial complaints, but to keep this review short, I'll list just a couple others.<br /><br />Charts in Reports.  I'm pretty sure the graphics engine hasn't changed on this since 1995.  Nor have the chart options.  Oh wait, there aren't any.  You just get the same basic bar and pie chart. Really? This IS 2015, right?<br /><br />Sunsetting Features.  Intuit is notorious for this, including in their home finance software, Quicken.  If you download transactions directly from your credit card or bank (and who doesn't?), Intuit extorts you into a forced upgrade at least every 3 years.  After 3years, they simply turn transaction downloads off.  THAT. IS. EXTORTION.<br /><br />Forced Advertising.  It's been clear for a long time that Intuit cares maybe 10% for its desktop app business, 40% for its online subscription service, and 50% for up-selling you on additional services.  Brightly-colored icons for things like &#34;Order Checks & Supplies&#34; are always on in a locked, left-sidebar pane.  Sorry, Intuit, I already accept credit cards, I have plenty of checks & supplies, I don't need business financing, and I certainly don't need your help promoting my business.  PLEASE let this at least be a preference setting to turn off!<br /><br />OK, that's enough venting for now.  I just can't believe Intuit has managed to stay entrenched in the small business accounting software space this long.  Year after year the &#34;upgrade&#34; headlines sweet nothings such as &#34;user interface enhancements&#34; which I'm pretty sure for 2015 means they changed the sidebar color to blue.  It's clear they are dragging along with a codebase that is old and archaic.  This is not even close to 2015 software.  1995, maybe.<br /><br />So, please... someone make something better!"
0,The reason why I loved Amazon Cloud Drive was its ability to sync with a folder on my PC.  Organizing photos on the website is a pain.  I want an easy way to organize on the desktop and then have the folders sync up to the cloud and match.  can't do that anymore.<br /><br />Seriously?
1,I have been using Office for years.  With the subscription I can load it on up to 5 PCS.  It also come with 27 gigs of online storage.  I don't have to worry about back ups to my home system which is aging and can fail.  24x7 availability from anywhere I am connected.
1,I have used turbo tax for several years and it is a great product that is easy to understand and to use.  I would suggest turbo tax for anyone looking to do their taxes on their own because it makes them very simple.
0,"This software is a joke.  Their developers should be ashamed.  I installed it, told it not to pull anything, then took data anyway (old, didn't make any sense) and put my currency in GB pounds instead of dollars, and I can't find any type of customer service to assist me in making it right.  They just say &#34;go online&#34; then send me to a user community.  Charging me for software then putting customer support in the hands of other paying customers?  TACKY.  Intuit: You should be ashamed of yourself."
1,"I have used AVG, the windows defender, but so far<br />I like Avast the best. It's free, no maleware, bloatware,<br />it doesn't seem to slow things down.  Just no complaints.<br />I have used it for almost 4 yrs now. Since the basic version<br />is free, nothing to lose by trying."
0,"will be cancelling all my Norton subscriptions, since the company is greedy, and unhelpful to its customers.<br />installed Norton on one computer, but it used up two licenses.  took 10 minutes at Norton website to find a phone number for support that didn't cost additional $, and when I spoke with support they refused to re-set the subscription to just one license used.<br />Norton product is OK, but only if you have no problems with it, you are toast if you need help from them."
0,I have been a long time user of Quicken.  In 2012 I upgraded from Quicken 2010.  What a mistake.  The budget process has been destroyed.  I also had problems updating my investment portfolio.  After trying it for a few months I went back to Quicken 2010.  I understand that the 2013 update does not address any of these problems.  My time is now focused on an alternative since Quicken has shown little interest in addressing any of the problems.  Too bad for what used to be a wonderful product.<br /><br />I might add that to go back to an older version is not easy.  You must first recover the file at the date of conversion.  Then you must manually reenter each transaction from the date of conversion.  So if you try to ungrade do not wait too long to decide if you love it or want to go back.
0,For some reason I couldn't get it to work.
1,"Gets the job done with out slowing my computer too much. Decent price, so I have continued with this brand. Very easy to use and navigate. System scans do take FOREVER though. Much longer than in previous Kaspersky versions. I just start the scan before I go to bed, that way I'm not waiting on it and getting annoyed. For me they regularly take 9 hours or so for a full system scan, where as in previous versions I remember them taking 2, maybe 3 maximum."
1,"Mine works fantastic. I used to be a Norton guy, no more. PC Matic is MUCH BETTER."
0,I was able to upload almost 200GB to the cloud.<br /><br />Pros: CR2 (Canon Raw) is recognized as a photo file type<br />Cons:<br />1) Upload is very slow.<br />2) No easy way to upload only new/updated files.<br />3) Not a good &#34;sync&#34; app<br />4) Not a good &#34;backup&#34; app
0,"A long-time Quicken user, I upgraded to the 2013 release rev.5 - and what a mistake that has been.  Split transactions are duplicated, paychecks doubled, random deletions, mobile app does not sync (I've now disabled it to try and stop it messing things up), Bank of America accounts no longer download, incorrect categories assigned... the list goes on.  I have spent hours online with customer service trying to resolve matters, scoured forums, I have had to groom my datafile TWICE in order to remove duplicates and errors, even then ending up with a transaction correction.<br /><br />Once upgraded, I can see no way to downgrade back to 2012 and claim a refund, when I try and uninstall it the uninstaller crashes, all in all, a MESS.  Hopefully Intuit get their act together pdq and release a patch that corrects these issues.  Because currently, it is worthless."
1,"Easy to download, install and navigate.<br />An easy to use product and Continues to be the leader in tax prep software."
1,Upgraded from Quicken 2008. Nice change. Haven't used much of the new features but the interfaces is nice and the program seems a little snappier.
1,"great software that was easy, and enjoyable at the same time.  for some reason I still had to pay to file state though."
0,"Slow, buggy, cumbersome to use. What takes a split second to do in a regular spread sheet software, takes minutes to do in this program. As an example, the cash flow section might take a minute or even two to update after you enter a new number, and that is only after numerous refresh attempts. As a result, you spend frustrating hours on what should take minutes.<br />Also, because most default setting don't allow for entering many real life scenarios (eg. interest only payments on loans in the first few months) most of the time is spent on trying to figure out how to override the system.<br />To top it all, often, an error message will appear for hours when you try to edit the plan, rendering the program completely unusable. No good when your banker is waiting for you..<br />And the last straw? I have been subscribed and a paying my fees for a year now, and in the meantime PaloAlto has reduced some features in the program, forcing me to erase a full year worth of data.<br />Overall, I would give it a D-. The general company attitude is \\""unfortunately, this is what you get with this product, all your important stuff is with us, you are stuck\\"". It truly feels like a rip-off service/product, borderline scam and it needs a good competitor."
0,I found it is not easy at all to use.  I need something that is intuitive to use.
0,We've been using QB since 2004. Hit and miss but managed to have it working all this years. Latest version is by far the worst. We've been using Intuit Merchant solution to charge credit cards in QB. Every 90 days QB prompts to reset the password for security. Fair enough. In this version when the time came to reset the password QB reports that password was changed and immediately prompted to change the password again. It stock in the password reset loop and we could not access the file at all. Then started spanning weeks communication with support from India on this issue to no avail. They claimed the file was corrupted. Held it for a week and returned still not fixed.  Thanks to Google search we found a guy posted with similar problem. The only solution that worked for us was to use backup of the QB the day before the error and cancel Intuit merchant account to disable password protection. Intuit still holds our file for 3rd week to no avail. You can only leave voice mails to their data recovery team or send an email. In our case they no longer responding. They gave up. They heave no clue. Probably with their support they outsourced development as well. It shows.
1,I LOVE PC Matic!! My computer has never run this fast. I don't have to worry about trying to keep the junk off. PC Matic sends me an e-mail every day with a full report on what it did. I have scheduled daily scans.<br /><br />It has protected me from viruses that tried to get into my computer.<br /><br />The price is very low for all the features you get. The download to install went through without any problems. Anyone could do it.<br /><br />I have found the perfect protection for my computer and I highly recommend this product.
1,I like it much better than my previous program
1,Price could be a little bit better but have used it consistently for many years. It could be a little more user friendly.
1,"I have not used QuickBooks for over 7 years.  There were many changes, but I picked this up and felt right back at home pretty quickly. Great product!"
1,"Incredible time-saving software. Once you have it set up, just click one button and download all your bank and credit card information quickly and easily! I'm a procrastinator, and usually wait til tax time to manually enter all the year's info. Not anymore - this makes it so easy. No more manual entering! Hint: most banks only allow you to go back 90 days for download history. Don't wait all year to hit the button! Do it monthly when you get your statement. Love it!"
0,"I am sorry to say I had so many problems with this purchase and download, I had to cancel the order."
0,"Not long after I made the purchase, I read that a calculation bug caused the IRS to have to manually process tens of thousands of returns, significantly delaying refunds.  Well, if there is one big bug, there are likely many others.<br /><br />When you launch, rather than getting right to work, you have to wade through a few screens to get past the up sell to the next higher version.<br /><br />For several years using this product, I've put up with a poor user interface, glitches in the PDF printouts, missing state forms and other problems.  Given that the software was released with show stopper flaws, I'm seriously considering not using it and finding an alternative product."
1,Worked very well after getting it loaded.  More my fault than the softwares
1,good
1,Use turbo taxes every year for at least  the last ten years. This was a down load. Didn't go through the first time because of winter storm that knocked out power in NC and  southern states for 2 to 4 days. No problem though. Contacted Amazon; down loaded again NOW UNCLE SAM CAN GET BIG CHUNK OF MY MONEY. who do I thank for this?
0,"I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but I have to review this.  I have used this product for 10 years so I know what I am doing.  I just converted from 2007 to 2012 today, but the new software update is flawed and business invoices (e.g. bills) are coming out as 'credits.'  They informed me that it will be fixed in about 3 weeks.  So, basically for the next 3 weeks, this product is totally useless. (you cannot create a business bill.)  I am requesting a refund today from Amazon.  This 2012 is horrible. I have no complaints about the other versions though."
1,Has about 95% of the Tools in Photoshop.<br />I do great stuff with it.  Good value if you are hesitant to subscribe to CC.<br />Have not delved into Premiere Elements yet.
1,"Simple and useful and works on my Mac. Two reasons to like it :)<br /><br />But I found something else: I save movies for my iPad and watch films and TV-series whenever I want: in the street, in a cafe, in an airplane and in my bed.<br /><br />Nice thing!"
0,I used a previous version of the program and did not have as many problems setting up accounts and expenditures. I needed to go back to the basic instructions to understand this version. Still wondering of my excel spreadsheet is just as effective.
0,"I was happily using Quicken 2011, and everything worked as needed.  Due to the Quicken forced upgrade program, I purchased the 2014 version directly from them with an end of year special.  The upgrade seemed to go without incident.  My experience after using for several days is as follows:<br /><br />- My largest issue is downloading investment transactions.  I've had it download, display a red flag, and not show any transactions.  I've had it download, display a red flag, and after accepting transactions, still display a red flag.  A follow up transaction download request seems to clear it up, by removing the red flags, and sometimes retrieving additional transactions.<br />- Downloaded transactions into my checking, savings, and credit cards did not keep memorized categories they previously had.<br />- The program seems to operate more slowly.  Scrolling is choppy and not smooth.<br />- The Savings Goal display has been expanded to a needlessly to large of a display, and requires scrolling if you have more than five accounts.<br />- The &#34;cloud&#34; operation for will add significant time to your updates.<br />- I've downloaded the mobile app, but have only utilized it for a false transactions experiment.  Access to enter transactions via the iphone app is through a very small icon at the bottom right of the screen.  It seems a little clunky to get to a specific account, defaulting to the last one selected.  It takes three menu selections to change accounts.  Once a transaction is entered via the app, you are unable to see or do anything with it, and has gone to the cloud.<br /><br />After reading the 2013 upgrade fiasco, I was dreading the date I would have to be forced to upgrade.  Fortunately I didn't incur any installation errors, or lose any data.  I haven't found any new features for my daily use for banking, and investing.<br /><br />I've only given two stars because of a forced upgrade that really hasn't provided me anything new.  Perhaps sometime in the future they can derive a lower cost upgrade/fee to continue online access.  Let's face it, how much more can you do with registry entry other than changing some colors!"
1,good
1,"My third year using this H&R Block downloaded version for my small business, and I'm still a happy customer. Easy walk through that imports the previous years basic info, eliminating a lot of  work.    This year the only slightly annoying feature is the 'update'  as a notification states that the next Federal update for windows is on, or before Feb. 12. You could still file before the update, but no one seems to know what happens if you file BEFORE the update? Not sure if it's H&R, the Federal Government, or Windows fault for the late update, but it certainly should have been completed long before Feb. 12. I can't seem to find out for sure if this package will submit a 1040X (extension) if the update requires any substantial changes    If not for the late update (also had to wait for State update to file) this would have been 5 stars, and I do recommend, and I'll continue to use the H&R Premium download from Amazon.  ...but someone please speed up the updates for early filers.    UPDATE: 2/12/15 The latest update was installed, and even though I already filed, no further action seemed to be needed as nothing was changed for me. So even though I'm still not 100% sure about updates, I can only conclude updates are for extraordinaire circumstances."
1,The Turbo Tax Deluxe met the tax needs for my family this year. I did have a bit of concern with the hacking news but obtained this year's copy after action was reportedly taken to resolve the issues. Another issue I would like to see to go back to previous versions is the return of Schedule C to the deluxe version as folks nearing retirement could likely resort to some form of self-employment to supplement their retirement and should not have to purchase the Business version of Turbo Tax to file their taxes.
1,"Great Product, in terms of level of protection, ease of installation and updating. They often prompt you to subscribe to the paid service which is fair enough. Just watch what you click. It has become more intrusive than it was: warnings popping up from the bottom right corner of your screen a couple of times a day. Just click no."
0,Pros<br /><br />- Serves its purpose.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- It refuses to recognize H&R Tax files regardless of whether they are T11 or PDF files. So you are stuck with having to enter the data from scratch.<br /><br />- When filing the State form for Illinois it said I had to fill in a number in IL 1040 line 1a. That's all it said. No additional help and no indication what line 1a wanted.
1,"Downloading this software via Amazon is very easy and convenient. Amazon also keeps a record of your purchase, so supposedly if something happens to your computer and you lose the download, it allows you to re-download and tracks that for you for free.<br /><br />As for the Office products themselves (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.), they are so much easier to use and such better products than anything Mac  has. The documents created by these products also, obviously have the added benefit of being accessible via PC or Mac -- something the Mac products cannot always do."
1,Always a good software program.  Guides you every step of the way.  Keeps your depreciation schedule from year to year.
1,I enjoy this antivirus.  It doesn't slow my PC down and seems to keep updated with all the new gunk that gets thrown at it.
1,"I really like Quicken and used it for years.  I use it for normal bank accounts, investments, credit cards and budgeting.<br /><br />If I have any complaint, it is that some annual changes simply seem to be for change-sake.  It just forces you to learn the new system and creates unneeded confusion."
0,"Quicken 2013 follows the path of earlier versions with more features than most people can possibly use.  It's a fun product if you enjoy connecting to online resources and setting up the software to do elaborate budgeting and financial or retirement planning.  If you just want to balance your checking account, there are bells and whistles here you'll never use.<br /><br />The biggest surprise was that data files that had been saved by the old Quicken running on Windows 2000 couldn't be read directly by Quicken 2013, even though a feature listed for the Deluxe version was the ability to convert old-version data files.  I found on a Quicken forum that it was necessary to uninstall Quicken 2013 and install Quicken 2004.  Then the data files need to be imported and saved in 2004 format, and Quicken 2004 uninstalled.  Finally re-install Quicken 2013 and load the data files and they will be automatically converted from 2004 format.<br /><br />After the somewhat involved update process, Quicken 2013 seems to perform well and register data entry glitches from the old version have been cleaned up well.  The mobile device feature is also not quite ready for prime time, so this is another area you can expect to need special updating of the software to be fully functional."
1,"Never learned to do my own taxes, always had to pay someone to do them. Tried Turbo Tax and now I do my own taxes. Really easy to do."
1,I will continue to use TurboTax and recommend it to everyone I know! If it ain't broke- don't fix it!

1,No problems installing. No problems with it at all on my Windows 8!
0,"I hate it!  Taxes are painful enough without having to deal with software issues on top of it.  I used their online filing tool last year, so you wouldn't you think that I should be able to log on to my HR Block account, and download last year's information?  Well, you can't unless you have the information saved in a .13TB format (HR tax format!  I had a PDF saved to my computer, but I would have to load the information manually.  I was told (after being on hold forever!) that the online version and the downloaded versions are two different software programs, and they can't read the other.  That seems totally ridiculous t me.  So, they agreed to refund the charge for this software (sending me a form that I must complete and return to them in the mail), then wait 4-6 weeks for the check to arrive.  I always try to save money, but I think I'll just pay someone next year to do my taxes so I can drop off the information and walk away, as this is all too much stress for me.  Why we don't have a simple tax system in the US is beyond me...I can't wait to get this done and go have a drink!  Also, the online version is more expensive and you only get to file one return per payment (account)....so screwed there too!"
1,"Adobe has disabled a few things since I last used Elements a few years ago. Still great for the price, but I sure miss some of the full Photoshop features."
1,"I had absolutely no problem with this. I've used TaxCut for several years now and found this software to be easy to download and easy to use. The instructions for finding the \\""keycode\\"" were right there as I was downloading. I'll definitely use this product again next year!"
0,They got me this year - a big upgrade charge after I bought the same package I always bought. But I'll chose a different tax software package next year. Its not the product it once was and I don't appreciate the unfair surprise
1,I have Norton 360 already installed and it would not accept the new code.  I then opened the install instructions and clicked the link that was provided through amazon.  Logged in to my account and  It installed quickly and works like a charm.  After install it found the old version of 360 and updated it. Really happy since I paid $25 and Norton initially wanted $80 through them!
0,"OK, I am all set to file my taxes, and there is NO KEY code on the order invoice. So I can't submit the return. The software on screen instructions indicate the invoice is where I would find the code as this was a digital download."
1,I'm very happy with Office 2011. It was easy to download and was everything I hoped for. It works great!
1,For the most part the program is user friendly and very easy to use.  The graphics are clean and clear and the categories are organized well.  There are a few changes from the previous version.  The only issue is with the reconcile process.  It is not a clear process and takes a little getting used to.  I prefer the reconcile function in the previous version.  I am hoping the process will become clearer and easier over time.  Overall I like the new version and would recommend to a friend.
1,"We love this program!  To be able to enter our receipts on the fly with our smartphone or tablet keeps us so much more organized!  I would highly recommend this product, even if you are already using Quicken!  This is worth the cost of the upgrade!"
1,"I have been using Quicken software for many years and they continue to improve year after year. Currently I am tracking over 10 bank accounts, 20 plus credit cards and numerous brokerage/investments accounts. As well as a number of rental properties.<br /><br />This software seamlessly ties into your banks and financial institutions making downloads automatic and effortless. Also the latest version now shows you your current credit score. For anyone that is interested in tracking and monitoring your finances, this software is a MUST.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it without hesitation."
0,"This was 1/3 the cost of the Turbo Tax equivalent, which I had to buy.  I bought it to fill out an unfamiliar 1041 form.  I was expecting it to ask for my numbers, and it would fill them out.  It turned out not to have such an app available.<br /><br />Instead it showed me the forms and expected me to know what numbers went into which boxes.<br /><br />Turbo Tax does not expect me to be that smart.  So I spent $40 plus on H&R, then still had to spend $120 plus to do the work."
1,"For Christmas 2012, I started as a complete novice to the piano, never having played and not able to read music. However, we bought a piano and no teacher lives in our town so I decided to try out a virtual teacher.<br /><br />I bought and then immediately downloaded this app. That was easy to do. The app is set up so that there are lessons, then reviews of the lessons, and a continual build up of information based on previous lessons.<br /><br />The app provides as much, if not more, hands on exercises as thought exercises [like reading notes and learning to read sheet music]. She is very clear that it's best if you keep playing the early tunes until you master them before moving on.  It's important that you also purchase a midi cable that is compatible with your piano and your computer so that the app can track your playing, which is a very cool aspect of the app.<br /><br />I didn't realize that the app could do that at first, so I didn't have the midi cable plugged in. Again, this is not recommended [by me] because the app tracks your music as you play it, and it turns the sheet music as you play, in later lessons.<br /><br />In about 3 months, this app took me pretty far down the road in that I can now play simple tunes and I can read some basic sheet music. It also very much tries to ensure that you understand that posture, fingering, etc is important. So I definitely recommend it for these purposes.<br /><br />In regards to the songs, I recognize that many of the tunes they include are no longer copy righted so many of the songs are very old fashioned. Some I really enjoyed and a few were just didn't work for me. Overall, I would say that the music selection is very workable and many of the songs are catchy and pleasure to learn and play- although definitely not all of them. To me, this is not a major drawback.<br /><br />Obviously, it can't judge you on your fingering, posture, etc. So this is where a piano teacher [a live one] is invaluable.<br /><br />One year later, in Dec 2013, I find that my schedule and discipline means I've only gotten through about 2/3 of the lessons and I still highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to get to a place where you can play tunes, read music, and have a great underpinning about the piano, this is definitely a great buy. I just think at some point a live piano teacher will help you go further [and probably correct any flaws you picked up]. Definitely recommend.year later, in Dec 2013, I find that my schedule and discipline means I've only gotten through about 2/3 of the lessons and I still highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to get to a place where you can play tunes, read music, and have a great underpinning about the piano, this is definitely a great buy.

0,It will cost you almost $40 to get your state version along with the cost of this product.  You are better off getting the Fed / State version combined for $49
0,Somewhat difficult to install. No option for multiyear license.
0,"App is very nice, but a few more things would be nice. For example when working on the mobile app you can't enter split transactions. Also been having problems with syncing desktop to mobile app. When syncing all the accounts balances change. So haven't synced until figure out what problem is. Other than that it is good program and I really like it."

I always had brought the \\""Plus State\\"" one in the past, and I know you have to pay something more in there (15.99 or 19.99) somewhere during the eFile process.  Without buying the Deluxe (which I need zero deluxe features) PLUS STATE - without that software, H & R charges around $36 for the State software to be added as you go along, plus another 15-20 to file.. plus I'd already bought the at Home Basic plus Fed.. ridiculous and feel duped by H&R, though I'd used the deluxe plus fed and state previously for years.  Please don't make the same costly choice I did - I wish there'd been a warning before.  That said, did it, and got my refunds from both state and fed in about a week.  Easy Peesy.  Only issue in filing was that it was difficult to find my Key Code, since I'd done the online download - had to call H&R cust service - they were great and showed me where to find it in my Amazon account Digital Downloads link.  Glad to get the money back, but feel gyped about the 36+15 on top of my Amazon software purchase."
0,"it is a little confusing for me, I would like to be able to track my day to day spending and have never figured that out."
1,"Simple product, but it &#34;just works&#34; and integrates easily with my prior years' turbotax, as you simply point it to the prior return when it asks, so it pulls in your ss#'s and dependent data and you don't have to re-enter them..."
0,The wording in the advertisement is misleading. You can download and e-file federal. It doesn't allow me to download a state product without paying an addition $45. The write-up makes it sound like one state product is free that you can then print but doesn't appear to be the case as every time I try to work on it it takes me to their purchase page. Long time Turbo Tax customer but will move over to HR Block next year with incredible increase in state filing cost and misleading advertising.
1,I have used Turbo Tax for ten years for my personal income tax both state and federal. We Itemize our deductions and while we have not always gotten a refund - no fault of Turbo Tax- we feel we always have gotten all the deductions we were entitled to and some we might have missed<br />doing it ourselves. It has always been extremely simple and clear to complete and file our taxes and get our refunds direct deposited into our bank account. The price is well worth the product. Will continue to be an avid supporter.
1,This our 6th year using Turbo tax and each it gets better and easier.  I do taxes for several family members and love that you can do several returns using one product.  Our taxes are pretty simple but Turbo makes is so easy that some family members use tax time as get together.  We all bring something for supper and do our taxes together.
1,"I bought and download the Acrobat XI Standard software and loaded to my PC within a couple of minutes.  Once the software was uploaded, I used it to confirm its status and ability.  This software works GREAT!!!!  It's extremely simple to use and very functional for my business needs.  I'm extremely satisfied with the Acrobat XI Standard software and I would suggest to anyone needing software for PDF requirements to spend the money and get this; for me it's a business investment, not an expense."
1,"Great product, easy to use. Don't need to be a tax expert, just answer questions and you're done in no time."
0,"I have used Intuit products for over 16 years, in the past they were stable, reliable, and most of all in terms of techno-speak, bullet proof. This release of Quicken however is substandard compared to past releases. After upgrading from a prior version (2010), everything was fine the first time I used the program. When I opened the program for the second use, my data file had been corrupted. Never mind the several hours of lost productivity, the tech support was, well, ridiculous. I like to play non-tech on the phone with tech support calls, even though I am a 25 year seasoned researcher in telecommunications infrastructure.  The reasoning behind this stealth maneuver is that I want to hear what they say without bias. In this situation however when I was told the reason my data file was lost was due to my computer malfunctioning, this thought came to mind; hummmmmm, I don’t think so. Regardless, we went through the data validation/repair to no avail. I will just have to rebuild from the last known good data file copy (the original 2010 conversion). I was not happy. So thinking that possibly there could be a machine problem, even though I have built my own since 1984, I loaded the program on a different machine, different OS, different everything (well, so much for the EULA!). To no surprise the same thing happened on the second machine. The moral of this story, if you insist on this version of Quicken, when you open your file before you enter data, validate/repair and backup. When you finish your work, validate/repair and backup. Do you see a pattern here? Good luck!"
1,Turbo Tax is the only way I would do my own taxes.  I like the free Fed filing that comes with the product and I feel comfortable that taxes are accurate with this product.
1,"Quicken 2015 works very well to keep track of all your finances.  However, there are not many changes from the 2014 version. The only thing I notice is the credit score which is only updated every three months."
0,I am a seasoned software user and found this program cumbersome and frustrating.  I took a 4 week class and still find it not to my liking.
1,software was a piece of cake.  I never used H&R before but start to finish my taxes only took about an hour.  Will use H&R again
1,I have enjoyed Avast since I installed it on my computer. This antivirus program really does work and has protected me from some serious virus and also alerted me when something was array in the file that I downloaded.
1,Very happy with this antivirus scanner it's fast n accurate. Also can cover 3 pc's under one account. Great price n can download.
1,"This works perfectly on my MAC.  Thanks for bringing the software I use every day at the office, home to my family.  Everything works just as good on MAC as my PC at work.  Kids can do their homework on it and there is no difference that I have found yet.  I highly recommend and the price is great also."
0,"I was planning on buying 2 copies of this software this week for 2 machines, but your shocking price increase from 299 to 399 and the bigger version from 499 to 799, without even upgrading the software is totally unacceptable!    Update: 2 days after this the company contacted me and made good on the old prices. I thought that was honorable. I still haven't figured out how to download both different copies that I purchased and I have not yet figured out how to get everything up and running so I cannot offer an opinion on the software itself."
1,"Overall this is a good product, and one that I'd recommend, but there are some features that I really don't like much.<br /><br />In my original Quicken application, I could customize reports. I don't seem to be able to do that here -- there are 3 different types, and what you get is what you get. Not only that, but there's no way to format the report for printing in a format that works best for you.<br /><br />I've also found that the Help menu is not at all helpful. I wanted to set up a new car loan, and typed in Auto Loan, and got nothing. Had to open each available help topic to find the one that referred to -- you guessed it -- Auto Loans!<br /><br />And, much to my dismay, they have done away with \\""smart\\"" categories (I think that's what they were called) which meant that you could assign specific categories to specific items and they'd always populate that way. For instance, I'm a gamer, and buy a lot of games from an online provider, paying for them with one of my credit cards. When the transactions download, I have to edit the category on each one because they come in as \\""uncategorized.\\"" Not horrible, just a nuisance.<br /><br />And this isn't a specific complaint about the product, but I find it remarkable that I cannot download a QIF file for my mortgage payments from Quicken Loan. Strikes me as odd.<br /><br />But, as I said at the beginning, its a good product. I will continue to use it, and have recommended it in the past to others. And am likely to continue to do so."
1,"Easy to download, install, and updates to the virus engine and definitions are made &#34;automagically&#34; after you are prompted that updates are available.  I have used the free version for many years and have not had issues with other software or viruses."
0,This product has problems on my computer. the home page is blank. I've not found a way to fix it
1,"How can we survive without this app? Works incredibly well and has already saved time, but added to our refund."
0,"All I can say is BUYER BEWARE.  Yes, the program is nearly the same as Turbo-Tax and easy to navigate.  However, after finishing both Federal and State forms, it found an error that could not be corrected by myself.  I contacted the Customer Support Staff and they recommended that I wait a few days and install the upgrade (the data I previously entered was intact).  Okay, that I did and it transmitted successfully.  About a day later, I received a message that Fed and State forms were rejected because of Error Code 32-FD-F8962-006.  They didn't explain what exactly this error is and suggested I review my returns.  Huh?  Where does one look?  Again, I contacted Customer Support and even they didn't know what this code means.  I Googled the code and it has something to do with improper decimal calculations on Line 5 of Form 8962.  Customer Support said I should switch back and forth between the Rejection Report and the Interview Screen which was no help at all.   I am SO FRUSTRATED!"
1,"Norton finally comes of age.<br /><br />This home product integrates their Symantec Enterprise features, and detections into the home version. Leveraging extensive, powerful hardware in the cloud for superior detections. Norton now has fingerprinting, and can recognize malware before other products get signatures for them!<br /><br />VERY light on system resources, and overall feel of the system. This is Norton like it has never been before!"
0,A guessing machine til the correct answer without any explanation - not good at all. This is simply an electronic cliff note or a text.
0,The old one was bad but this is worse. There is no evident scroll bar on invoices and there is no free support. User confusing!
1,Decent value for the price -- I thought that I was wasting money on the upgrade and also i hate the new interface ... would prefer to have the choice of &#34;classic&#34; mode ... but I'm getting used to the improvements and will adapt.
1,"Avast! Free Antivirus 2014 is hard to beat. Grant you, the platform is a little bigger than some of the other 'free antivirus' programs that are similar and they do hit you up on upgrading, but what you get with avast! Free Antivirus 2014 is worth jumping through a few hoops. Download avast! Free Antivirus 2014 and find out for yourself."
0,"This is the third time trying to post this review. It's being refused each time I try to post so I've picked 3 stars instead of 1. Unethical on the part of Amazon? I'll let you be the judge.<br /><br />This was a product licensed by Mircrosoft to Amazon. I was unable to load the program so I called Amazon. They tried to help but were unable. When the product could not be installed, Amazon refused to take the license back but kept my money. Buyer beware."
1,"I purchased MD over 4 years ago to replace Quicken when I bought Mac computers.  It may not have all the bells and whistles Quicken had, but I don't miss any of it.  I especially don't miss all the fees from Quicken and my bank.  Tech support (rarely needed & usually my fault) is phenomenal!  They respond immediately and give clear, friendly instructions.  I am so glad I went Apple and found Moneydance.  I love them both.  Thanks MD team."
0,"If you are already hooked on Quicken, then you may have no choice but to buy this product.<br /><br />If you are NOT already a Quicken user, don't get hooked. Whatever useful functionality it provides may disappear in the future and  you many find it extremely difficult to access the personal financial information you have stored in the program. It is  impossible to export your full data into any file capable of being easily imported to any other software.<br /><br />Recently, they have eliminated the ability to import data without logging into their web site. Its not clear what data they are grabbing during your download process that requires you to be logged in or how secure that data is once they have it. There may be no danger of someone getting access to your account, but it certainly is an inviting target for hackers."
0,"Outraged when they purposely omitted Schedule E forcing most people to upgrade. Because of the backlash, they reinstalled it. Also charging $20 to eFile the state return is a total rip off, IMO. I mail my state return for that reason. Otherwise the program works fairly smoothly,"
1,"Note: I did not buy this through Amazon, I bought it directly via the company's website<br /><br />After being unable to install Windows via Bootcamp due to optical drive problems, I was able to use CrossOver to install the Steam game Company of Heroes.<br /><br />(I know that there is a CoH for Mac, but that Mac version of the game cannot play multiplayer with the Windows Steam version of the game.)<br /><br />I followed an online guide and installed Windows Steam within the CrossOver environment, then installed the Windows Steam Company of Heroes game within the CrossOver environment. It all went very smoothly and was mostly an automated process. The game runs smoothly on my 2009 Mac Pro 3,1. I am able to play online multiplayer games with friends who are playing on Windows PCs and running the game on Steam.<br /><br />5/5 would recommend."
0,"Turbo Tax is always a good product, but I was surprised after spending $49.99 for it to do my Federal, and State Taxes that I had to pay an additional $19.99 to efile my state tax."
1,"Several years ago I wanted to consolidate all of the hundreds of pieces of paper with recipes that I had collected from friends, at work, etc. that I really enjoyed.  I put them in a binder, but it was still clunky finding things.  I learned about Cook'n from my sister and decided to try it.  It was a pretty new company, but I gave them a try.  I really enjoy the simplicity in entering my recipes, capturing recipes online including photos, etc.  They also came out with an app for my iPhone, and iPad that had a few problems at its inception, but with the new, improved app things are running smoothly and sync well with my cloud account's recipes files from Cook'n.  Now I have my recipes handy to grab whichever device is close to me to find the recipe or search for a recipe that includes an ingredient.  Very good product!"

WON'T SYNC WITH ACCOUNTS, CRASHES MORE THEN DANICA PATRICK AND SLOWER THEN ... well I think you get the point.  6/8/15 ... have the updates helped... NOPE! this program goes down more then a $2 hooker. I'm beginning to think they just paid Russian hackers to develop just to screw with us and eventually take all my money....  FIND ANY OTHER WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR MONEY!!!!  4/4/16 I still hate this program ... full search for something better this year."
1,Having been using Avast free for over 2 years now and it has served me well.  I used to pay for Mcafee and Avast is just as good at protecting my computer but it doesn't slow it down like Mcafee did.
0,"Obviously there is a need to update software as microprocessor design & speed improve, but, as usual with Microsoft,  all the efficient, useful, parts get thrown out and replaced with an apparently randomized set of interface &#34;improvements&#34; for a trendy new look.  What used to take one, or maybe two, clicks now takes three or four, assuming that it's doable at all.<br />I loath the &#34;ribbon&#34; and long for the original drop-down menu. I hate silly little icons. If MS wants to be international, then they should provide a &#34;set language&#34; selector."
1,"QuickBooks very thoroughly addresses any issue a small business may encounter such as different business specific expenses or income.  QuickBooks also has quick look reports that keep the business manager/owner continually aware of the health of the business and where adjustments must be made to continue profitable status.  I recommend this program to any small business owner; it will save lots of time, effort and trouble.  You will not have to worry as to whether govt. reports are accurate or filed on time.  You will not have to worry about whether withholdings are correct.  You will not have to worry as to whether an expense may be getting out of control."

1,Yes it arrived in 5 min after I bought this item and Right away installed and activated with this key.<br />it is good.
1,"It is getting a little complicated for what I use it for, which is bill paying and keeping track of my primary bank account, but works well for that.<br /><br />Excerpt in downloading the Quicken 2014 update to Quicken 2013 it undid the settings is had for using my bank for updating and paying bills.  It had to go in and reset it.<br /><br />Also, in has not fixed the annoying problem with writting checks.  It defaults to online payments between each check and you have to check the box each time you are writting a check."
1,"Easy to use, stores files on my computer and got me good, fast refund."
1,"I love it.  Just like any new skill, it takes patience and practice to learn (check the CyberLink Tutorials YouTube channel), but you'll likely be happy with the product.  Just be sure to have decent PC hardware to make it work its best and prevent some crashing.  I say &#34;some&#34; because there is still some crashing that occurs while using this.  It's a very intensive application, so it's a little expected.  Hopefully they'll work out the kinks with updates, though.<br /><br />Also, I've already upgraded to PD13.  I have only had a couple of crashes, but that was only when I was using NewBlue Titler Pro.  It could be the software, but it could also be my hardware.  I'm uncertain yet.  If I find out exactly what it is, I'll update this review."
0,"my desktop has been completely taken over by adware.  I have tried using the avast system to resolve this, but it has been ineffective.  it is also very user unfriendly. one screen tells me everything is fine, then another tells me I'm not logged in.  I realize that there is no perfect protection program, so there should at least be a way to contact somebody on the phone for help if the program doesn't work.  I don't see that number anyplace. i would not repurchase this product."
0,This version of quicken completely broke the old budget functionality. I have abandoned use of the budget because of bugs and incompatible changes. I can no longer depend on the budget. See [...] before you upgrade!
1,"Been using TurboTax for years and wouldn't change a thing !  Super helpful, walks you through everything.  Very user-friendly and easy to navigate.  I highly recommend this product !!"
0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT  The business management functions are a completely worthless ripoff.  I gave it 1 star because, well, you have to. Oh, and yeah it technically does print an invoice as long as you don't want to customize it by adding more details.  1. Want to print a statement for your customer?  Sure, go ahead. But...  It won't have your company name or mailing address on it. Just the word \\""Statement\\"" at the top.  It won't list any transaction details. Just a cryptic impersonal reference to  \\""INVC 101\\"" (meaning invoice 101, I guess)  You can't customize it, at all.  2. Want to invoice a \\""job\\"" all at once? Cuz, you know, you spent all that time creating a job and entering all the invoice items on the job.  Sorry - no can do.  3. Well, okay, but we can at least make reference to the job on the invoice, right?  Nope.  4. Want to print a receipt for payment?  To quote quicken's live forum web site, \\""There is no receipt printing feature in Quicken.\\"" But they recommend as a work-around that you print a statement instead. I guess that is one option, except, see item 1 above.  To summarize:  Very limited invoicing customization.  No ability to invoice by job (or even refer to a job).  No ability to print a customer receipt.  Customer Account Statement doesn't show your company's name and address and can't be customized at all.  I'm not sure in what context any of that is helpful to running a business, but I consider my money to be completely wasted.  Quicken's attitude toward the product: We've already got your money and we won't make it better or give you a refund.  What are you going to do, switch to MS Money?  I half expect to be ripped off by the no-name programs available on line, not from what I thought was a reputable company.  Bookkeeper from Avanquest is a little more difficult to use, but way more functional for a fraction of the price.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
1,"Mostly good as usual, but the navigation is clunky. If I want to go back one screen, why do I have to start over again at the beginning of that topic?"
0,"Quicken 2015 for Mac has modest ambitions, but that's a vast improvement over its predecessors.  Begrudging acceptance of the MAC world?  Given the limited ambitions, it performs extremely well and is strong in ease of use."
1,Great price. Downloads flawlessly. Works great.<br />(I am required to have more words so I am writing this out which to me is a waste of my time.)
0,"Turbo Tax got greedy and is  now trying to make it right but only after they got caught.  Can't be trusted, changed their products to force consumers into higher level and more costly product to get the same thing as prior years.  I don't care how many free upgrades they offer, they proved they can't be trusted.  My taxes will be filed with HR Block software this year and in the future.  Apparently Turbo Tax figured they had most of the market share and could take advantage of their customers.  The CEO should be fired for such a bone headed move."
1,Walks you through everything and makes it very easy. Used it now for several years and have no reason to change.
0,"Over all, it does a good job to help with the taxes as well as filling them. Over not much has changed in this style or procedure which is nice since taxes are hard enough on their own. I do not foresee any reason why I will not get it next year but if they make radical changes it is possible that I would change my mind."

0,Lost a long time customer by forcing  to purchase the premier version to handle my simple tax situation.
0,"Updates are complicated, take a long time, and don't always work. Runs very slowly on regular Macbook. Personally, I prefer Google Docs or Open Office over this product. Track changes is really the only functionality where it is nice to have Microsoft Word, in my opinion."
1,great free protection--but too frequent ads to upgrade<br /><br />needs more malware protection and ways to fend off phishing<br /><br />and that's it

1,Avast is a wonderful antivirus product. I have tried several but they always lack in one aspect or another. Not so with Avast!
0,Previously when I wanted to change something on a reminder it was a 2 step process.  Now it is a 6 step process and takes several minutes while I follow the many links trying to find the one that allows me to make the change I want to make.<br /><br />Everything about the new Quicken is much more complicated.  I would think that you would try to make everything easier to change so that it could be done in one or two steps - but apparently someone on your design squad has decided that if you make it much more complicated we will be impressed by how complicated it has become and somehow think you are really do a great job.  NOT!<br /><br />Much like a politician.  If we can't impress them with our ingenuity then let's at least baffle them with our horse manure!
1,A very good program for the development of children's creativity and ability to draw. And for adults is also interesting for practice.

1,"I purchased this product to design my master bedroom.  After many hours and a lot of struggle, the results are amazing and I was able to design the bedroom on the computer and then bring it to life by decorating it.  I had no previous experience with any home design software but I consider myself pretty handy on the computer.  However, to draw the plan with accurate measurement was a pain in the butt because the wall builder is not intuitive at all and takes forever to understand how it works properly (the help/instructions are very general and not helpful in resolving specific issues).  At the end, I am happy with the purchase because it helped me creating a great master suite, but if you do not want invest (a lot of) time in it, this product is not for you."

0,"I have been using Outlook as my primary email client for 15 years and have NEVER had so much trouble getting the software to perform correctly as with the 2013 version. I have worked with every version since the one that came before Office XP.<br /><br />At this point I have numerous auto-save drafts filling up my trash folder. Just saw a bunch of emails that I had actually sent earlier in the day show up in the trash. Had to look through my Sent folder to see if they have been sent... apparently not - therefore I look bad and owe a number of people apologies since these were important emails. Thanks Microsoft. Nice of you to leave me hanging in such a big way. Thanks for reminding me how delicious the taste of eating crow is.<br /><br />As if the above problems are not trouble enough, the application hangs and needs to be restarted about 3 times per hour on average. This is on a brand new Lenovo laptop running Windows 7 64-bit. Good luck trying to figure out what APPHANG B1 really means (aside from U R Hosed).<br /><br />I wish I had better news for anyone reading this email but unfortunately you are stuck buying Outlook 2013 (unless you purchase under a volume licensing agreement.)<br /><br />I hope Microsoft reads this review. I suspect they will fix the problem eventually but it seems I will have to abandon Outlook after relying on it extensively for 15 years. Thanks again Microsoft.<br /><br />If you had any other choice as far as the version of Outlook you buy I would say that you should avoid this version like the plague if you intend to use it with Gmail IMAP."

0,"I have had Quicken Deluxe for around 3 months. It is horrible. I won't go into all the problems I have had with it just today's.<br /><br />When you display your check register in newest to oldest transaction order, the balance column becomes worthless. Quicken still totals your balance is some kind of quasi top to bottom format that makes your balance totally worthless. Every bank in America can calculate the balance correctly when you reverse the date order but Quicken can't. You are left to only view your transactions in oldest to newest order then start at the beginning and scroll all the way down to the bottom to see your current transactions.<br /><br />When I contacted their tech support department I found only rude, uninterested people...not very intelligent either, I might add. One guy tried to convince me that if you SUBTRACT a negative 10 from a negative 20, you get a negative 30. Humm....(-20) - (-10) = -10. That's what I had been taught when I majored in mathematics in college anyway! I guess Quicken has changed the rules of mathematics!<br /><br />Finally they finally by telling me that that is the way the product was designed so it is correct. I tried to point out that if my balance is nowhere near correct, how can their product be correct? That was just my opinion, they said. I didn't know you could have an opinion about the correct answer in math. Then they suggested I use a calculator. Why didn't I think of that! Use a calculator instead of Quicken....or at least another vendor's product!"

1,First of all pay $49.99 every month instead of $2000 for the Master Edition its a Bargain!!!<br />Look at it this way: $600/yr per the Master Edition.<br /><br />I don't use all programs but having them gives me the curiosity to learn more!<br />If you check the complete list of software that you have access its insane!<br /><br />I'm receiving constant software updates and that makes me feel very secure.<br />Regards
1,"Been a Quicken User for 25 years, and Quicken 2007 for Mac since about then, I've come to depend on downloads, uploads, and bill pay for all my bank and credit cards. I tried Quicken for Mac 2015 and discarded it immediately. It does not support bill pay. Recently, Quicken 2007 stopped downloading from any of my credit cards. Called Quicken and they said the CC companies have changed protocols,etc. I've never been happy with Quicken and my portfolio information, so I don't bother with that.<br /><br />So: Quicken 2007 is very old, and won'k work on Yosemite. Quicken 1015 won't upload bill pay. What to do?<br /><br />I downloaded a trial version of iBank, exported my Quicken data, dragged it into iBank, and voila! All there. Including my custom categories and the whole 9 yards.<br /><br />I immediately set up access to bank and credit cards. Instantly, they're downloaded. Perfectly. In 15 minutes I had converted my entire Quicken file and set up the downloads (granted I carry only 2 cards) but easy and fast is easy and fast. Bill pay works differently in that you have to open a bill pay window, one payment at a time, but the update was flawless.<br /><br />I was done with everything: categorizing my downloaded records, paying my bills, in less than an hour! I'll hook up my portfolio accounts when I get around to them.<br /><br />Goodby Quicken. You're way behind in the Mac world and frankly, you'll never catch up. You're too Windows-y to really know how to develop good apps."

I couldn't believe it when Adobe said they planned to abandon the CS Suite in favor of cloud software!<br /><br />Now because &#34;cloud computing&#34; is the latest trend, they are attempting to marry powerful desktop software with a subscription model in a way that makes no sense.  High end graphics software is not a SaaS.  Adobe just kicked all their long time customers in the teeth.  If we scream loud enough, they'll have to abandon this ridiculous approach, and get to work on CS7 before they lose their customer base."
1,"Turbo Tax is an excellent tax software package that is user friendly and walks you through the entire tax preparation process in a quick, easy manner,  guiding you through from beginning to end, following the same logic as if you were attempting to do the 1040 by yourself.  My return is moderately complicated and I was able to complete both Federal and State returns in about 2 hours. The printouts provide a great, easy to follow audit trail. The electronic submission was quick with immediate feedback. The software also finds you the maximum amount of money in the process. For example, there are different forms and choices one can make in terms of education credits. Turbo tax runs through the various options and chooses the best one for you. Most of your information is transferred over the following tax season. The price of $50 was very reasonable, considering the alternative of paying for a tax accounting service or a tax accountant. I would strongly recommend this software to everyone and am giving it a 5 star rating."
1,"If you don't have someone else footing the bill for Microsoft office, which is way over $100.00 a copy id you get everything you need, this works great. So why not throw some money towards the authors"
1,"I've used Kaspersky Internet Security for several years now, and have found it to be he best such product for me."
1,"I cannot give this an honest review other than it had good customer ratings and had a TON of things to do.<br />If you really want it you can risk the purchase, Once downloaded and installed, right click it, go to properties and run it in comparability mode. I should have tried that...<br />Amazon is great about returns but I would return ASAP if it doesn't work."
1,Works great with my Mac air.  Just was I was looking for as I use office in Winodws all the time.
1,It does what it's supposed to do.  Easy transaction.
0,"It's hard to get to love a product that wants to take over your computer, does everthing on its own and contains virtually no documentation, except for plowing through the vendor's web site. I was running my backups using Windows 7. All of a sudden, my backups wouldn't run, ...something about being unable to find the shadow volume. After struggling for a couple days, and trying to wade through Microsoft's Windows 7 documentation, I realized that I had installed Norton after my last backup. I turned off Norton, and the backup ran without a problem. Since resolving this issue, the software seems to be protecting my computer and has warned me two times that it has blocked potential \\""attacks,\\"" but what do I know."
0,I downloaded the 30 day free trial..and am wondering is there more if you purchase it?  As I watch videos on how to use it...I do not find the point to point tool...I see freehand...smart tools etc.  I am really wanting more control...and need the point to point tool so I can remove parts of picture with more accuracy.  Please comment if anyone knows...
1,This is the standard Norton antivirus and I got it on the cheap whats not to like? Gives good protection at a reasonable rate I know their are free antivirus out there but I have a good computer not really worth the risk for me.
1,"Overall, Quicken Home & Business is a nice update.  It takes some time getting used to it, particularly if you have an older version, but it works well and doesn't seem to be as prone to crashing as earlier versions."
0,"It's OK - I used H&R Block for 2008 also, so used it again for 2009 taxes.<br />But now (2012 taxes) I'm back to Turbo Tax."
1,This antivirus is excellent.I use it exclusively. Yes I love it. I use the free one.You can pay for a higher level but this suits my purposes.
1,"Very, very, reliable. Used them for years. Never had a virus since I started using their software and their services."
0,"[[ASIN:B00E7X9RUK Quicken Deluxe 2014 [Download]]]<br />I'm not quite decided about this version, I'm still trying to get the photo of my receipt to show up on my computer when I download transactions.  This was one of the reasons I updated to this, I was always loosing receipts.  Other than that I would have to say it's okay, can't really see the reason for the update. Had I been able to have a 30 day free trial I wouldn't have updated."
1,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.....FOR FREE....YOU GET A LOT OF THE BELLS AND WHISTLES !! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
1,This is a simple and less complicated version of Photoshop.  This is a very useful program and a great buy.
1,"Generally easy to understand and input. Links to where things go/went are difficult to identify and navigate, making an understanding of what's happening &#34;behind the scenes&#34; sometimes mysterious. Still, probably best on the market."
1,"I'm not very computer savvy, so I had to use their chat line, and they were most helpful.  It it also helpful if you give them an explanation of your error codes when starting the chat.  I was getting a lot of pop ups, so much that it was even very difficult to purchase this online.  I finally was apply to download, and with the chat line, I had all my problems fixed."
1,Item is exactly as described.
1,"I have used this version of turbo tax to print 1099s for more than 40 contractors with one of my companies, and I was able to print W2s for a completely different company.  This product has good flexibility and gets frequent updates."
1,My wife's computer was running really slow. I downloaded this program suite and ran it. It worked well and is running normally again.
1,"Free Avast Antivirus is worth every penny. I have had no problem with it. It is very easy to use. However, one has to be careful when doing updates as you may unwittingly upgrade yourself to the paid version, which is also very good. Also make sure that you uncheck certain boxes if you want to prevent additional software from being downloaded, such as Chrome, etc. Otherwise, I love it and have been recommending it for years."
1,"This is the first time I had used the downloadable version of Mavis Beacon, and we did have to attempt several times to download it as we repeatedly got an error message from the server.  Once we got it downloaded, we LOVE the program and use it in our school for keyboarding practice.  The children enjoy it, and have become better typists after going through the program."
1,"Order shipped quickly and was exactly as advertised. Norton 360 is the best, but any antivirus works best when installed on a clean system. If you are already infected, reformat and start over, then install 360."
1,Absolutely flawless download. Great download speed (fastest i have seen on my comp to date) Paid for it installed the downloader which took a minute to or two to download and install then clicked download and it was done in about two minutes. Hit install and Turbo Tax installed without issue. I started Turbo Tax clicked on the Black State button and got my free download right away as well. VERY satisfied!
1,Did not need the state. Worked as always
1,"Works pretty well , did help speed up my computer ."
0,"I've used TurboTax since day one and have always been pleased with it. It always included one free state filing but no more. If I find another product that can import old TurboTax data I'm going to switch, may switch anyway!"
1,Most reliable antivirus on the planet! Thank you for you service!
0,"This is a good, basic financial software product. I bought it to replace an old version  of Microsoft Money. Transferring data from Money to Quicken took several attempts as Quicken had difficulty recognizing categories, distinguishing between categories and account transfers and misidentified account types. It probably would have been easier and less frustrating to just start from scratch. Downloading bank transactions appears to work fine, but I'm not convinced Quicken picks up and clears ALL transactions - there are a few that it seems to have missed. I also don't understand why it wants to register the software online at Intuit every time I connect with the bank; it did this when it was installed and I would think once was enough."
1,I should have not needed this but Microsoft ripped me of by not letting me have network access with basic 7
1,The program does very good job using Window 7 Operating system when creating your website from scratch.  This version was originally made for Widows Vista and below.    Con:    Could not use template at all. Maybe because using a operating system that   not recommended for it.    Pro:    Design your website very easy to use. No problems uploading website.      I would differently recommend this product but get newer version if using Windows 7
0,"I have used Turbo Tax for years, but I thought H&R Block would be less expensive. H&R Block program did not work well with last year's Turbo Tax as others had stated. I am in an different situation as I needed an additional state program. The extra cost was expected, but cost more than I had previously paid with TT and I paid a fee to file the extra state also, the total was just over $60 extra.<br /><br />H&R Block was ok, some parts of the program were easy to use and some weren't."
1,Worked great
1,Very solid and reliable product.  It has already stopped several attacks. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.
1,"This software is great. I have kept my Asus laptop virus free since installing it. Best of all, it's free!!"
0,Crashed twice and can't get through the review because of a bug. Frustrated! Will call 800-445-1875 to bring to their attention my displeasure. Next year won't be TurboTax!
0,Very upset that I have a 5-license product that will only allow me to install on 4 devices. This is complete nonsense and Norton's support is completely unresponsive. I have been a Norton customer since 2002 and this is the first time I have had a problem.
1,"Download is a little slow. My own learning curve slows my usage, however I find it very useful and so far as powerful as the Windows Office for Mac."
1,"I give it 5 stars because it did exactly what I needed, did it accurately and I had no trouble figuring out how to do it.  My client sent me a pdf tabular report, basically a list of names and addresses.  He wanted to use the list for a mailing.<br /><br />I was able to convert it to Excel and from there easily imported to my database for data cleanup, standardization, etc.  The OCR worked perfectly with no goofy characters, odd cell formatting etc. That you can get when physically scanning a printed report.<br /><br />I've done this four more times and every time the results were perfect. I only did this process though. I can't comment on more than file conversion."
1,"I used to do my taxes by hand and it was something I dreaded every year.  Going through the encyclopedia that they call the &#34;1040 instruction booklet&#34; is mind-numbing... but no more! I will use TurboTax from now on - filing a tax return is simple, easy, and much faster.<br /><br />I docked one star because I had to pay $20 to e-file the state return. I was under the impression that I purchased the fed and state software PLUS a federal and state e-file. As they say, always read the fine print and read between the lines. From the description above: &#34;Free federal efile is included at no extra charge.&#34;"
1,"It seems to keep our pc clutter free.<br />Other than while periodically updating, it does not seem to slow our pc down at all."
0,I have been using Quicken software since the 1990's and have been strongly supportive of it.  However the versions since 2012 have been equivalent to Beta software (at best).  It is impossible to address all the issues with the product.  My opinion is that Quicken needs a major change in management and programmers.<br />Michael Showalter (shotmt@hotmail.com)  Longtime Quicken user.
1,"I had problems trying to download and install this Program since I already had an old version of it on my computer. \\""That was probably a big mistake on my part since I was basically just upgrading the program\\"" So call Amazon before you buy so you know the best way to handle it even if you have other norton products.<br /><br />I believe all you will need to do in enter the new product key in your old version. I didn't and did the download but I was never required to enter the Product Key, therefore I kept getting a report that my subsctiption was about to expire in \\""XX\\"" may days. (my undersanding is, this reporting only show up if you have 20 days left on you old subscription)<br /><br />Here are the simple steps required to enter a new Product Key (if you have an old version):<br />Open Norton 360 by double clicking on the Norton 360 Icon (lower right, Careful you might have hidden that Icon. Now look closely at the bottom of the Norton 360 screen in small letters click on \\""Renew\\"".  On the next screen look closely again at the small lettering at the bottom Click on \\""I have a key or code to enter\\"" From there enter the product code and follow the instructs and you done.<br /><br />From there I recommend that you update to the latest changes and run a scan on your PC"
0,This is the hardest financial product I have used.  Just get Quicken for Mac and end a lot of head aches  Purchased this download from Amazon.com Amazon would not refund the purchase price but did give a $20 credit on a $50 purchase. If you insist on this product get it through [...]They will stand behind their download for 30 days.
0,Ok.. but not efficient for the blocking the virus. It is doing normal job.  It does auto updates.. ok ok
1,"Installation was extremely fast and drama-free. My Quicken Premier 2012 data file (24 years worth of transactions) converted quickly and without error.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the UI is relatively unchanged from Q12 but that's actually a good thing. Some years back, it seemed that annual changes to the Quicken UI were purely cosmetic and nothing of any real substance changed under the hood, so to speak. Now, it seems, the opposite is true. Intuit isn't fixing what's not broken and is improving and adding features to the Quicken package. That's a good thing; I don't have to re-learn anything.  I can't say that the credit score feature is one that I'll use but cloud sync with iOS and Android Quicken apps works for me without a hitch. Nice. Count me among the satisfied."
1,Very easy to install...awesome program! I recommend it for anyone that needs basic internet security for there computers!!!!!! 2thumbs up
1,Just what I was looking for to help prepare state and federal taxes.
1,"Its great having Office on my mac. I can get work done on my new Mac, and have all my Office documents be compatible with my co-workers that work on PCs. This version runs very smoothly compared to an older version of Office I used to have on my older mac. It does take some getting used to if you're used to using Office on a PC. Menus are structured differently and can take a little time to find things."
0,"Run!  Do not walk.....to the nearest alternative antivirus programming for your computer.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this program immediately highjacked my browser and filled my computer with advertising.  No problem.  I went through all the steps to remove the extensions and add-ons and return my computer to its original browser.  However, in the midst of this process, my computer contracted the ONLY virus I have ever caught on any computer at anytime in any place. And then, just to add injury to the insult of highjacking my browser, this McAfee program never even noticed the &#34;supersaver&#34; malware which was threatening my computer.  I employed the program in scanning my entire computer multiple times.  It never even noticed that my poor computer was now running a temperature of 104 degrees and was delirious.  As a result, I had to purchase &#34;Hitman Pro&#34; in order to remove the malware and the other 70+ additional tracking cookies from my computer.  I am now safely ensconced in the Kaspersky camp and am using McAfee as my newest swear word.  I have never taken the time to write a review on Amazon before.  However, I am writing this in the hope that this review will save you from the loss of your time, energy, and money that I experienced as a result of downloading this program on my computer."
0,"I was happy to get this free and available from Amazon.  My son the programmer has told me about this product for several years.  Initially I thought it would work fine for me, but it got to be a hassle.  It's very similar to all the Windows Office programs I'm used to.  it opened all my old files.  (When I bought a new computer I could not find my old Office disk)  Documents (Word) was pretty straight forward.  However spreadsheets (Excel) were different enough that they were hard to use.  The on-line help is really poor and difficult to use.  While I applaud the group doing this, I finally broke down and ordered a used Windows 2003 disk used on here.  Never done that before, but it worked fine."
1,I purchased it for my Windows 7 Dell PC and I have been using Turbo Tax for several years and it has been great.
1,I have been using  H&R programs for over 10 years. I feel thay are the best on the market. the best support.
1,"It really is unbelievable the things that one can accomplish with this program. Though at times it can run a little slow, that is probably just because of the computer. Great stuff!"
1,Worked perfectly
1,I have been using TurboTax for quite a few years. It is very thorough & easy to use. I just wish the price was lower.
0,"I can't believe I am being &#34;forced&#34; by Microsoft to purchase this! I bought a 3 user 2010 Microsoft Office Home and Student edition. I only used 2 of the 3 licenses. Then I bought a new computer without a cd/DVD drive. I spent over an hour on the phone with Microsoft yesterday and no one could help me with downloading the 2010 program, even though they said the license was good! If I wanted to go through their tech support, I could repurchase the 2010 edition for only $99!!!!! Maybe it is time for some young techies to develop a similar suite with a reasonable cost!"

1,"Go to the paragon web site and get the latest version of this software- Paragon migration OS to SSD 4.O (English)  My story how I wound up using this software great software:  I got the 256 Gig version of this Adata SSD(Solid State Drive for my desk top computer. Once properly installed and operating it ran great and fast-I ran Parkdale speed test and it ran 10 times faster than my old Hard Drive (HD). Strangely I saw no difference in the window index experience but the computer was noticeably running faster.  This is my first rodeo with SSD but not with HD's. The first problem I ran into is that my computer OS(widow vista)did not recognized this drive so it makes the Acronis software difficult to run with this problem. I went on Youtube and found this is a basic problem with these SSD drives, any brand. Anyway I went to YouTube and watch this video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3zSenz4m80 The fellow on this video explained this problem with a Samsung SSD drive and shows how to fix it by using the management features found on windows.  Once I got pass that I down located the free Acronis software per the instructions that the Adata gave. Well that downloaded software did not work. I wasted about 3 hours trying to do that. no dice, I went to Acronis website and down loaded the 14 day trial version of migration software. It down loaded fine and the software worked fine without using any codes and such. With the trial version I migrated my HD data to the SSD, no problem.  I used the 2nd HD slave space on my computer instead of the USB port to install the migrated data because I didn't have the cables and adapter to connect this SSD drive thru the USB port. It copied my main HD drive in about 20 minutes- sweet. I was replacing a 500 Gig drive with about 130 gigs of used space on it. I was expecting the migration software to fail but it worked okay. It transfer the data from larger Gig size HD to the smaller Gig sized SSD.  It should not be that hard to do, but it is. HD memory have always been a pain to install so SSD's are not any different. I spend about 8 hours messing with this drive by going to researching different web sites,watching different YouTube videos and just manipulating this drive. The next installation should take about 20 minutes or more. My suggestion to the Adata manufacture is that they should provide the instruction with a detailed video on YouTube for rookie like me-showing from unwrap to final operations including the drive manage features of window.  Anyway have fun. I used an old computer I had to test this SDD to see how it worked. It was worth the hassle. I have other newer computers I need to install SSD;s it will be snap to do now that I understand the procedure. Next time I will buy a SSD that comes with a kit with USB cables included for migrating my Lap top computer HD to the SSD. Asked the vender if this one should come with the USB cable adapter if you are upgrading your laptop or where you can get one.  Second purchase( 8 months later):: This time for my computer with a OS windows 7 and with a I,000 gig hard drive I bought this same drive again because it works and I thought it was going to be a piece of cake. How wrong I was The acronis software explained that it would require several boots to clone the drive. So I let it do it's thing. It didn't work properly. It copied the part with the operating system and finished there. It did not boot several times only once so it finished there with 30 gig formatted on that drive. I perform the same thing several times and the same thing happen. I went to the manage part of windows and viewed the SSD and it was split in two different Volumes. messed with the volume's.. I later found out I should have just extended the volume to attach them together. Somehow I thought I had lost 18 Gb of the SSD by messing with the volumes . So the SSD drive now has 238. shown in windows disk manger instead of 256 Gb. The bios still shows it has 238 Gb This was strange so I check several help blogs in the internet and found this is a normal size memory that windows lets you see for a 256 SSD  The missing 18 Gb is hidden doing some other work that the SSD needs to do. So I decide to go with that size memory.   I looked for another migration software and found one called Paragon Migrate OS to SSD 4.0 English. Paragon some bad reviews on amazon but I decided to give it a shot. It cost 20 buck for the password to unlock their down load. I selected the 64 bit version and used that. I installed that and used it. It worked like a charm. What I liked about this software is that it does not required you to reboot for the software to  do it's thing. A window appears and the progress is shown there. It does it's thing until it is complete. No reboots until the work is completed.  This is my main desktop computer and it works great now, again 10 times faster. This computer has a small power supply (220 watts). I check the load to see how that was. It normally draws about 77 watt at idle mode now with the SSD it is drawing  63 watts. So it used about 14 watt less. With use on different loads the 14 watts savings stay about the same.  I found that the paragon migration performed a better job that Acronis.In fact windows perform excellent using this software, The other computer that I used acronis- the windows is a little unstable when it boots and during operations I lose windows every so offend. It just a redundant old computer I have so it's not that important to me. It was having this problem on the original drive so it must have been an existing hardware or software problem. I just used this computer as a test platform so it's okay. So mission accomplished on the second drive using paragon software.  Next:  I will remount the first SSD I bought into my new laptop with windows 8.1. First I Migrated software using the CD port of the laptop to the SSD. Paragon migration worked fine. The SSD is now installed and running on my laptop. Missionaccomplished. Windows 8.1 is running as fast as windows 7 when using the mouse and keyboard. The touch screen is as fast as a Microsoft Surface Tablet. Sweet.   In conclusion- Paragon migration OS to SSD 4.O (English) software saved the day. I am glad I bought this product"
1,I have used Quicken for years and happy with it.
1,Very nice software package. I have had no problems. Runs in the back ground with no interference with normal operation
1,"I stumbled on this software several versions ago and could not believe it contained so many aspects I care about....special effects, tracking, compositing and much more under one roof.  I use After Effects and this program resembles that.  Honestly I use lots of different software partially to inspire new techniques of doing my work, partially because I insist on filling my productions with new perspectives beyond footage...and perhaps I am a software ho. I was suspicious of HitFilm partially because the name, at the time, seemed a little cheap but it turned out to be the better part of a dream...and it keeps getting better.  There is a learning curve for each thing it does, which means there is a a lot of learning curves but there are good tutorial videos available.  I don't give anything 5 stars so this one did get my highest rating."
1,"I love the video editing software.  It just seems they designed this software for someone not too smart, like me, and lazy.  It just seems to work without having to study.  I just want software to work with out me having to get a PDH to use the software.<br />I did the digital download from Amazon.<br />I did upgrade to X7 version and then I did order a DVD so I would have the software here if I ever need to re-install.<br />I use VideoStudio X7 to edit videos that I put on YouTube.  I have over 300 videos on YouTube.  Most of the recent videos have been edited with Corel VideoStudio.<br />One of the features you get with VideoStudio is Corel Video Screen Capture.  It is excellent.  It is the best screen capture software I have used."
1,"I agree the 2014 Deluxe is not the same as previous years.  However, I read Bob's suggestion to call 800-445-1875 (8am - 8pm EST M-F).  I explained my tax return needs to the nice woman and she upgraded me for free.  Hopefully TurboTax will change their product features back into Deluxe for next year, but for this year I can confirm that TurboTax is not being a Grinch!"
1,"Have used Quicken on our Windows PC for years, but last year when we changed to our MAC, Quicken Essentials was the only thing available but it didn't work for our business needs. Quicken for MAC 2015 is terrific. I was able to set it up and import all my old data."
0,It was okay but slow
0,"It works fairly.  I have not found what was improved.  For my use, it seems like changes have been regressions.  There is not a summary of downloaded transactions.  The display is bulky and looks like a beta screen that is waiting for the finalization on the functionality of the software before they work on the visual display.    What works is transactions do download and transactions subtract and or add correctly to the balance."
1,GREAT ICLOUD TO BE USE TO CARRIED ON YOUR HANDSET NOT USING DATA AT ALL!
0,Lots of hidden fees.  Was frustrated to see that the original cost was almost triple due to filing fees.  Ugh!
1,I love TurboTax. I love not having to pay someone to do my taxes. Only I have my best interest at heart.
1,This is great introductive products and hopefully they keep updating fast so bad boys can not reach their fence. Good job guys.
1,"I have been using Turbotax since the mid-nineties.Very easy to file an amended return, great program! I hate doing taxes almost as much as paying someone to do them for me."
1,Like the product!! I had to buy it for school so i did and it was easy to download and install.
1,"I have used this product for many years.  They have added new features to this version.  There are tools that allow you to maintain your computer, easily.  This is a good choice for those that are not computer literate.  The system installs and updates easily.  from there it can be pretty much hands off.  It will tell you when something needs to be done.  There is system optimization that will clean up and defrag hard drives.  It can recognize the difference between hard drives and solid state drives (if you are on Window 7 or later) so it handles them appropriately.  Another nice feature is a history screen that lets you know when computer events took place.  i.e. downloads, virus scans, detection of issues, etc.  You can click on an event and see the details of what it recorded.  I have used Norton quite a few years on several computers and have never had a virus issue on any of my computers.  This version does a lot more in total system maintenance and is a good buy."
0,"Why? Because the &#34;import&#34; function for the &#34;Business&#34; module will not allow import from Turbo Tax Business files. So any sizeable small business, with multiple assets and existing depreciation schedules etc., will be sheer torture to enter by hand. Thanks for nothing HR, back to Turbo Tax for three times the price."
0,I purchased Office 2010 H&S a few years back and installed it on 2 devices. One died so I got a new Dell with Windows 8.1. Tried to install my &#34;purchased&#34; Office 2010 H&S and was informed that my LAK was &#34;blocked&#34; and &#34;not eligible for FREE download&#34;. FREE? I already paid for it. Now you want me to buy Office 365? You guys are funny...
1,Solid piece of software that makes taxes less painful. I've been using for many years. Efile gets your refund into your account quickly.
0,"I'm surprised that there are not more programs designed for the creation of a comic book.  This program is really designed for kids, not true artist or comic book creators... but it is easy to use and has a couple features that make it worthwhile for using to make comic books.  I can't complain too much about it as it was a great price, it does some of what I needed it to do with layouts and text bubbles, but it is really intended to be for children."
1,"This product has worked extremely well, as have all previous 8 editions purchased. Norton keeps my system tuned up and running well without concerns about malware and viruses. This 3 pc pkg is a great value!"
0,I did not understand it.
0,"I've had Norton for about a year because I was having problems with my computer and i thought after getting this it would help, but still got hacked."
1,I have used H&R Block for many years. It is an extrememly user friendly program without all the bells and whistles that sometimes get very confusing and distracting. The prompts are easy to follow and with the state program you just sit back and follow the direction for a smooth and stress free tax program. The free E-file for the federal is just another added plus.
0,"This software makes a good map and route planning tool. I decided on a trip in California. It gave me the information to plan and transverse the route complete with hotels, rest areas and attractions. Problem it didn't work with my Microsoft GPS device. It would never install. I read other reviews that had the same problem. Without GPS the software is nothing more than a planning tool."
0,"I HAD USED NORTON 360 FOR YEARS; HOWEVER, WHEN I PURCHASED A NEW COPY FROM AMAZON.COM, I COULD NOT ACCESS THE ACTIVATION CODE. I CONTACTED THE SUPPORT LINE, WHICH PROVIDED ME WITH ALL KINDS OF USELESS INFORMATION BUT NOT MY CODE. I WAS TOLD AFTER TEN MIMUTES THAT  FOR A ONE-TIME FEE OF $100 I COULD GET ALL THE HELP I NEEDED. WHO IS AT FAULT: NORTON OR AMAZON?"
1,Word 10 has a hard time converting some files and I couldn't open them.  OpenOffice will fix you right up!
0,I purchased this software back in October 2011 and have been having issues with invoices the numbers show up wrong and negative and i have communicated with customer service for the past year. They stated it will be resolved in the next update like a broken record to no avail it has not been fixed yet. I contacted them on August 31 2012 they refuse to let me talk with a supervisor about this continuing issue.  Don't buy this software it is nothing but disappointments. this software should get negative stars you can not run a business with the wrong numbers its a nightmare to keep track of.
0,"The people giving this anything more than worthless must be HR Block plants, or are not using the business side of the software.

1,Avast is the best of the best! 5 thumbs up!
1,"Seems to work well for me. Have had success in the past.<br />It is absolutely stupid to require more words than the reviewer wants to use. If this requirement remains, this will be my last review."
0,"I would give it negative stars if I could.  I've used Quicken for Windows since the 1990s.  Since I've used a Mac since 2006, I thought I'd finally try Quicken for Mac.  It borders on unusable.  It's crashed multiple times since I downloaded it.  It won't import transactions from my bank.  I have been able to import transactions from credit card accounts, but it won't upload the bank transactions, although it says it'd doing it.  The file conversion from Windows to Mac was smooth, but the categories in the Mac version aren't identical and the user interface isn't as easy to read or use as the Windows version.  It's sluggish and it keeps crashing.  Intuit's customer support appears to be non-existent.  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this product.  It was a waste of money and I wish I could return it."
0,"I just downloaded it today. First step, you need to create a new account in the program.  I wrote down my password on a piece of paper and entered it twice in the application.  When the system automatically re-started, it asked for my password again.  I entered it 10-20 times said my password was WRONG and won't let me in!!  I am 100% positive I entered the correct password.  I &#34;chatted&#34; with a H&R Block representative and there is NO way to change your password unless you have the original password!  NONE!  They told me you need to download the entire program all over again.  I tried 3 times to download it again, but it won't let me in again since the password was still stored in my computer from the first try even after deleting &#34;History&#34; and &#34;Cookies&#34;.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,Without a doubt both on (and especially on) the free version and the retail paid for version this is by far the most thorough and secure security solutions available which  I have used and recommend with an easy to setup & understand menu for beginner and professional users.
0,"I bought this because it said it would download all my information from my bank and credit cards, but it does not.  It only supports a small percentage of banks.  I found that my bank supplies Quicken QIF files, but Quicken doesn't support them any longer.  That only leaves me with manual entry which defeats the reason I bought this.  It would have been nice if they were forth coming with this information before I gave them my money. Talk about bait and switch...<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I suppose that if I entered the information manually it \\""might\\"" work well.<br /><br />Never again!<br /><br />I should add one more thing...<br /><br />While trying this out, I transferred funds from one account to another and that worked as expected. I then deleted the transfer (I was experimenting) which removed the entry from the account I was transferring from, but it didn't delete the transaction that I transferred the money to.  Needless to say, if I hadn't looked, this error would have remained.<br /><br />You might argue that, in the real world, a person would never delete an entry from the books, but would instead make an adjustment entry to correct the problem, but this isn't high finance and most people that are new to this would assume that deleting an entry would be permissible.  A properly written program would have prevented me from deleting the entry (in this situation), or informed me of the entries that this deletion would have affected.<br /><br />I realize that I'm being rude, but a person would think that after all these years, Quicken would have crossed its \\""t\\""'s and dotted its \\""i\\""'s if you get my meaning.<br /><br />I hate giving a negative review, but I expected better."
1,Very good program. It does the same as MS Office with out the price tag.
0,"I had been using Quicken 2010, and was \\""forced\\"" into changing when informed UPDATES for Accounts was going away.<br /><br />I would have responded a few days ago, and at that time would only have complained about the speed change.  This new version is S-L-O-W, taking several minutes to return after having to mess around with the database.  I have a lot of history, over 2 Million records, but compared to Q-2010 this new version is a DOG!<br /><br />The WEB App sounded good, but is little more than MINT.  Now, I haven't tried to enter transactions from my tablet, but I can't get any reports of forcasts of my account balances, which is what I use most.<br /><br />Today, I tried to install Quicken-2013 on my laptop so I can monitor account balances while traveling.  I had my previous 2010 version installed and would just carry the data file on a Thumb drive.  The install found the old version of the program, removed it, then died.  I have un-installed and re-installed 2013 numerous times, and the install goes fine until I try to RUN the installed product.  It dies immediately, so quickly I can't even read the error message.  It is completely useless for use on the road, and the WebAPP is not a replacement just a neat toy like MINT.<br /><br />Too bad MS Money is no longer available, it was never this bad and did things in the Planning area that Quicken doesn't."
1,"Moving my furniture into my rental apartment and my office was a breeze, because the entire room was planned in advance. Everything fit. I could use the 3D view to get a sense of whether I liked the arrangement, not just whether it fit. It also helped me to decide what to keep and what to give away--before the move, not during!<br /><br />I paid for my download to thank the developer, even though it is free online. The downloaded version is much better. I just put the files in OneDrive so I can share them between computers."
1,"I was a little wary of purchasing a downloadable book, I am new to this computer thing, but have to say this was so easy and it is incredibly easy to use Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013. Plenty of tutorials and how to's."
1,"I went to Avast because my daughter had it and was very pleased with it.<br />I have now had it for about 4 months and am extremely happy with the results, I've never had any issues since using it and I get regular updates to say that my system has been checked and is in perfect working order.<br />I would highly recommend it to other computer users and would give it a 5 Star rating"
1,I love Word! No problems with it ever!
1,"If you are doing your taxes any other way, you are missing out. I have been using TurboTax for at least 10 years and every year it gets better. It is so easy, and if you use it year after year, it gets easier because it finds your last year's return and imports the info. Now, I don't own a business, but everything else you can deduct I have seen. Simple, fast, accurate... what more do you want?"
1,"This was the first year I bought the edition that had the bonus refund offer. Next year I plan to buy same offer if it is extended again. I buy from Amazon anyway, so why not treat myself to a gift certificate from my favorite online store."
1,"I tryed Envelope Printer for about 90 days before I bought the program, having to re-type your address information every time I needed it was not easy. After buying the software I no longer have to re-type all the address informatio, and the ease of use was also a major factor requirement. And I have had no issues using the program over the Wi-Fi network where we have 4 computers accessing the software through the day."
1,Easy download and great program.
1,"i'm very happy with it so far. I'm using the outlook more often then the rest but it is exactly what i was looking for. to download the software, it was easy breezy and no problems. i would highly recommend this product to someone who wants to have outlook for any small business, or email formatting, and also for the office programs."
1,I too got burned by TT and decided to try H&R Block.  We have been doing our own taxes for twenty years using TT for most of that time. H&R Block works just as good at a lower price.  We will buy H&R B next year.
0,"can not get passed the password infor at the start of the program and if you do not get passed the password you cannot use the program, I tried 25 times on 2 different computers. every time I tried to reset the password I got wrong, I would like my money back but on downloads working or not you loose"
1,"As expected and more. The convenience of storing documents online is a great idea, provided security is as expected from Quicken."
1,"i use this soft for post procesing my digital photos, and it is a very good replacemtn for phtoshop cs6."
1,"I've used Quicken Windows since its inception.  When I bought my Mac two years ago, I bought Mac Essentials.  It was terrible, and I never used it.  I was leery about Quicken for Mac 2015, but I tried it.  It's great.  I used the Quicken converter to format my data from my Windows program.  The data transferred easily and completely.  The only think I had to do was reenter my account user names and passwords, and the interface for that was excellent.  The only thing that did not transfer over was my saved reports.  Now that I've had time to use Quicken for Mac 2015 and compare it to Quicken Windows 2013 I've cut my rating from 5 stars to 4.  I compared the two - Start up - Mac slightly quicker. Opening account - Windows, you can specify the account you see when the program opens.  Mac, the opening programs is the one you last used when quitting the program. New transaction - Windows, the cursor is already at the date for a new entry so you can start entering data with no delay.  Mac, you have to initiate a new transaction before you can enter data; you can click on the + symbol or press command and n. Update time - for me Windows updated 20 seconds quicker for seven accounts; however, Windows requires a password entry.  Mac though slower only requires one click.  So, up to this point I would still rate Mac 5 stars. Update data -  This is the big difference between the programs.  With Windows, the newly downloaded transactions appear in their own box.  Each one is listed with its own status - new, match, mismatch.  You can accept the new transactions individually or together.  The important thing is the program alerts you to a mismatch between the amount of a check you already entered and the one downloaded, giving you the opportunity to correct the error.  With Mac, new transactions appear in the register itself with a blue dot to show they are new.  You have to clear each blue dot individually rather than accept all items at once.  More importantly, the program makes no effort to alert you to a mismatch.  Conclusion for me, I'm sticking with Quicken for Mac because my main computer is an iMac.  I rate it 4 stars because I know it could be better."
1,"Previously had Trend Micro, but was messing up my internet and files.  Bought a new laptop and put Trend Micro on it, did the same thing on the new laptop.  Uninstalled Trend Micro on both laptops, but Kapsersky on both laptops and has been working great!"
1,"I am currently using Dragon speech to write this review. I was a little hesitant to buy the downloaded version of Dragon speech because people were giving it bad reviews saying that it wasn't working for them. Fortunately for me, it is working like a charm. It has about 95% accuracy, and I'm talking very low into a headset microphone. I've been waiting a long time for a product like this and I'm so happy that I found Dragon speech. I will now be able to take notes on my readings for class without having to type them all up which takes a long time. If you type a lot of notes for class or you have a lot of essays to do this software will make things easier for you."
0,With Quickbooks Intuit will help you manage your money and take as much of it for themselves as possible.  The software package is an advertisement to get you to purchase additional services from Intuit and as a side note it allows you to manage your books.
1,"Why would I need Lightroom if I have Photoshop? What about Bridge?  I read reviews and watched tutorials and found Lightroom is a great way to pre-edit photos without taking up a lot of hard drive space and it is an alternative to Adobe Bridge.  It's Snapshot option preserves a moment in the history of the edit.  Since it is all virtual the stages of edit take up no noticeable drive space.  It's History option has every change made from the start of the edit.  Several presets save time: iris enhancement, face sharpening, skin softening, teeth whitening plus many more built in presets as well as available third party presets.  As all good editing programs there is a learning curve but there are plenty of Adobe, Lynda.com, and YouTube tutorials available that get you going quickly.  Lightroom reads my Panasonic Lumix RAW (.RW2) files which Adobe CS5 Bridge and Photoshop do not (Adobe CC Photoshop and Bridge do read my .RW2 files).  RAW files can be converted easily to .DNG format which holds the same information as the RAW files but Lightroom saves the conversion step."
1,"AM THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THIS SOFTWARE.  I AM NOT FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH EVERYTHING THAT IT DOES, BUT WORKS WELL FOR ALL THE THINGS I NEED IT TO DO.  THANK YOU FOR A GOOD, RELIABLE PRODUCT!"
1,"I had to buy a new computer, and it runs on Windows 8.  My old copy of Publisher was from 2003.  It was time to update, and I just can't gat along well without Publisher.  Great program!"
0,"I am so sorry I didn't order the disc!  I downloaded from amazon.com and this software took my computer to places I never wanted it to go!  It screwed up my computer so badly that I had to remove it and take my computer to back to an earlier period before it would function without all those error messages, etc..  Do not buy this product!"
1,"Great security product, works great and does not slow up my computer. I highly recommend."
0,"Disaster on the Mac - downloaded fine, on startup it wants to download and update - that's good, download and install the update and the updater stalls saying &#34;gathering information&#34; forever!!!!<br /><br />I thought I was being smart by avoiding the TT brand POS, but looks like - not so much!"
1,Much better than I expected. Stop some viruses and malware.
1,"Uses the least resources and is the most powerful , efficient protection available for the last 9 years that I know of.<br />Amazed it's FREE !."
0,I have been a turbo tax user for 20 years. Last year was the best and this year was the worst ever. There was so many errors and<br />the interview was usually wrong! I ended up going page to page and entering everything. I could have done it faster without Turbo!<br /> I never did find the home deductions.
0,"I started using Quicken a long time ago...my checks were printed on a dot matrix printer!!<br />Quicken/Intuit used to be a great company. They made a good product and supported it well.<br />Now every few years they make some needless changes and force you to upgrade for some extra crap you just don't need.<br />It's too bad to see a great company turned to crap.<br />If there was a better product out there, I'd switch in a heartbeat.<br />Never used MS Money, but I suspect they would force the same updates on you. It's all about the money."
0,Bought so I could use the new android app to sync between my phone and computer. Does not work well. Balances never transfer correctly.
0,"Intuit, you just lost a long-time customer. I already had to return TurboTax Basic, which is the version we've been using since at least 2004, because you downgraded it and removed features. Then after purchasing TurboTax Deluxe, I find out it doesn't include Schedules C, D, E, or F. What a ripoff. You can bet I won't use TurboTax again!"
0,"We're pretty basic users.  No investment accounts or anything like that, just a couple of checking accounts and a savings account.  We have been using Quicken for years just to keep track of our spending by categories.  Since we recently purchased our first smartphones, we wanted something that could keep track of our money on the go, and sync between multiple devices.  Years ago we were using Pocket Quicken on our PDA's and loved it, so we wanted something similar to that.<br /><br />We found the Quicken App on Google's app store, but it required Quicken 2014, and we were using 2011.  We took the plunge and upgraded, and were quite unhappy from the start.  First of all, for some odd reason, it requires us to log in about once a week.  Other finance apps I have tried do not require that.  Second, when I enter transactions in the app, the balance does not change! I have to sync to the cloud, then sync my PC to the cloud, then sync the app again to see the new balance. That completely defeats the purpose!<br /><br />There are other smaller complaints as well.  The app can work with split transactions, but it cannot create them.  Creating a new transaction is less than intuitive, and is a two screen process for some reason. As for the desktop application itself, there were no real improvements, things were just moved around it seems like.<br /><br />The frustration grew so great that I finally decided to get a refund.<br /><br />For those of you looking for alternatives.  We are now using two different apps on our android phones.  For our personal spending we are using GoodBudget, which operates on the envelope system as promoted by Dave Ramsey.  We absolutely love that app!  We also needed to track our Health Savings Account, but need much less detail with that.  GoodBudget wants $42 per year for multiple accounts, which is a little outside our budget ironically. So we're using ClearCheckbook for that.<br /><br />After 15+ years, we're done with Quicken."
1,This came well packaged and worked like it should.I have used Norton for years like the security they offer and support when neededthanks.
1,Quicken Deluxe 2014 was very easy to install. Conversion of existing data to the new version was flawless. Using the software with features that I'm already familiar. New features not yet identified.
0,I have had nothing but trouble trying to install and use this product. It asks the same questions repeatedly after I have complied with the request.  I don't find it nearly as user-friendly and I'm very sorry that I switched from Turbo Tax.  If there's no way to return this to Amazon then I will just have to purchase a second product.
1,"Started out on Windows because we didn't feel the need to pay Microsoft Office. It really helped get all my high school assignments done. Even with powerpoints and spreadsheets. Pretty easy to follow teacher's instructions (even though it wasn't the official Office.) Options are about the same. Then About 4 years ago, when I switched to Mac, I decided to give it another go on my new OS, and I have not looked back since!<br /><br />The only con is that it's not as visually pleasing to look at as the buttons on Microsoft Office. Other than that, it gets the job done and doesn't skimp you in any areas! Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a free way to get projects done! What have you got to lose in trying it out?"
1,"I have used Instant Immersion software before, but it was for Spanish. This Irish version is set up very similar to the Spanish one.  It is easy to follow and a great price for what you get. You will not be fluent by any means, but it's a good starting point."
1,Downloaded fine. Great product
0,"I love the old Word and have used it for years, especially for teaching. All my old quizzes and lesson ideas, plus recipes,  etc have been saved/revamped and used over and over. However..(here it comes) I bought a new laptop this summer and bought the  Home version of Office, too ( computer $ + more $), since new laptops no longer come with Office. I was surprised to learn my old documents, even when transferred, wouldn't open at all unless I also bought the new Home School Office. The files had to be saved to new external hard drive ( computer $ + Word $ + external hard drive $ + $$$$$!) these were then uploaded to the new computer. They were stored in a completely different file which is not a part of the new Word I just bought. I was told the old documents couldn't be added directly to the new ones, so, I now have two Word files-the new one and the old one. I need to leave bread crumbs so I can find what I need! Is the recipe I want in Word A or Word B? Darn! Where is that quiz I typed up? Here, or there?<br />Also, the new Word/Office has way too many choices. Please! Where are the bullets and numbers? I am still looking. do we REALLY need all the pasting options? Please. sometimes simpler is better."
0,"When I got to the file section I clicked on e-file, the screen told me to print a copy of the return for my file. All the time I was using the software it keep telling me to download an update, which I did many times, but the updats couldn't be extracted an uploaded. On 4/16 I checked my checking account to see if the funds were withdrawn, they were not. I reviewed my return only to find there was another screen after the print screen which said my return could not be e-filed because there was an upgrade that I had to download. I tried to do it again but still the same problem. To me this error screen should have occurred prior to the print screen. I called turbotax and was told it was to late to e-file, that it can't be done after 4/15. I was told to print out the return and mai it in instead. So now I am filing late and be penalized for late filing. Then I was told that the missing upgrade was for Microsoft users only and I use a Mac. They had no answer as to why I was required to donwn load it. So, it is going to cost me a lot of money, but Turbotax has agreed to give me free software for next year."
0,This is not a good deal. They have hidden charges on the state level. 40 per State. Pass as you can find cheaper elsewhere!
0,"I have been using Turbo tax for years but I seen this H&R for half the price,  well you get what you pay for. This program is terrible compared to Turbo Tax.  With Turbo Tax you cannot mess up. With H& R's program you can mess up. Turbo Tax ask you simple questions to get your taxes done.  H& R has you decide how to proceed with your taxes.  Check what applies to you???? Just take me though the steps that Turbo Tax does because I not sure what all applies to me.  Just threw away $25 buck because I already activated it.  Most of these people that gave 5 stars must have simple returns with no deductions or healthcare deductions."
1,"Works great as usual.  In spite of the dumb move by intuit on features and their slow response to complaints, it is still a good usable program."
1,"aside from the sexy~ish lady telling me the system is up to date and running, i would never know it. seamlessly running in the background causing little noticeable lag.<br /><br />Great product!"
0,"The product is OK, but I will continue to leave 1 star reviews each year until the greedy #$@%$s file the state returns as part of the package.  I knew before ordering that they charge the $20 to file your state taxes, but for those new to TT, they would assume that the '+ state 2013' means that they file the state return for you.  Nope!  You end up paying $70 total for this product and I don't see anywhere in the description that spells that out for the consumer."
1,"Purchased over the past weekend. Wanted to offer a little help to anyone upgrading from 2012 to 2015. BEFORE you upgrade, remove the password if you have one from your Quicken 2012. Apparently, they use Quicken ID's in later years and it causes a major pain. If you don't remove the password, you get to a &#34;Create an Intuit/Quicken ID&#34; page and you are unable to click on &#34;already have a user id&#34; and just get stuck. I was able to work around the problem by creating an entire new ID and only using the tab key (instead of the mouse) on the problem page. It took about 3 hours to figure out so I'm posting this to help others upgrading."
1,"I moved from spreadsheets and keeping physical copies of my receipts to Quicken 2015. I had heard good things about it for a couple of years and decided to jump to this. I had also heard of Quickbooks, which is the more advanced, extensive and expensive financial management software from Intuit. I had also heard of MINT from a while ago. I didn't want to do everything online so I knew I wanted a desktop version and I didn't need all the features of Quickbooks since I'm not an accountant. So this serves me best. I'm pleased with everything—the layout, the categories, the transaction retrievals, the budgeting system...etc. I just feel that I have a much better and more comprehensive grasp of my finances. My only issue right now is that when I try to attach images of my receipts, the program crashes and has to be restarted. I would really like this to be fixed. I'm a fresh new user (3 weeks of using) so I have a lot more to learn and take advantage of. I would highly recommend this product!"
0,I tried several times to download and it does not install all of it correctly. Waste of money. Company never responded when I submitted questions for help.
1,"like it. it works well and provide good service,also has a good price.<br />registering is simple,easy and more convenient.<br />one more thing, I would like to buy some books but they do not have them, a little disappointed."
0,Product key did not work.
0,Junk!  I went back to Norton Security.
1,it more than met my needs for my current situation. I was at the point of being at the dealine for filing taxes and this software saved me alot time and money. It walks you through every step of the tax filing process. I will be using this until eternity...
1,Always easy and a great product to use for taxes!
1,So far it has been working great for my small 3 person business. I can do payroll and pay liabilities right from the program.
0,The product key does not work!!
0,Did not down load!  Had a problem asked for refund!  Please make sure the refund is done and I am notified!
1,"Have tried other products that promise the same thing, but have been disappointed until now. Movavi proved to be quick, easy and easily manageable. Wish I had discovered it earlier!"
0,We were unable to download this software despite repeated attempts.  Immediately called and asked for a refund and was told we would get a credit on our credit card -which I don't believe we've received yet.  Can you check?
1,"While typing is hard for anyone to pick up I believe this is a challenging fun way to teach it, my son is going into 1st grade and does better when he sits down and does it without supervision. The supervision gets in the way of him learning, tough as it is practice is the only way to move himself forward although practice is met with a not so happy face. Typing is hard but if he gets this now he will be so far ahead of the game."
1,"I downloaded this for my computers at home and as always, it works like a charm.  I would buy this again."
0,"My husband purchased this to make tax season easier, but he found there were a lot of &#34;glitches&#34; and the program made too many mistakes he was unable to fix.  For instance...we have two dependent minor children and he put their information into the program only to find that after entering all the info on them and going to the next screen it kept deleting all the info he entered on them and telling him he had no qualifying dependents!!!  He tried everything to try to fix it, but it is a &#34;glitch&#34; in the program.  Then he tried calling customer service and was on hold literally for HOURS and no one ever did pick up the phone!!!  There was another &#34;glitch&#34; in the program regarding dependent care (daycare costs) and trying to claim that.  He has yet to hear back from customer service.  My husband had to file the taxes without putting our two dependent children on the tax forms and now he will have to file an AMENDMENT to our taxes with all the correct information hopefully once Turbo Tax figures out what they did wrong with this program!!!!  We are just so angry and unhappy with this program!!!!  Next year we will just pay a professional to do our taxes rather than deal with the Turbo Tax headaches again next year!"
0,"I am unable to use this version of Quicken.  It requires updating the operating system of the Mac I am using.  Even after I did that, the program will not update and reconcile Quicken as I used to do on my version of Quicken.  Is there a way to return this program?"
0,It sucks... I wanted to return this after the first 5 minutes of use.  You can't get walls to exact dimensions... really frustrating!
1,"I've been using this product for years. I like the interface and all the features, especially Identity Safe. I recommend it!"
0,"I had issues in my old Office 2007. With the old version loosing MS support, and having to pay MS for support, I thought this would be a smart choice. It has more features and a little different to get use to. Some compatibility issues and setup procedures may have to be tolerated. Once running I like it, but may have wished I had Office 2010 with WIN7 than WIN8 as I have now.<br />Amazon made it simple in the digital download. Also having the licensing on record, it was easy to verify the ownership when it came time to speak to Microsoft tech support on some issues. These new versions no longer need the physical CD as it stays resident.<br /><br />I am updating this review after the warranty ran out a couple of weeks ago. I am also downgrading the product from 4 stars to 1 for good reason. As of recent for no reason, both Power Point and Excel now refuse to open previously saved files. Either it produces an error code 0xc0000022 or says the files are corrupted. Repair and overwriting with Office 2013 does no good as I tried it 8X. So to test, I installed Apache Open Office which had absolutely no problem reading or writing the data that Office 2013 stalled on. There is no fix to be found and Microsoft will charge about $60 to fix it if they actually can. This was the second difficult fix since installed 4 months ago.<br /><br />Save your money!"
1,"Works great on converting flat scans into text and photos. Leaves the text and photos in a word document. I shaved off 1 star for doing a poor job converting white spaces, which cost me a gig converting pdf to text file for my dads business."
0,Like many others I was disappointed to find that I was unable to complete my return with the same edition of TurboTax I used in prior years. The money for the software is already gone but next year I'll use an alternative.
0,"Being online since installing Norton 360 has been horrible, even in Silent Mode. There are freezes, not responding, while I can hear the PC running something that Task Manager doesn't always indicate what it is. Closing, there's always a shut down ccshvst.exe that needs to end that doesn't show in Task Manager. Compared to before Norton 360 is like night and day online. On my way to uninstalling and refund."
1,dependable and free....doesn't get much better than that!
0,Could not find it on my hard drive once downloaded. And then could not figure out how to use it.
1,I've had quicken for years. It's a very helpful tool. The only thing I don't love about it is that you have to update every other year or so. I still continue to use it because it's an awesome program.
1,I purchased this program every year and it is the wonderful program and trustful one to do the job. I like it
0,"I was all set to buy Turbo Tax Basic, until I read the reviews.  I see that Turbo Tax changed the software and removed all the necessary forms for me to do my taxes.  In order for me to file Schedule D, I now have to buy the Premier version of turbo tax.  My price for the software went from $25 up to $80.  What a horrible way to ensure people buy the premier version of your product just so you can make more money.  I am not falling for this.  I am voting with my wallet and will NOT be buying Turbo Tax anymore. When the competition can sell tax software for $35 which includes ALL the forms, offers the same guarantees for correctness, 5 free federal E-files, and unlimited online support, its a no-brainer decision.<br /><br />Turbo Tax, you would have been better off just raising the price for Basic.  Removing features from Basic and forcing an upgrade was in poor taste and a marketing blunder on your part.  BTW - H & R Block converts turbo tax files so they make it really easy to switch."

I couldn't figure out a way to get it to quit without actually terminating the process from via the unix prompt on my mac.  Very disappointing.  It scares me that I have to trust turbotax to get the math right for my taxes.  This may be my last year using turbotax."
1,This product has served my well for over eight years. It is constantly<br />updated automatically on my pc and I scan for bugs religiously.
1,Have been using avast! for about 3 years now and have never had ant virus problems (of which I am aware) Definition and program updates occur regularly but are a small price for a great antivirus.
1,"I've been a long time user of Quicken products for the Mac.  I was disappointed when the products did not stay up-to-date with Apple operating system upgrades. This resulted in me having to use Quicken Essentials.  Although Quicken Essentials performed well, it was not as robust as the full version of Quicken.  My conversion back to Quicken 2015 for Mac is recent.  I hope it proves to perform as well as previous Mac versions."
0,I sat with my boyfriend while he used this software and it was filled with problems.  All of the bugs that are listed in these other reviews were present for us.  We ended up just using MS Word.
1,"I use Parallels to use Windows 7 on my Macs at home for work purposes. I opted to get Office for the Mac, though I usually use Apple's iWork apps for personal use, because my employer uses Windows and Office for most purposes. Mostly consuming, rather than creating content. So for those purposes Office Mac fits the bill.<br /><br />I tried using the free Open Office but had too many issues with it, so I purchased this.<br /><br />A little bit pricey for the amount of use it gets, but it serves its purpose."
0,I hate paying this much to do my taxes but it is a necessity nowadays especially with the complicated tax law regarding rentals and small business.

0,"The problem may be with Microsoft Office, which I as a university professor wanted in order to write a new book. However, the Product Key idea stinks--laborious and nearly inoperable! I tried several times, with Amazon's help, to rectify this situation. I had also ordered a CD or DVD, promised by two nice Amazons. Unfortunately, I ended up with downloads! The immediate problem is that I have been billed for two items. You sent me the return labels, and I returned the hard copy, for which I received credit. My bank showed two Amazon charged, however, and we paid for the item we returned via UPS drop-off. Now please check my account and delete the remaining charge. I have NOT used the download and have tried to delete any remaining icons, etc. Please advise ASAP&#62; Thanks,<br />Prof. Dr. Kenyon B. De Greene<br /><br />PS. I'll review, in some cases briefly, the music, etc. listed below on this email."
1,"I have three major requirements for any software product:  1.  It does what I need it to do and is stable and intuitive to use.  2. That customer service is a huge priority for the company producing the software or product.  3. The product is constantly being improved as technology and users needs evolve.<br /><br />iBank for mac by IGG software meets all three of these needs and more.  More comprehensive reviews are available here and elsewhere on the web, so let me focus on why I switched to iBank.  For me Intuit fell short on all three of my needs, which was the reason I switched from Quicken to iBank several years ago.  The change was not easy in that I was used to the Quicken UI for many, many years and the new look took some getting used to.  But when I contacted IGG support on a weekend and got immediate help, well as you can imagine, any doubts in my mind quickly vanished. The IGG customer support is a huge reason alone to try this excellent product.  The software may be missing some features that us loyal Quicken users grew to love over the years (for the life of me, I can't even remember what those were anymore), but it does the trick for my banking/financial needs.<br /><br />The good thing about human nature is that we are very adaptable - but that can be as much a liability as an asset.  We can adapt to higher and higher standards, or we can adapt to more and more dysfunction.  My expectations of Intuit kept getting lower and lower and eventually I decided that in the 21st century, its wasn't such a wild dream to have personal finance software that adequately met the needs of mac users.  And since the invention of AppleCare, which I think created the gold standard of customer service, I decided that customer service was just as important in doing business with others than the product alone.  I have made the personal commitment to take my business to companies like IGG that are responsive and respectful of the customers.  Mac users do have a choice - granted, we don't have as many choices as windows users - but we here there is a clear choice with regard to personal finance software.  Go over to IGG and download a trial version of iBank and see for yourself.  Once you try iBank, you won't even give Quicken a second thought."
1,"It was (is) a generally well reviewed product in the the computer magazine/computer website world, which is why I bought this as a download from amazon about a year ago (i cite Maximum-PC's 2013 review especially).<br />I have had no trouble with it. It has functioned without causing my computer any grief. It is full featured and customizable but is also careful in its interface to make sure you do not configure things unsafely. I have seen it help me not get into trouble with malware at a number of time over the last 300+ days. I like how it communicates with me about things, without at the same time interfering with me when I am lost in a project or game.<br /><br />My real reason for reviewing at this point about one year later is to say Norton reminded me to renew. Normally I think of this a badgering and do not like it. And, well, for many years I used free antivirus, antispyware, antitracking, firewall software, a few of which are also well reviewed products and are very useful except for all of the  admirable customizable features this Norton product includes for the price of purchase.<br /><br />The renewal for a year, which I just purchase through the Norton website, cost me less than 22$. My original amazon price for the download was 27$. I did not find as low a renewal price here or elsewhere so I did purchase the renewal with Norton. By the way the Norton purchase process was good, allowing me to choose NOT to renew automatically and NOT to have my credit card information retained.<br /><br />Again, I am willing to pay a price, what I see as a reasonable price, to get what at this point I believe is worldclass protection for my humble pc universe. Take it with a grain of salt if you take it at all, understanding that I recommend this product as one that used Norton back in the 80s and 90s and ended up hating how intrusive it was, how huge was its footprint, and how hard it was to even delete from my pc when I did not want it there anymore. This norton product at this point in time is, well, quite humane.<br />Respectfully submitted,<br />D Nagyoduct at this point in time is, well, quite humane.<br />Respectfully submitted,<br />D Nagy"
1,"As in the past, I continue to trust Turbo Tax, and 2014 product was about as simple as it could be."
0,"I compared a dem version of this and chief architect product, and the chief architect home design program was better.  punch loads slowly, you have to turn off ALL scanning and firewall, including Microsoft defender.  chief architect loaded quickly, with no issues.  to compare the two programs, I  tried to build the same simple 2 story square house with a gable roof and a basement, with stairs, a landing and split level exit, with a kitchen in the corner.  in both programs, I had to reference the manual, but much less so with chief architect. I was also able to finish the structure much easier in chief architect.  I had problems adding a full basement, or additional floor, in punch.  Also, the kitchen cabinets were more difficult to place, and had the irritating habit of showing up half way through walls, or overlapping adjacent cabinets.  I had to carefully place them to butt up to, but not overlap, anything else.  The chief architect interface is designed much better, it is easier to navigate and figure out what you want by searching around. Not so much with punch.<br />punch is a bit cheaper, and with discounts I found online, I saved even more, so the punch product ended up being $134 vs $199 for the comparable chief architect product.  For me, the extra $65 is worth it for a product that is easier to use and is not frustrating.  Also, chief architect has an easy to find free demo to look at, Punch did not.<br /><br />  I am sure the punch software can do everything the chief architect software did, but it was much easier for me to figure out how to do it on the chief architect software.<br /><br />I purchased the punch product, as I was familiar with an old 1999 Broderbund product, which I really liked, and decided to return it after comparing the two over a week.  It has been a hassle so far, even though \I am following the procedures outlined on their return website.  Also, 4-6  weeks to process a return and mail me a cheque?  This is just a stalling tactic-they should be able to reverse the credit card charge within 3 days."
1,"Express Scribe is a great program. It is easily available for one-time use and it is also excellent for a full-time program. I use it for transcription and it works wonderfully! I have used the free version in the past, but recently I purchased the full version. It is so useful! Used with Fast Fox, a text expander or macro program put out by the same company, you can transcribe at lightning speed!<br />Express Scribe has an extensive help guide, but it is easy to use.I rarely need the guide, but when I do it is only a click away. No saving and looking for it later. The hyperlinks help you find exactly what information you need. The customer support is excellent as well. I had a glitch in my copy (which turned out to be easily fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling the program) and customer service answered within about 12 hours. For $39 software, that's great service."

0,Terrible!! Won't install (even though other antivirus programs will). Total waste of $15. Never buy these again!!
1,Updated often; it has kept my PC free of any obviously damaging malware so far. It does sometimes block something you want to open but worth the rare inconvenience to avoid problems.
0,"What a piece of sh*t software. I downloaded it and installed it and I can bring up the program but almost all the menu options are greyed out. If I click on the Help->About H&R Block menu option it says \\""Activation Code: (not entered)\\"" but doesn't offer me a way to enter it. Repeated cycles of uninstalling and reinstalling it doesn't seem to do the trick. If it is this problematic to install I can only imagine how crappy it will be to use. The only useful thing it does it when you click on \\""Exit\\"". Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
0,Bring back the taken aways features from the DELUXE version now! Or this shall be the end of TurboTax
0,"The product was good, but too difficult to use for my liking. Now here's the kicker: customer service with this company is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have been getting the run around from these people for over a month and nothing has been solved. I have tried 5 times now to return this product and every single time I get the same answer: send us an email with blah blah blah. Well, I've sent the email 5 times now and still...nothing. I absolutely URGE you to avoid using this company for you bookkeeping needs. There are so many great accountants out there and if you absolutely need to do your own books, there is other software you can use. The people at Intuit do NOT care about their customers and this is an absolute fact. I have had horrible experiences with not one, not two, not even three or four but FIVE customer service reps. Terrible. Please, take it from me and avoid doing business with this company for YOUR SANITY."
1,"Works Great, Free"
1,Great software to utilized
1,I got a new computer with Windows 8 and Windows 2010 but it didn't have Publisher with it so I bought it separate.  I use Publisher more than I use Word for just about everything.  I like how easy it is to use and would recommend it to anyone that has computer skills.
0,"My 2011 version stopped working in April of last year, and I manually entered transactions for a few months until the 2015 version was available.  After downloading and installing the software, some of my investment shares were off and wouldn't download.  I spent 2.5 hours with Quicken support chat, and what finally worked was downloading a new version from the Quicken website.  I think the issue was that the Amazon version converted my old database automatically, without first checking for Quicken software updates.  I've been using the software for several months now, and none of my bank or credit cards will download through the one step update.  I can download transactions by going to each bank or credit cards' site and downloading, but I miss the One Step Update feature.  I think the only site that automatically updates any more is Vanguard."
0,Bought the Mac version...downloads and installs fine but won't let you do your taxes because it needs an update and the updater for mac doesn't work at all.  I'm a computer guy...shouldn't be this hard...running OS X 10.10.1<br /><br />Saved some money with this program but...at least with turbo tax I could have done my taxes...this was a waste of money.
1,This was wonderful and I'll be thankful to have this the whole time I have my computer. Will renew without a doubt
1,"I have been using Quicken for over 15 years now and wouldn't change, I started out with just basic quicken and as my account needs changed Quicken had the software that fit the needs at each stage in my finical life."

0,"This is a review of Intuit in general as I made the mistake of getting their highly-marketed QuickBooks Online Plus, which is not available on Amazon, instead of this.<br /><br />While claiming connectivity between the 2 programs, this is not possible between QuickBooks Online (QBO) and TurboTax. After spending days meticulously getting my data inputted and organized in QBO's awful interface, I now need to import this data into TurboTax. Unfortunately I had to find out the hard way that this is not possible. I called customer service to see if there was anything they can do to help out, but help was the furthest thing I got. All I got was a &#34;tough s***&#34; attitude, and telling me that I made a mistake getting QuickBooks Online. I sure did..."

0,"Works reasonably well, but don't sign up for subscription, you CANNOT EVER, EVER CANCEL. I tried all the instruction on the web site (hint, there is no remove button), I canceled the credit card (they found another), I moved, they found me.  Now planning to sue them, not other option."
1,Awesome deal on great software!
1,It's free. Can't complain
0,"I switched to this version after upgrading of OSX10.8.5, which won't support the older version of quicken. In my previous review I indicated erroneously that it didn't support \\""reports\\"".  It turns out that it does support them. Also, when entering new transactions manually you have to select the \\""new\\"" icon and enter the info in a separate window. With the old version you could just go down the page and enter new transactions, which was more efficient.<br /><br />Importing transactions from your bank or credit card company is pretty straightforward, but it was with the old version, too.<br /><br />I wish OSX 10.8 supported my old and reliable Quicken '06."
1,Quickbooks on line is fairly easy to use. There are a few quirks you have to figure out but all in all it is easy to use.
1,"I started out using PFMS (personal financial management software) back in 2001 with Microsoft Money. They stopped supporting it in 2007 and two years later I switched over to Quicken. Been using it ever since, and every year it gets better. 2015 version is most complete yet, even includes free credit monitoring! Best aspect of the new software is how it easily allows you to track finances by category, spending habits, budget, just about any way you want to set it up. Reports are easy to find and read. It can calculate amortization schedules, & payoff dates--as well as allow you to estimate how certain changes in your budget effect your overall spending. It is flexible--allowing you to tailor your reports exactly to your liking (ex: sudden or unusual increased spending in a certain category) it also syncs up very nicely with your mobile device--so you can check your bank account or spending on-the-go, enter transactions, pay your bills, or confirm posted items from your personal bank account. Bottom line--if you need help organizing your finances, I can't think of a more useful and handy day-to-day tool that allows you to stay on top of where your money is going. Highly recommended!"
1,"I purchased Quicken Deluxe 2013 to upgrade Quicken Deluxe 2011 on a Windows PC. There was some hesitation to upgrade now due to poor early reviews on this software. But, as a long-time Quicken user (almost 20 years) and professional in the software development industry (25 years), I decided to accept the challenge. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Upgading:<br /><br />I actually upgraded twice - both times were flawless. Initially, after ensuring a good backup of my Quicken 2011 data, I simply downloaded Quicken 2013 and ran the installer. The software detected the presence of Q2011, made a backup copy of the data file, uninstalled the old version, installed the new, and then converted the data. No problems and the data converted fine.<br /><br />Due to some problems that were no fault of Intuit (e.g. I screwed something up), I had to re-install Quicken 2013 after restoring a system backup. This time, I made a copy of my data file, uninstalled Quicken 2011 myself and then installed Quicken 2013 from scratch. Again, no problems. I then pointed it to my Q2011 data file - and Quicken proceeded to convert it again - and again the conversion was flawless.<br /><br />First Impression:<br /><br />At first glance, Quicken Deluxe 2013 looks very much like Quicken Deluxe 2011. This is a good thing because I had no desire to completely relearn the GUI of the application. As you poke around though, you'll discover the subtle differences and feature enhancements. I'm pretty sure I haven't found all of those yet, but so far I like what I see. Manual and automatic data entry are almost identical to 2011, but there are some improvements in the Budget Tool.<br /><br />Mobile Applications and Support:<br /><br />Obviously, one of the biggest new features in this version is the introduction of the mobile apps. I've installed the Android app to my Motorola Droid and the iOS app to my iPad. I had no problems syncing the data and didn't experience any of the problems that some others have reported. Again, flawless operation. That being said, there's room for improvement on both versions of these apps. I'd like to see more of the desktop features added to the mobile apps - within the realistic capabilities of each. But, I'd consider this a good Version 1 of these applications, and will give Intuit the opportunity to \\""wow\\"" me with Version 2.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Another solid offering from Intuit and a worthwhile upgrade if you \\""need\\"" to upgrade for continued support, or if you want to dip your toes into the mobile applications. I'm not sure that new features alone would justify this upgrade otherwise - unless you like to always have the \\""latest and greatest\\"" like I do."
0,"I have used Quicken for years and been perfectly happy, only upgrading when absolutely necessary. This year I had to upgrade because my old version wasn't compatible with newer versions of Windows. NIGHTMARE!! I can't begin to count the things I hate about this compared to the 4 other versions I have used. Don't even bother. If you bought the software at a store, use it as a frisbee or a coaster, don't try to use it."

You won't be sorry."

0,"I have upgraded over the years and thought from the sales email, I thought that Quicken had followed the lead of other companies such as American Express, Bank of America were by opening the program on the cell, you could take a photo of your receipt and this would dock back into the computer program. I was disappointed that this is not or appears not to be the case, or if it is, the directions do not show that. It states that you can take a photo send it to your computer outside the program and then link into the program on the computer. Other companies have mastered this without the outside work"

1,"I could hire an expert, go to the tax prep people in Walmart, do it by hand, use HR Block, not do taxes at all(sure to be problematic),<br />or steal a copy of Turbo Tax.  I decided to go straight and buy the least expensive, lawful option for me that gives me some control over and understanding of my resources and income.  So of course I drifted over to Amazon and found Turbo Tax at a good price.<br />So, soon's I finish my work, I'm home free, hopefully, for another year.  I once got a message for underpayment after using Turbo Tax, but no big deal, I made the mistake and so I corrected it and gave Sam the bucks he wanted, and we shook hands and went our separate ways.<br />Now I would prefer to have a flat tax and to end all &#34;entitlements&#34;  and the various sorts of  govt controls on profits, rents etc and such of various sectors of the economy, reading Sowell's Basic Economics, which is an eye opener, but barring that--Oh yes, I favor a strong military and defense industry, and I WANT there to be regulatory agencies that are independent of politics and of being meddled with by the private sector and the freaking congress, and there to be single terms for house and senate and no revolving doors with Wall St, the Banks, Monsanto etc etc etc etc......<br />But I am on the subject of Turbo Tax.  Yep, it's worth buying and using and learning from.<br />That's my story and I'm stickin' with it!<br />Cheers!"

Have talked to 5 different Microsoft employee's and each has claimed it's not a problem they can address....but this is only after they put me on hold for 15 minutes.  My advice is to walk into a store and purchase the software in a box with a disk.  Would have cost me an extra $56, but might have saved me several hours on the phone."

For example, can't write checks or no financial planning, etc... all the features of the Windows and Mac 2007 version that are gone here.<br /><br />But I don't care about any of that.  I used Quicken just as a way to organize the multiple checking, credit-cards, etc.  In short I used it simply to download all the transaction statements from my various banks.<br /><br />And it's good at that... but here's why I give Quicken, Mint, and Intuit &#34;1&#34; star for this irresponsible product.<br /><br />Get this:  If you have a &#34;special character&#34; -- which means a non-alphabet or digit  -- &#34;Essentials&#34; will fail to link with that account.<br />Further, even if your main &#34;Intuit.com&#34; login has a special character, once again Essentials will not even be able to properly log in.<br /><br />And then to fix this they just say, &#34;reset your password to one that has no special characters&#34;.<br /><br />This is incredibly irresponsible in this time of advanced cyber hacking.  Intuit wants their customers to make weak passwords so that Essentials can work with those institutions, and even its own!<br /><br />Also, on those fails Essentials gives no indication about why it fails.  It was only through working with Customer Support that I discovered this limitation.<br /><br />This is straight from customer support:<br /><br />Dear Quicken Customer,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Quicken Customer Care and reporting this error to us.<br /><br />You might face this issue if you are using any special character in the password which you are using to update your bank accounts. If there is any special character, please change your password on bank's website and then try to add or refresh your accounts in Quicken Essentials."
0,"I really hate Turbo tax. It's so buggy and getting it to upload (and see) my last years taxes was a glitchy pain in the Butt. Technical support exist, but they make it extremely hard to reach. They make you &#34;ask the community&#34; which is hit and miss. End the end, To add the theimsult  they charged me an extra fee to efile. Maybe next year I'll find the time and learn how to do my taxes manually and drop this bad habit softwear once and for all."
1,Have used Avast for years.
1,"Very Good to use except, when I log into my register a new item I did not have in my payees memory list it doesn't register the transaction as a new item. WHY?"
0,"I feel like this program is improving my typing skills. I like the visuals and the music. I'm a doctoral student that does tons of online research. I want to get a bit faster at typing my papers out. The only problem is that I bought this as a download and have had trouble every few weeks since I got it. It stops opening and I have to uninstall the program and re-install the program several times. It is a waste of time that I don't really have. I guess it may have been better to buy on a CD??? Who knows, I just hope I don't continue to have this problem. This is the only download I purchased that I have had trouble with."
0,Thanks for nothing - Intuit customer since your days in Iowa and have used nothing but TurboTax since 1989 in all of it's various guises.  I'm moving to HR Block  as at least they understand that they're selling a glorified spreadsheet with a help function  . . . .
1,The downloaded version came in just fine.  Have been using it every day since.  No glitches or errors  to speak of.
1,The enhanced payroll system is perfect for small business.  You can file and pay Federal and state taxes in seconds.  Bam!  Done!  On to other things.

0,"Waste of Money.  H&R Block software does not work on a MAC.  The software kept penalizing me for an IRA<br />distribution.  I am 70.  There is no penalty.  At first they were helpful.  They swapped out the software and<br />I tried 2 different versions.  The other versions were even worse.  The first replacement software would not include<br />the Distribution.  The second replacement could not be updated to the current laws from the IRS.  Careful<br />of one thing they do which is really questionable.  If the software does not work, they will tell you that you have<br />a tax question and you need to pay for advice.  They shift you to another department and ask for money.  There was<br />one employee who was an expert in MAC.  He really did a great job.  He gave the exact steps to to swap out the<br />rotten code and gave the files to correct the software.  Unfortunately,  I had to go to the MAC apple store for<br />a technical review because the H&R block software would not close and thus could not be placed in the<br />trash.  Also, at the MAC store, the H&R icon could not be removed by traditional means.  The tech had to<br />seek an alternate route to purge the software.  They built this software for a child playing games.  It<br />also does not just show you your form in obvious sequence.  They put boxes at the top that you have to<br />eliminate.  The advice boxes are written by someone with no knowledge of taxes.  They also wrote the software<br />with the full intent to take over your computer like for every year taxes into the future.  They were more interested<br />in getting a permanent hook into your computer than they were in giving you the correct IRS numbers.<br />  I would say that if you file a 1040 only, this software maybe might work.  However, when I finally got my taxes<br />done by a professional, the correct numbers were not even close to what H&R Block said."
1,"I've used this tax software for the last 5 or 6 years. Easy to install, and does the job well.  No problems, no compaints."
0,"It works, i think.  Easy to install but not easy to turn off temporarily. The price was right."
0,"Terrible product. It freezes your computer while it runs. Even after install, you get pop-ups to register their product.  100% virus!!  This is funny!! If you go to avast to ask how to remove their own Antivirus, they ask you to install a new software that will erase the old one... https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility"
0,"I downloaded the software, it worked fine, the State wasn't yet available.  H&R didn't send an access code, I notified them, they said they didn't yet have the info from Amazon.  I got the State download, entered all my data, no access code yet.  Then the software deleted all of my data in the file, the file is still there but no name, address, SSN, etc, all data is now zero.  After waiting on the phone for half an hour, I got an access code, entered it, but all data is still blank."
0,"Not even close to Turbotax! Poor interface, hard to follow, lacking forms, etc. Used Turbotax for over 10 years so I figured I give something else a try. Wasted $20, now I have to get Turbotax to complete my filing. Don't be cheap like I tried and spend a few more dollars to get much better software!"
1,Everything transferred with a click of a button!
0,"We wasted $60 on this software, hoping that it would be a replacement for Quicken 2007.<br /><br />While iBank can do the bare-bones basics well (like balancing a checkbook), it has literally HUNDREDS of bugs in the product... and it can't even do BASIC REPORTING like Quicken could. Here we are, at the end of the year at tax time, and we can't even get the reports that we need out of iBank to get our tax data to the IRS.<br /><br />If you like your data being held hostage, then this is the app for you.<br /><br />If you don't believe our complaints, check out the IGG Software Forums on their websites for THOUSANDS of complaints from other iBank users, that have gone UNANSWERED by iBank's technical support team.<br /><br />iBank's technical support is incompetent & clueless at best, and completely unresponsive for weeks on end at worst.<br /><br />iBank will NEVER be the product that people want it to be.<br /><br />Our best advice would be to wait until Quicken 2007 is updated for Lion in a few months, and use that instead."

1,"Corel is always a great Value. I have been using Corel products since the early 90's and have always been more that pleased. I don't know how Corel gives you so much product for such a reasonable price, but they keep doing it. Not only is this product great, but I would recommend all their products if you want value without any fear of buying a product over the internet. Some of the programs you buy on the internet have built in viruses that are annoying and/or add start up programs that slow down your computer. Corel only sells quality programs that do what they say they do. I would give more than 5 stars if I could."

0,"This software is incredibly difficult to understand. The Little Square offers help but it hasn't actually helped solved any of my problems. We own a small drive thru deli and need to be able to input our sales and sales tax, but it won't seem to let us do that. It also says that we can link our banking or download our transactions, but it won't actually let me do that either. My bank is not supported so I have to manually enter every transaction. I could have created an excel spreadsheet to do that for free. Not sure yet what the benefit of paying $200 for this item is."

0,the arhitectural options for components like doors or windows are in this version almost non existent. Also the drwawing tool takes a lot of work. It is not life like drewing. I purchased it as it was sted to be CADCam but cumbersome to use. I like to return it.
1,"For those complaining of issue with installing.  When you first download, you're given a &#34;Product Code&#34;; however, my installer was asking for a &#34;Serial Number&#34;.  I tried to use the Product Code, but that didn't work.  All you have to is contact support at https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/software-downloads.html? Go to this site and enter your information.  You'll get a call-back immediately from a real human being.  As it turns out, I was supposed to receive another email that told me how to &#34;verify&#34; I was a student or teacher.  I never received the email, so the support person simply forwarded me the email.  I clicked the link in the email, walked through the process, and ba-da-boom.  Easy peasy."
1,easiest way to do taxes
1,Great program! Very easy to use and it really does a great job actively seeking virus and bad registry keys.
1,"I've been using Avast Free antivirus for years. I'm on my computer 6 to 8 hours a day, mainly surfing, and I have NEVER had a problem with anything infecting my computer. Avast also has some VERY reasonably priced upgrades for those who need additional coverage."
1,This is the best antivirus that I have ever used. It keeps all of my computers and workstations clean from all viruses!
0,"I have used Macs exclusively since 2008 after using PCs since 1990.  I started using Quickbooks Mac in the 2012 version.  Aside from the normal functions of just tracking transactions it is almost completely worthless for me as a business tool.  Without support for the accountant's copy it is of no use.  I have used the roundtrip feature.  In theory this would work just fine.  Depending on how long it takes the accountant to get the file back you are dead in the water during this process.  If it takes a couple of months, like tax season, it is unbearable.<br /><br />Businesses use the same banks, have the same customers, pay taxes to the same IRS.  Why would a business software company even begin to think that their product should not be the same regardless of the platform?<br /><br />I use a VM and run Quickbooks on the Windows VM.  It works, but it is still a pain.  There really is not another solution for Mac users since almost all accountants use the enterprise version of Quickbooks.<br /><br />Please listen Intuit.  A lot of other software companies make great software that is cross platform.  Adobe, Avid, etc.  I really am sorry for the rant but this is really unacceptable.  BTW I have purchased your products since the DOS days of Quicken."
1,Seems to work ok.
1,"My 4th grader loves this software.  She is working hard to learn traditional typing, in a fun and playful way!"
0,I bought this for $27.99 and less than 36 hours it went to $23.75! Amazon will not price match their own prices. At least retail stores give us 30 days!!! Not cool at all Amazon!
1,"Does everything I used to do in Photoshop for quite a bit less cost. For graphic work, this is all I need."
1,"Prior to using QuickBooks, reconciliation of checking accounts and preparation of payroll took several hours of time and required a full-time clerk to handle these matters.  Now those tasks take a matter of minutes."
1,"Great product for my small business. Large enough to grow into as the future changes, but adapts perfectly to what I need."
1,Worked perfectly for my needs. It was so much easier than the past years of filling out all the forms by hand and reading the 20-page instruction booklets.

1,"Since we had a very complicated life style over the past 20+ years; we have always used a tax professional to do our taxes.  The \\""complications\\"" have now dissipated; so we decided to try doing our own tax return using Turbo Tax.  We initially got the free version to check it out and found it so easy to use.  We purchased the Deluxe version; and let me tell you, it is a fabulous program!  The software walks you through the entire process; and checks to make sure you are not missing out on a deduction or credit - works to get you the best refund possible.  What more can you ask for?"

0,"For the basics of managing checking and saving accounts, Quicken 2013 meets my needs. The mobile app works reasonably well with Bank of America. I am able to log my expenditures and categorize them on the go, which is a big convenience, as this saves time when it comes time to log into the desktop program. There are some annoyances however. One is inconsistent balances. For example, in the Quicken desktop program, I may enter expected income or expenditures such as bills or paychecks. When I look in the mobile app, the addition of these future expenditures is inconsistent. Some may appear and others may not. This results in the Ending Balance being off. This does seem to be a Quicken problem that needs to be addressed.<br /><br />Another issue is the use of the Cloud. I am not a fan of sending financial data across the Cloud. I would prefer the ability to sync using a direct connect or transfer between my mobile app and my computer.<br /><br />Due to transactions processing at my bank, the true available balance is not displayed in the mobile app. For example, I may have a transaction for a purchase appear on my bank's website as \\""Processing\\"" rather than \\""Posted.\\"" Quicken mobile will track the account balance of all Posted transactions, but doesn't include the \\""Processing\\"" transactions. I realize that Processing transactions may change, but I don't get a true sense of what is actually available to me to spend. I don't know if that is a problem that Quicken can solve or not since it seems to have more to do with how the bank operates.<br /><br />Overall, this is a step in the right direction. It isn't perfect and I waffled between giving the product 3 or 4 stars. I went with 3 because it appears to be heading in the right direction, but needs some work."
1,"I've worked with Quicken and Quickbooks (honestly) since version 1.0 on both Mac and PC. I was so over it. When the new Mac version came out, my daughter convinced me to upgrade. Ok. You win. This is by far the easiest, most intuitive version I've seen. I'm back.  What I like most is the iPad interface. Makes life even easier. The other day I had a disagreement with a vendor. Rather than booting up my computer, the answer was immediately available on the iPad. ... And I was right!"
0,No good for Apple Macs as it only works on window devices. They need to do one for the Apple machines.
1,Great product would recommend to everyone and will order every year.  extremely very easy to load and use and submit
0,I had last used Quicken 10years ago. I recently purchased the online version. The first thing it wanted was my online banking. I don't have that. It is a very difficult program to use. Not like the old quicken. I started my business witha personal loan. I have been unable to simply input my purchases etc. How do I return this item and get an older version?
0,when it said it was completly instaled and finished it did not say it was even downloaded and would not work.
1,"Guess this could be 5 stars.  Downloaded wireless in 8 minutes.  Installed on new 27&#34; iMac running Mavs but upon opening office apps, would not work.  Had to install updates also that are free from microsoft website, there were 3 updates that HAD to be installed.  Once done, all apps work ok.  Had to do some research to figure this out though.  I can only presume this is reason why apps would not open, like Excel and Word."

0,"&#34;Phone home&#34; software which constantly wants to be validated online.  Regret having paid for the 2015 upgrade; previous versions weren't quite so obtrusive.  Will not give Chief any additional business on this point alone.  Otherwise, this edition (&#34;Pro&#34;) is adequate, but overly expensive for the feature set.  Roofing is particularly tricky, and electrical is woefully inadequate.  Stability has improved over previous versions, but crashing is still an issue.  Dimensioning has also improved, but it's still painfully difficult to measure and add interior dimensions in many cases."
0,"It constantly needs to be updated.  Let's loosely define &#34;constant&#34; as weekly.  Half the time I am pretty sure it forces me to update just to give another chance to try and sell me some things or try to install its browser of choice.  It's free, sort of.  Though I'm not convinced it's worth the hassle."
1,"This has been a great experience in transitioning from TurboTax.  Once TurboTax decided to gouge it's customers, I decided to give H&R Block a try.  I am VERY pleased and it was $10 less to boot.  I'm never going back to TurboTax."
1,"Indispensable for anyone planning a trip.  I fell in love with Streets and Trips when it first came out and it, like a good vintage wine, has done nothing but get better."
0,Stopping the support of Quicken 2010 so that you can no longer download in essence makes you switch to a more recent version or to another company.  I upgraded to 2013 and had to spend an hour with a tech that would find the bug that was not allowing me to download from by bank.<br /><br />  I used Intuits payroll for my business and I can no longer download payroll information to my Quicken 2013.  Why did I stay with Intuit????
1,I ran out of my subscription to my anti virus and I didn't want to pay a arm and a leg<br />for virus protection so I shopped on Amazon and found the same item for over $20 less.<br />That was fantastic.  Works great using on three computers.  Couldn't ask for a better<br />deal.
1,Turbotax makes my sticker peck out just knowing I am not paying one of the big tax preparer chain stores hundreds of dollars to do the same thing.
1,Quick delivery and excellent service. Thanks.
1,"Working Flawlessly.<br /><br />I have been a Quicken user since 2005, migrating from MS Money.  I upgrade annually.  2014 (with patch update) is the best product to date.  The cloud sync with my Android is great...worth the price of the update alone!  I take photos of receipts, assign categories, and bingo, automatically transported to my computer (once synced).  This helps tremendously with budgeting...as small common purchases/receipts can slip out of my pocket (like change).<br /><br />I noticed a lot of bad reviews.  I don't know why.  Either they haven't installed the patch or...haven't figured out what they are doing.  It's a great piece of software, thus far working flawlessly.  I'm glad I've updated!"
1,"You can't do your own taxes by hand anymore unless your situation is very very simple.  I used Turbo Tax many many years ago, and it was just as easy to use as H&R Block's software.  But every year, this title is always a few dollars cheaper.  I don't need all of the extra bells and whistles in the Delux or other versions, since all of the versions have the same forms.  I buy this every year, and every year, I am satisfied."

1,"Reading some of these reviews almost made me not buy this.<br /><br />One caveat: You can not use this software for commercial purposes, but that is OK with me.<br /><br />I just finished building a high performance WIN 7 PC and needed a word processor and a spreadsheet program and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for the programs. Since I have digitally downloaded a few games from Amazon before I decided, what the heck, I will give it a shot. Not one problem. Everything went smoothly. I have a pretty good Comcast Internet connection so the download was quite fast. This was all good since I am experimenting with the use of a new 256GB 6g SSD as my operating system - boot drive. When they say the SSD beats out a traditional hard drive they certainly are kidding. Question is: how long will the fast SSD work.<br /><br />I have been fooling around with changing hardware and software on all types of PCs since the middle 90's. I can understand how there are conditions where trying to download and install this type of offer can have problems. However, due to the funny nature of Windows PCs I personally would not just make a blanket statement that no one should do this. Also, I did have the actual program software download on to my PC. I would, apparently, just use the Amazon installer if I needed to reinstall it over again. I am from the \\""old school\\"" of working with PCs and I probably will never get used to the new digital distribution and so-called \\""Cloud\\"" (fancy name for a server if I ever heard one) business models, but they seem to be an improvement over the \\""old\\"" ways for sure.<br /><br />Also, don't lose the program key."

0,not exactly as easy to use as i thought it would be
1,"I've been using Norton for a long time.  It's very easy to install and run.  Amazon definately has the very best price, better than the electronics stores, and way better than renewing from Symantec themselves...they want more than double the price of Amazon.  The download is very fast and the install takes just minutes.  Would definately buy this product again from here."
0,"I read the other reviews about how easy this was to learn and that it had all they needed. Honestly, I can do most of its functions that I CAN figure out how to do on other programs like PowerPoint and Publisher a lot easier. Not what I expected at all."
0,"I have used AVG for many years with total satisfaction, however, since installing this software my computer runs at a snail's pace and locks up during the middle of an activity.  Now, I am getting an error message that I do not have complete internet protection -- ONLY WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE FREE EDITION!!!"
0,"I only use my Quicken for my personal checkbook and year end summaries.  I completely resent that it locks me out after a year or so, and forces to me to buy a new update if I want to download from my bank.  If there is any other system I could use, please let me know."
1,"I am on a fixed income with not much spare cash to spend. I have relied on Avast to prevent viral invasions to my computer, which is my lifeline to the outside world. I am immensely grateful for the service you provide. Thank you."
1,Recommend to all.  A lot of tools to use even with the free edition.  Does enough for me using just the free edition.
1,Works great easy to download I am a returning customer for the past  three (3) years great software great deal
0,This doesn't load on a Mac with Yosemite without complicated rewrites of the installation program.  Should come with a warning.
0,"There are \\""changes\\"" which I am still trying to adapt to. In fairness, it may be that I chose the Deluxe version over my previous Premier (2013) version."
1,"There were a few years where I couldn't work with Norton products on my drive. They interfered with everything.  Well, Symantec finally has things right!  The product works well and nice and quiet too! The automatic scans work great during idle time and if you want your system to work on a long project (say a video render), you just easily click \\""Silent Mode\\"" and Norton won't perform any automatic scans or updates during the timeframe you set from an hour to an entire day. With one click in Norton, I shut off the internet and with another I turn on silent mode before rendering my videos.  Excellent."
1,Used Microsoft Money for years and was very hesitant to change.  Love this program.  Use it for my personal finances and to track income and expenses for my independant home sales business.
1,Meet all my expectation.. I've been using Norton for the past two years and it has been able to keep my laptop away from virus without slowing it. I would highly recommend it to people looking for internet security software.
1,"Norton Antivirus 2010 has removed hundreds of viruses from my computer, which is a good thing, but the optimization isn't so effective; plus, during the full system scan, my computer (vista) is slowed down a bit (program and internet).    I would recommend it of those whose computer is infected by hundreds of viruses, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're using a vista and/or your computer is a few years old because then your computer program's download will be slowed."
1,"I use it every year, and switched from turbo tax yeas ago when it got too expensive.  Easily walks you through the process."
0,I have used tax cut for serveral years with good success.  Now it is putting your deducton pro online and I cannot get the file.  Might be solvable but there is absolutely no support or forum online.  Check their site for the offered support before you buy.  I will move to turbo tax.  This used to be a workable program.  I cannot imagine how they could drop online support.
1,Awesome Product.
0,"Real hard to load. Would not apply the updates. Removed the program and reloaded it several times. This should have been simple. Quicken had me over a barrel. Loved Quicken Home and Business 2010, but as of April 2013 it would no longer download stock quotes and account data. Had to buy the 2013 version and was disappointed."
0,"Never again will I buy a Bitdefender product.<br /><br />I have had it nearly a year now.  I would say it's ok at protecting from malware and viruses.  I went to Bitdefender from Kaspersky and I get a lot less false positives and slowdown from Bitdefender.  Kaspersky was very effective, but crippled my computer with its constant false positives and slowdowns.  Bitdefender also does this but at a far slower rate.<br /><br />My problem is with the popup ads I keep getting for Bitdefender products.  They cannot be turned off.  They happen more and more often as I get closer to the end of my year.  The irony that an antivirus program would do this is apparently lost on the creators."
1,Great value and easy to use.
1,"Although it didn't mention it in te description, this is good for Windows 8.  Since I also bought it within a certain time frame, I received a free upgrade as soon as the next version came out, which it did within 2 weeks. Both were super easy to install and use."
0,"After using Tax Cut for several years I switched back to Turbo tax this year.  I wish I hadn't because it did a horrible job with my state taxes.  The interface for the state form is very easy to navigate and it does the state taxes in a jiff but all that ease if very miss leading.  The interface has absolutely no place to include a 529 college saving plan.  In the end I had to go to state.gov to find out which form to enter the credit on.  If I had not done this and left the program to its own devices, I would have ended up owing instead of getting a refund (a difference of over several hundred dollars).  I'll go back to tax cut next year and and pocket the savings."
0,"I really like Norton 360 Premier Multi Device - Now they went and fixed what was not broken - Might want to ask MS how well that worked for them (MS 8) - 360 was a complete package and did a great job keeping my computer, tablet, and phone safe - Norton Security does not replace it, rather, it forces one to buy 2 or 3 items to obtain the same level of protection and appears to be all bottom line driven - Further, it is far more labor and time intensive for the user - Shame on Norton - I am a retired software engineer and have been a Norton customer since the beginning - guess it is time to move on...."
1,I use it almost every day in my practice.
1,It was good to review what I was taught in school many years ago.
0,"I renew my objection to Amazon's five-star rating system - it forces you to hand out at least one star, and some times, like with Quicken 2014, that is one star too many.<br /><br />We've used Quicken since 1996, and we have purchased numerous upgrades over the years. Here is how Quicken 2014 differs from the other versions:<br />- it cost me more to buy than older versions<br />- it didn't work correctly when it was first used<br />- it began to crash whenever it was used<br />- it finally ate my Quicken database, which had my financials since 1996 in it<br />- it also ate all the tax-related information I normally export from Quicken to TurboTax.<br /><br />So my current status:<br />- defrauded (they took my money and have not provided a product that works)<br />- frustrated (hours and hours spent trying to fix issues)<br />- poorer (I have no idea how to recover some of the very specific tax info lost when it ate my files)<br /><br />Run, don't walk, away from Quicken 2014 (including the R5 update version). This iteration is so bad that it should result in a real competitor emerging in the market and Intuit losing the market stranglehold. We can only hope..."
1,I have used H&R Block software for several years now and find it easier to imput data and import prior year information when compared to the software I previously used (TurboTax).
0,The program would pop a window up every time your cursor went over a box that gave instructions on hoe to use it. After having the program for 2 hours it froze up on my computer. It was very frustrating so I uninstalled. Looking for a different program. I was not impressed.
0,"I had so many problems with it, that I will not buy it again next year.  So much problems that it wouldn't let me and my son use it.  We both had the same name, however, I was Sr. and my son was Jr.  yet, it would not let me use it.  That is a total  no no for me. Further, the information we had last year it would not download it either.  I had to write everything all over again.  This years Turbo Tax was a total mistake in me buying it.  I should have asked for my money back period.  All I know is that Intuit lost a repeat customer for next year.  If they had problem with the software, they should have corrected the problems before putting TurboTax out in the market for people to buy.  A former customer.  Inntuit needs to get their act together."
1,good

0,"I have used Mac TurboTax (and its predecessor MacInTax) for over 20 years. Finally, I have been forced to abandon TurboTax completely on account of Intuit's evolving design philosophy to wrest ultimate control of your tax return away from you and force it to look the way they want it to look.<br /><br />Specifically, my complaint is that TurboTax is increasingly limiting the user's ability to OVERRIDE values on the return. In the past -- for many, many years -- a user could override any calculated or transferred value anywhere on the return. But beginning in 2011 and continuing to the present, that ability has become increasingly restricted. As a practical meter, this means that you can't necessarily make your tax return look the way YOU want it to look. Now, Intuit essentially tells you how it HAS to look (if you use their software).<br /><br />At first, limitations on overrides only appeared on Form 8582 (Passive Activities) AND its worksheets. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 I had to prepare Form 8582 and its worksheets with a TYPEWRITER (!!!). But then in 2013, it got even worse when the &#34;no overrides&#34; principle was extended to Form 4562 (Depreciation). My federal return makes extensive use of both Form 8582 and Form 4562. These are critical forms and without the ability to complete them the way I want to complete them, I simply can't and won't use the TurboTax program. So I'm done with it.<br /><br />What to do now? In 2013, as an experiment, I purchased and used both TurboTax and H&R Block's Tax Software to prepare my return. Interestingly, the paper return I ended up filing (I always file paper returns) was a mixture of pages from the two programs. The difference between the two programs was huge. H&R Block is what TurboTax used to be: It is intuitive, easy to use, and every entry on every form is totally within control of the user. You can prepare your return to look EXACTLY like you want want it to look -- H&R Block is not looking over your shoulder, so tospeak, while you do it. It's also much cheaper, at $35 for the &#34;Deluxe&#34; Federal and State version.<br /><br />I will admit that TurboTax is slicker, has a fancier interface, and might cover some unusual tax situations that H&R Block doesn't. (But not in my return, which is pretty complicated as these things go.) But I don't need &#34;slick.&#34; I need something that will prepare my return the way I want it prepared.... exactly as I want it prepared. If you are an experienced DIY tax return preparer with even a moderately complicated return, you should want the same thing. I would highly recommend anyone to investigate the H&R Block product. For me, it's perfect."
1,Works great.
1,"Ordered this after checking the reviews for TurboTax (like many of the reviews here).  The install was a snap.  I was able to import last year's TurboTax file with no problem.  I checked the information and it did import correctly.  I also checked and all the necessary forms are there that TurboTax decided to omit.  I've already recommended this to several people.<br /><br />Note: I purchased this a week before H&R Block offered the free product.  In the interest of full disclosure, I've used TurboTax for the past 5 years and this was my first H&R Block purchase."
0,"I was disappointed in the sample floor plans [very basic] and it took 8 hours of frustration downloading even with DSL, but when I looked at it again later, and calmer, it's not the waste I thought it was. It's very much like a home design program I had about 10 years ago, so don't expect too much from it."
0,"Boy, am I glad I decided to read the TT Deluxe reviews for this year! I too have been a long time satisfied customer (about 14 years) but having seen the product downgrades, I'll also be saying, GOODBYE!<br /><br />Thanks to all of the helpful Amazon users out there who just saved me money!!"
1,It is fast and updates itself frequently.  I've used it for a few years and I have never had a virus get through.  I would recommend it to every one.
0,I have been trying to install and upgrade from Quicken 2013 Deluxe...What a nightmare. I have been on chat for 2 hours. now again with chat. It all started with the program wanted me to create an online login. Then went down hill. How do I get my money back? Can someone help me? I have used this software for years. I loved it. now it's so bad. I can't even install it.
1,"Instant download worked, perfectly -even got the first two weeks free! User friendly and I feel.my coputer is safe!! Thanks!"
1,It worked great with no issues at all.
1,"So far very pleased.  This was an upgrade from Quicken 2009 and it seems to have a few more useful capabilties.  Still working through all of the features, but I will post updates at a future date."
0,I have never liked Illustrator much. Always thought FreeHand was way better. I don't think it is realistic to revive FreeHand due to how long ago it has been killed off.<br /><br />Bohemian Coding's Sketch looks really interesting and is not bloated. I will be keeping a really close eye on that app. Also iDraw looks very promising (for the Mac) and comes with a companion iPad app. Adobe currently does have a vector drawing on a tablet which will be a market that is increasingly important over the next couple of years. I am not knowledgable about the Windows/Android options but I am sure someone else can cover those alternatives in their review. It does not make sense for Adobe to be charging this much for software this bad.
0,"I chose to rate QuickBooks, because the entire download and installation was not easy.  The instructions leave a couple of steps complete out or they are incorrect.  I had to phone for help twice during the install.  The phone assist was also very difficult as I could not understand the English that was spoken.  I use QuickBooks because this is an inherited practice from the company I currently work for, but it would not have been my first choice."
0,"I purchased the software from a local store. I followed the directions on the package spending hours  downloading and setting up the office. But the software never works as advertised. Big mistake buy it. I wonder why they want to make people's lives more difficult. Unless you have plenty of time to spend on getting this  office 365 to work, stick to the 2000 - 2013 version."
1,Avast! seems to work quite well. If I had the money to invest in paid virus protection this is the one I'd buy.
0,"Having to create a microsoft account and register this product to install it is unacceptable.  If you are an IT person, or own a small business and want to install this multiple times, GOOD LUCK.  You will have to register a separate account for each install, and after 3 or 4, Microsoft will tell you that you have reached your limit for new MS accounts for that day and have to wait.  If you are a business owner, maybe you don't want each copy registered to a different MS account?  MS doesn't care.  It's in the title - Office Home and BUSINESS!  This is a terrible implementation for BUSINESS.  And to get the true business installer without all this front end crap, you have to go through their Open Licensing Program, and each copy costs almost twice as much.  Then once you start using this version, you soon realize that it's all the same stuff as before, they just moved everything around and changed the way it looks."
1,"I've used TurboTax for years. I've heard people say it doesn't cover all aspects of deductions. I say BS (to put is simply).  For those with simple tax returns, Turbo is more than most will ever need.  Yet, if you have many expenses/deductions across the board, Turbo will cover them all.<br /><br />I'm in Law Enforcement, own a property, give to charity, home energy improvements, etc. Turbo covers ALL areas of deductions and tax preparation.  TT covers all my standard deductions; mortgage interest, property taxes, work expenses (equipment costs, labor dues, education expenses), energy efficient upgrades to the house, charitable donations, tax software, medical, you name it.<br /><br />My father spent years doing taxes by hand. He finally used Turbo Tax to file his returns related to not just my folks, but the combining of trusts of his parents into his own. It all was covered in Turbo Tax<br /><br />If you make charitable donations during the year, considering using ItsDeductible online (another Intuit software).  The benefit is goods are valued based on national averages.  Those jeans you gave to good will for free, have a fair market value of $10.  I'm continually amazed at what people donate to charities like Goodwill, who never deduct the goods, which is perfectly legal to do.  ItsDeductible lists 1000s of items for donation and assigned a value.  Few realize, you are allowed to deduct the &#34;fair market value&#34; of goods you donate. So, if Goodwill sells jeans for $10, that is what you deduct.  ItsDeductible has made my donations easy, good value and when you use TurboTax, it will import your donations from I.D. into your tax return."
0,I've read some complaints about people who downloaded the software from Amazon and did not get the KEYCODE that allows them to e-file for free. I was similarly perplexed until I saw on the Amazon product page the link that says: 'Looking for your e-file key? Find it in Your Games & Software Library'. If you've purchased and downloaded the software from Amazon you'll find your keycode in 'Your Games & Software Library' Just follow the link and look for the Product Key.
0,One of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon.  It not only will not end your pop ups and malware but now most of what I am getting is coming from this software.  Total waste of money DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Love it.  Very easy to understand and use. I have used for the last 15 years.  I like the immediate refund  or (pay) feature
1,Love it and easy to get it right away than have to drive to Fry's Electrics Store and find for 10 Devices. Save time and Money on Gas and Mileage.
0,Extremely dissapointed in your decision to remove Schedules C and D from the software.  I already bought and installed the Deluxe software without realizing it did not have the same functionality I had come to expect in the past.  I might be able to understand removing schedule C but I would certainly think that many of your customers would have capital gains and need Schedule D.  Since I need both of those schedules I'm not sure if I will buy your upgraded product or buy something else and start anew with that software.
0,"After waiting 2 weeks to get the serial number. Just found out that they were sent but never received them.<br />Call customer support, 18 minutes or longer on chat and between 58 minutes and 1:10 minutes on the phone????? WTH!<br />Geewhiz, I can't use the product I bought because your system sputtered and you are too cheap to add customer service people.<br /><br />Adobe... you stink!<br /><br />I will try Gimp as it is free and if I like it, I will tell Adobe that they can keep their software"
1,Great antivirus- Best I have ever used
0,what ever you do don't misspell a word because the spell checker sucks it doesn't work to save your life besides that it is a great word processor for the money
1,The product did everything it was designed to do.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs protection from internet hackers
1,"I've used H&R Block for several years now, don't even remember how long, the first time was on a Windows 95 computer.  My experience with the program comes down to two things:  First (and most important) is that I've never had an issue with the IRS.  my tax returns with H&R Block have always been good, No Problems.  Second (and also important) the program get better every year.  I thought last year (2011) was good, but this years was even better, the interface in easy, the questions are understandable, you can skip over areas that do no apply, or you can dig deep into any particular area.  All in all, a good program which I will again use for my 2013 taxes."
0,I had a trust  and the trust had a partnership.  The turbo tax did not give me the options I needed to use.  Also I have an annuity and turbo tax kept asking me on and on and on a dozen times did I have the correct numbers down.  I am going to have to take my taxes to a CPA.  The turbo tax did not have what I needed.  The K-1 it generated did not fulfill my special needs.
1,I first got Avast dowloaded because of its price....free. I have now used it for years on all of my home pc's and have always had great protection. I have even gotten other family members and friends on the Avast band wagon because of the reliability of its protection and ease of use.
1,Had it for about 3 years now for 4 different computers with no problems at all.
0,"As a fan of Amazon, I am disappointed to say that both Amazon's overall Cloud Drive implementation and their application are poor examples of what a cloud-based storage implementation should be.  If this is your first experience, do not judge the cloud based on Amazon.  Look at Google, Dropbox or many of the other well thought out solutions out there.<br /><br />I will not try and list all of the things wrong with their service, but I will highlight the top reasons to stay away unless you are looking to simply store music and photos for your Kindle.<br /><br />1.  Performance is terrible.  On my 35 Mbps connection, I can download a file from my Amazon drive and my Dropbox drive at the same time.  Dropbox is 2-3 times faster on downloads.  It is easily 10 times faster to upload to Dropbox than it is to Amazon.<br />2.  No syncing.  Shocking to say they don't have this considering EVERY ONE of their main competitors does and it is considered one of the most basic cloud features.  Worse is that they did and then replaced their desktop app with a poor excuse for a web front end that runs on your system and solely functions to let you select your cloud drive folder location and open their cloud website to manage your files.  Once you put something in there, don't expect it to be backed up.  You want something on the cloud, you must manually upload it, file by file.<br />3.  Cannot delete folders.  How basic a feature is this?  Well, Amazon does not seem to support it.  Want to delete a directory?  You must navigate down through all the folders, one by one, in the web app and manually delete each file.  If there is a way to do it by folder, it is hidden well.<br />4.  All management is web based.  Want to move things around in Explorer like you can with everyone else?  Not here.  You have to use their web app to manage your files.  Great for a Kindle, not so much for a PC.<br /><br />Honestly, other than automatically finding my music that I purchased from Amazon in my drive and getting unlimited photo storage space, I cannot think of anything redeeming about Amazon's implementation.  They are asleep at the wheel in this case.<br /><br />Update:  Amazon did refund my money and reduced me back to the Free 5GB account.  While that is not a product-specific thing, it is one of the reasons I have always been a avid Amazon customer.  They also let me know that you can select folders for deletion by holding the Shift key down when you click them.  This is not enough for me to adjust my rating as it is still missing to many basic features but at least it clears up one of the \\""what were they thinking\\"" items.  It also talks to the lack of usability - there are many better ways they could have done this without leaving it to you to figure out.  :)age space, I cannot think of anything redeeming about Amazon's implementation.

Movavi forces you to re-activate the product every time they make a change forcing you to download a new version.  Being forced to download the new version would not be so bad if their activation wizard wasn't as buggy as a rainy night in Georgia.  I re- activated 2 nights ago and it went fine, today I have to re-activate again and it failed. I go through this process ALL THE TIME!<br /><br />Good product - ridiculous situation.  If you have endless hours to waste on talking to their help desk and dealing with the absurd doesn't  frustrate you, then this product is for you -  it actually works when you can get past all the activation screens.to use it."
1,I have used Turbo Tax for many years and have never been disappointed.  It has always made preparing my taxes so much easier.  I purchased this from Amazon this year because it was the least expensive option this year.  Every other retail outlet I found had it for $10.00 more.
0,"I initially had a problem because the application does not seem to fully support the latest PSD files and crashes when trying to open them or preview them. I do like that most of the EDIT interface is similar to my old PSP8 that I love so much but has additional new features and runs better on Windows 7.   If you have issues with the application crashing, look to see if the initial preview directory has PSD files present and move them. I hope they fix this issue. If they fix it then I will upgrade this review to 5 stars."
0,"The only reason I bought this was because I was getting messages that my Quicken 2009 services, downloads, etc wasnt going to be supported anymore so they werent going to work.  Sure enough, after the cutoff date, I couldn't download transactions directly from my financial institutions anymore.  I kind of feel like they were holding me hostage, forcing me to pay another $35 or so to keep the convenience of being able to download.  Its kind of a crappy thing to do.  They shouldn't disable features and services that work perfectly fine on software.  The fact of the matter is that Quicken 2012 offers NOTHING for me and the way I use the software that my Quicken 2009 didn't do.  I wouldn't have upgraded otherwise, I wouldn't have needed to.  But here I was, held hostage and I figure in 3 years they'll probably pull the same stunt again.  If they do, I might start to look at what other options are out there because money management software has come a long way since Quicken was the innovator in personal finance software.<br /><br />So I get this thing installed and that was fine but guess what?  None of the financial institution downloads would work.  So the very thing that I bought it for was the very thing that wasn't working.  I contacted customer support, and the guy couldn't figure it out so he had me email logs and such and said someone would get back to me in 7 - 10 business days.  After 3 weeks I still hadn't heard anything so I emailed back twice more.  Finally I got a solution to the problem (turns out it was a very quick and simple fix that the first guy should have been able to address).  So I'm glad they solved my problem but the hoops I jumped through with their service made me a little unhappy.  Still, its always been generally reliable software that usually works as it should, so as long as nothing else breaks on it, I guess I'll be a happy camper.<br /><br />Anyway, this may be a great thing for you or you might find alternatives that are just as good or better.  I think it really depends on how you use the software and what your needs are and what you're trying to accomplish.  That will give you an idea of what features are going to be important to you, how robust you need the software to be and ultimately, whether this product, a different Quicken product or a product from a competing company will make the most sense for you.better.

1,Bought it on o good discount. No issues installing. Nice adobe program as advertised. Retina support is very nice to have
0,One of the strengths of this product for former TurboTax users is that one can import previous year's returns from TurboTax - - UNLESS YOU STILL USE WINDOWS XP!  This needs to be stated up-front in an easy to find location.

1,"I have used WordPerfect for 30+ years. Back in the days the WYSIWYG was a big deal. I have also used MS office during much of that time. But my WordPerfect use goes back to the DOS days and has always been my preferred word processor.<br /><br />IMHO WordPerfect is 5x's the word processor than MS Word. 2nd best won out because MS was selling the OS's and put pressure on the vendors to install office.<br /><br />But MS Office is pricing themselves out of the market for people needing to add an office suite to their computer. WordPerfect exports to all the various formats of Word or Excel. So you can save as one of the MS formats to get by in the corporate world.<br /><br />If you are looking for a strong word processor, with presentation and spreadsheet capabilities, Corel offers a very COST EFFECTIVE alternative. And for your money will be getting the superior word processor."
1,"I installed Norton Antivirus 2014 on a Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit computer.  Contrary to popular belief, this software has not degraded computer performance in any way.  No antivirus software will catch every kind of nasty on the internet, but Norton Antivirus 2014 is one of the best on the market.  As long as Norton continues to make antivirus software of this caliber, I will continue to use it.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family."
0,"Terrible quality on both the web client and desktop client. The upload speeds seem to be crippled as well, and I'm working with a lot of upload bandwidth in my testing. So far I'm seeing a max of 2.5Mbps (not megabytes per second, that's megabits per second). So at best you are able to upload just over 1GB of data per hour. Want to store that 120GB backup of your laptop? Get ready to wait for more than 5 days to have the upload finish. Oh, don't forget that there also seems to be a file size limit - so be prepared to break that backup into 10GB chunks before you upload."
1,"More than 20 years ago, I used to use Turbo Tax. After Intuit instituted a policy that I felt was unfair to consumers, I decided to switch to HR Block. I haven't looked back since.

I do know that I'm not good with layers so that will be a problem for me to understand. I am having trouble figuring some things out and the problem is I'm getting frustrated. This may well be a great program, I just wish there was one a little easier for me to understand. I'm sure if I did it everyday I would get used to it. I haven't had much time to do that but when I do, I am frustrated. I do wish he got the disc, I had to download it, and there is no instruction booklet for me to follow."

0,I have used this software for many years and been happy.  I downloaded this year's software and spent all morning entering my charitable gifts using Deduction Pro.  I saved the file and then worked on another return for my daughter.  When I went to go back to my first return it couldn't open it.  I contacted support and waited for most of an hour before someone came on.  She was in the middle of helping me when it ended the session without resolution.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  Not a big fan right now.
0,"Excel is very unresponsive at times on my brand new work computer with an i5 processor and 8 gb of ram (Everything other program works just fine). There are printing problems from Outlook I've discovered have been going on for over 6 months and still haven't been resolved. The only fix for some of the issues it appears is simply to go back to the 2010 version, unfortunately I don't have that option readily available. These are just two of a handful of issues I've found in only 3 days of working with the software.<br /><br />In short, Microsoft did a horrible disservice to its customers by releasing this product too early! I wouldn't recommend even considering buying this product until a complete service pack is released."

1,"Microsoft changed their license agreement for Office 2013 from non-transferable and tied to one PC to now you can transfer to a new computer, only once every 90 days. You can have only one license copy in use period on one computer.    [...]    This is fair enough.    There are some good updates to Office 2013. The best is probably easier working with pdf files within word. You use to have have a separate pdf program to do what you can now do in word. PDFs have been around for awhile and most people who work with pdf files already have one of these programs. For people like me this feature is well late to the party. It doesn't drive me to upgrade. I am still thinking about it.    Microsoft wants to push their web based Office 365 subscription- renting the software. Office 365 may or may not be a good deal. It depends. Office 365 is cloud base. This means you have to have a good internet connection. I really don't think the internet infrastructure is ready for the the cloud based push all big software companies want to do. If everyone goes to cloud office, movies, backup/storage, and music things are going to slow down. The primary problem is our internet connection and choices are limited with very limited competition (monopolies). The US lags far behind many other developed countries in how fast our internet speeds are and competitive pricing. Until this is fixed companies that want to do cloud base software are going to be hindered. That is though a whole different discussion.    One thing about office 2013 is you do not have to have an internet connection for access to office as it is on your desktop. Something to consider.    The positives of Office 365 as opposed to Office 2013 is it is easier for Microsoft to maintain and update. You can access and work from 5 computers on home premium license. You don't have control of the rent after 1 year so hopefully it will not go up. Office has been on a 3 year upgrade cycle/\\""new office\\"". Figure whether it is worth it for you to buy or rent."

0,"I am very disappointed with the purchase. The Amazon version does not carry Cyberlink's 30-day satisfaction guarantee. Cyberlink itself offers a big black Friday discount and is a much better deal, and comes with no-risk 30-dayt guarantee. Unfortunately, I found this out after my amazon purchase. After talking with Amazon, the sale cannot be changed. It is disappointing to know that for the same product, the vendor and amazon sell at a hugely different price and terms.    Cyberlink's customer support is terrible. They have a misleading statement on their website, stating that all their products carry 30-day satisfaction guarantee. But, they have not, intentionally, not stated that who is selling it makes a difference. After e-mailing them, they asked me to contact Amazon for refunds but the other end of circle says it cannot. Additionally, Amazon would not refund any price difference on software products once it's out of the door and the price drops.     I'd rate Cyberlink at 1 on a scale of 5 for being dishonest about their terms. Phone support is essentially nonexistent. 10-mins on a hard-find support line ended with \\""reps are too busy\\"" and good bye!    I would NOT buy any software products from Amazon again."

1,"A note: Please don't downvote this because you don't like Adobe's prices. I didn't set them, but I did spend a long time writing this to help you decide if it's worth it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />My intent here is to answer two questions: why a photographer might want Photoshop, and whether CS6 is preferable to CC. I've used Photoshop since version 4 for photography, retouching, and graphic design. Adobe has updated it ten times since. It's incredibly powerful and stable, and knowledge of it is marketable. But it's expensive and recent decisions by Adobe have complicated the value equation. I can't tell you if Photoshop is worth it, but I can describe what it'll do for you.<br /><br />DO YOU NEED IT?<br /><br />If you're a photographer, probably not. You want Lightroom.<br /><br />In the past five years, almost all of the major editing tools that photographers once used in Photoshop have migrated to Adobe Raw Converter (ACR). The ACR engine is practically an application in itself. It supports all major file types and has every color and tone control you'll ever need, as well as basic content adjustments like cloning and red-eye removal. Lightroom is ACR combined with an organizing database and batch conversion tools. It effectively replaces the former workflow, which was Adobe Bridge (a basic picture organizer), ACR (running as a separate pop-up application with batch capability), and Photoshop (for content adjustments).<br /><br />I really can't overemphasize how powerful ACR is, even with advanced functions like profiled lens corrections (e.g., CA, distortion, vignetting, perspective). If the content of the photograph is sound, there's rarely any reason to boot Photoshop.<br /><br />SO WHAT'S IT GOOD FOR?<br /><br />Quite a lot. The audience for Photoshop tends to fit into two categories: photographers, and graphic artists working in raster (pixel-based, as opposed to vector-based) formats. The typography, print, and painting engines are very powerful, as are the vector shape tools. Of greater interest to photographers are the content-adjustment tools. I'll summarize a few:<br /><br />* Clone tool - Copy one area, paste it onto another. Simple stuff. Useful to fix blemishes on an even tone or near an unwanted edge that the more powerful tools might accidentally sample. Largely superseded by the Patch tool.<br /><br />* Patch tool - Like clone, except the pasted area is blended. This and the healing brush (same thing except with a brush-engine shape and Photoshop automatically choosing the source) are the mainstay blemish-removal tools.<br /><br />* Content-aware Fill - Fills and blends the selected area with whatever Photoshop thinks should be there. It's astonishingly effective. It's replaced the clone and patch tools for large content adjustments (e.g., replacing a person or object with generic background data).<br /><br />* Content-aware Scale - Resizes a picture while keeping the proportions of important subjects. Effectively deletes or creates empty space. Useful for adapting aspect ratios.<br /><br />* Content-aware Move - A combination of the Patch tool and Content-aware Fill. Select the object, drag it elsewhere, and Photoshop blends the object into the new position and fills in the old space.<br /><br />* Vanishing Point - Cloning with perspective compensation. Expand an object (e.g., a fence or a floor) that gets larger in one direction as it gets closer to the camera.<br /><br />* Liquify - A smudge brush that works as if you were moving clay with your fingers. Every model you've ever seen was tweaked with this tool. Be fat, skinny, tall, or short. Expand the edges of your panorama. Whatever you want.<br /><br />* Puppet Warp - A more precise version of Liquify. It lets you adjust the position and shape of a particular content element without affecting the other sections. Put someone's arm at a different angle. Change the shape of a plant.<br /><br />* Dust & Scratches filter - A global adjustment filter that removes and blends everything of a particular size. Combined with layer blending modes and the History brush, it makes dust (or mole removal) almost instantaneous.<br /><br />* Lens Blur - A blurring filter that, when combined with effective masking, can give the impression of a short depth-of-field lens. Likewise for Iris Blur (simulates a LensBaby) and Tilt-Shift Blur (simulates the tilt function of a Tilt-Shift lens).<br /><br />These tools integrate with five other major abilities: masking, layers, actions, history, and Smart Objects.<br /><br />* Masking - Masking lets you selectively apply effects. Photoshop has powerful masking tools to isolate difficult content like hair. This ability is fundamental. Most of the adjustments in Lightroom are global.<br /><br />* Layers - Every adjustment in Photoshop can be stacked, masked, and reordered. Layers can be enabled or disabled as needed. With Lightroom, effect order is automatic and they all apply to a single layer.<br /><br />* Actions - Actions are macros that you can create or download to run an automated series of Photoshop functions. Sharpening, resizing, watermarking, border frames, and tone adjustments are common uses, occasionally all at once.<br /><br />* History - Everything you do is recorded in a history log. You can jump back to any point in time or branch a document to create a separate working copy.<br /><br />* Smart Objects - Smart objects retain all of the original layer data, so they can be losslessly manipulated (e.g., rotated, resized). Effects attach to the Smart Object and can be adjusted later.<br /><br />Most of these tools have no analogue in any other software collection. The short answer to the Photoshop question is this: if you just want to change the tone of your photos, Lightroom is plenty. If you want to change the content (more than just simple blemish or red-eye removal), there's no true alternative to Photoshop. Layers, history, basic masking, cloning, certain filters, sure, you can get that with Gimp. And maybe that's all you'll need. But for complex changes, Photoshop can make for a dramatically faster workflow and a far superior product.<br /><br />IS IT HARD?<br /><br />Not necessarily. There's definitely a learning curve for graphic and web design. It takes time to learn how best to use the type and vector engines, color management, image formats, and so on. Photographers have it easier, though not as easy as they do in Photoshop CC. The ACR filter in that one obviates almost all of the conventional tone and color controls. With CS6, you still have to learn which ones are useful and when. I relied overwhelmingly on Curves, Hue/Saturation, Vibrance, and every now and again, Shadow/Highlight. Everything else was in ACR on import.<br /><br />The other standard features (e.g., layers, adjustment masks) are consistent with other editors, though CS6's advanced masking may take some study. Because Photoshop is so popular, tens of thousands of tutorials, often in video form, exist to show you how to achieve specific goals. Most of these tutorials and the PSD files packaged with them will not adapt to Photoshop Elements, Gimp, or Paint Shop Pro. I would sooner buy an old version of Photoshop than to use any of those. The polish is obvious, and if you're going to go through the trouble of learning software this powerful, you might as well choose something you could get paid to know.<br /><br />CS6 or ELEMENTS 12?<br /><br />Elements is a Photoshop 7ish toolset with a simplified interface and a wide selection of one-click effects. We're missing:<br /><br />* Automation functions (HDR, contact sheets)<br />* Layer aligning and grouping<br />* Advanced color management<br />* Advanced movie support<br />* 16-bit color support (most everything requires 8-bit conversion)<br />* 64-bit code for more than 4GB of memory<br />* Smart Objects<br />* ACR advanced functions (all but basic exposure controls)<br />* Action recording<br />* Lens Correction, Liquioves and blends everything of a particular size. Combined with layer blending modes and the History brush, it makes dust (or mole removal) almost instantaneous.<br /><br />* Lens Blur - A blurring filter that, when combined with effective masking, can give the impression of a short depth-of-field lens.

It's a fairly capable content editor and most of the CS6 keyboard shortcuts carry over. There's also a Bridge-like organizer that runs as a separate program, an approach I prefer because it reduces clutter. It's well-implemented, intuitive, and capable of downloading Facebook names, so you can tag people from a recognizable list. (While it'll recognize that there is a face in a picture, it can't match similar faces like Facebook, so tagging is still a manual process.)<br /><br />Two changes orient Elements toward novices: first, it's JPEG-centric, and the impression starts in the organizer. The 'Instant Fix' options automatically create a JPEG copy of your original file, whether raw or JPEG. There's also no way (that I can find) to copy raw settings from one image to another. A typical pro shoot might have a fifty pictures that need identical white balance correction. In Bridge and Lightroom, you fix one and paste the settings elsewhere. Here, it's one picture at a time, and the raw converter (ACR) is stripped down to bare exposure and color controls.<br /><br />But when Adobe taketh, they giveth back. Elements doesn't immediately present the standard row of confusingly-vague-unnamed-icons. Instead, you get 'Quick' and 'Guided' interface options that reduce many of the basic tools to one-dimensional sliders with clear names and previews. It's only when you switch over to 'Expert' that the standard Photoshop interface appears, along with advanced features like layers, history, and actions.<br /><br />While it doesn't have Paint Shop Pro's broader feature set, Elements is easier to use and much faster with large files despite PSP's 64-bit support. Neither program does batch processing, raw adjustments, or content-generation nearly as well as CS6. Professionals will still want the full monty.<br /><br />CS6 or CS5?<br /><br />The answer to this depends on the importance you place on speed and the functionality of ACR's tone adjustment tools. Most of the changes to CS6 are behind-the-scenes. More features are GPU-accelerated (like Liquify, which could bog on slower systems and high-res files), large blocks of text can be changed more easily, and new blur tools simplify what used to take careful layer masking.<br /><br />We also have background auto-saving, better crop and patch tools, and a more capable lighting engine. Not amazing stuff, but useful. Probably the most impressive feature is the Adaptive Wide Angle filter for correcting vertical lines and distortion in wide-angle shots.<br /><br />But really, the big change for photographers is with ACR. The entire exposure adjustment engine has been overhauled. Just about all of the tone adjustment sliders work differently. I hated the changes at first, because my default workflow was to make skin tones high-key with Fill Light, and then jack the contrast to bring the blacks down. I've since learned to adjust the midtones with Exposure and use the Black slider to fix the black point. The Shadows slider is a poor substitute for Fill Light and not that useful, but in general, I've produced better results and more accurate colors faster with the new interface. I'm a convert.<br /><br />CS6 or PAINT SHOP PRO X6?<br /><br />Paint Shop Pro could be an alternative if (a) you work with small files, and (b) they don't require content adjustments you couldn't achieve with the clone tool. The features that PSP duplicates (vectors, fonts, layers, color management, etc.) tend to be less sophisticated than CS6's equivalents, but you won't often miss the difference. Both are very powerful.<br /><br />Here's what you lose in broad strokes:<br /><br />* Smart Objects<br />* Content synthesis tools (e.g., perspective cloning, content-aware anything)<br />* Program-wide 16-bit support<br />* Speed<br />* Adobe Raw Converter and Bridge<br />* Integration with Adobe products<br />* All the perks that come with being 'the standard' (e.g., tutorials, compatibility with client files)<br /><br />If you're a photographer, ACR is a big deal. It's no small thing to do the majority of your edits in a fast and simple metadata-based tool. Nor can I discount CS6's massive speed advantage with large files. If you're designing for web or your project layers don't crest the double-digits, PSP is probably fast enough. But it wasn't much fun with my 5D II raw files.<br /><br />CS6 OR CC?<br /><br />Ordinarily this wouldn't merit discussion, but Adobe has changed the pricing scheme for Photoshop CC. With Adobe CS6 and prior, the Adobe suite and individual applications were available for permanent purchase. Buy once, use forever. Adobe CC is only available by subscription. You pay for the duration you use it, usually month to month. This has ups and downs for individual users.<br /><br />(+) Initial cost is less. CS6 is north of $600. Now you can get Photoshop for $10-$20 a month.<br />(+) Your software is always current. When the next version of Photoshop comes out, you get it.<br />(+) Settings and content are in the cloud, so migrating to new installations takes less effort.<br /><br />(-) Long-term cost is potentially more, depending on whether you would ordinarily buy every update. If not, the break-even for this particular package is around 2.5 years.<br />(-) Multi-app packages are less flexible, so you may end up paying for apps you don't use.<br />(-) Pricing isn't necessarily fixed. Very little stops Adobe from raising rates later.<br />(-) If you stop paying, the software stops working. Given that this would probably coincide with a business downturn, you would lose access to your work at the worst possible time.<br />(-) The software has to contact the licensing server once a month. It'll work offline for 99 days. After that, you're SOL.<br />(-) Adobe seems to have trouble guarding their passwords. Your passwords.<br /><br />That's the stick. The carrot is the collection of new features in CC. We've got a new camera shake blur reducer that I didn't find terribly effective, a radial blur tool, new resizing algorithms that don't improve much on standard Bicubic, 3D painting refinements I didn't try, a new 'Reduce Noise' slider in the Smart Sharpen box that doubles as a skin blemish remover, and the long-awaited ability (for web designers) to adjust the corner radius of a vector box shape. Not much of this blows my skirt up.<br /><br />Except for one thing: you can now apply the ACR engine as a filter. And if it's on a Smart Object, it's losslessly adjustable. That's huge. This one feature almost totally obviates the tone and color controls in Photoshop for general use, along with the separate filters for vignetting, lens correction, and so on. And because the ACR interface is far better integrated than the rest of Photoshop, it substantially lowers the learning curve.<br /><br />CS6 can apply ACR to non-raw file types, but not natively within Photoshop. You have to force the raw converter to open these files. The ACR interface presents only once on the initial opening. It's an awkward workflow and destructive because you can't make changes after import. To me, this single feature is more compelling than every new addition since Content-Aware Fill.<br /><br />ACR itself also has a few additions of note in CC: the patch tool and new perspective corrections. The patch tool is lossless and editable like everything else in ACR, unlike Photoshop's version. The perspective corrections are similar to the Adaptive Wide Angle feature that debuted in CS6. They automatically correct proportions and vertical lines. It's hard to describe, but architecture and interior photographers will love it.<br /><br />IN SUM:<br /><br />As a content editor, Photoshop CS6 is in a class by itself. CC is even better. If you need the fastest workflow, advanced content-adjustment algorithms, and integration with Adobe products, there's no substitute.<br /><br />But maybe you don't need all that. If you're a photographer, Lightroom has global adjustments (and some light content-correction like cloning and red-eye reduction) covered. Photoshop Elements 12, Paint Shop Pro, and Photoshop 7 onward do simple content-editing (and text layouts, vector art, and painting) just fine. The major adjustment with Adobe CS 8.0 and above was the progressive addition of 16-bit file support. JPEGs are 8-bit. You don't even need 16-bit for corrections that don't torture the histogram.<br /><br />Given the cost disparity, it's worth starting with a $60 copy of PSP or Elements 12. If they work for you, great. If not, you'll have to weigh whether your use scenario merits a large upfront cost or a smaller continuous dole. Adobe will let you trial Photoshop CS6 and Photoshop CC for a month. The right choice is partly a question of mindset: if each new Photoshop release has you salivating, CC is the best choice. If not, CS6 will be a better deal midway through the third year.<br /><br />Adobe actually has a free download of the entire CS2 suite with activation keys, though it's on your honor that you bought CS2. Make of that what you will."

I prefer drag and drop. Other than that, I haven't found any issues with 11 and it responds much like CS5. In some ways, I like it better than CS5 - for one, 11 has a solid background, which I prefer, rather than a transparent background as in CS5. I am using an IMac."

0,"Bought this program 1 week ago, due to the positive reports on detection rates. Well, it may be great at detection, but it is an incredible system resource hog! When it downloads or updates it uses 90-98% of system resources. While these processes are running it is impossible to connect to the internet or download e-mail or even open programs. It got worse and worse over the course of a week until I finally decided to terminate the program ($29.95 down the drain). Then I discovered that I needed a special program to even remove it. Windows Uninstall won't cut it. It laughs at uninstall. When I finally managed to get it off my computer everything returned to normal. This &#34;anti-virus&#34; is WORSE than a virus.

1,"I like it for what it is.  It's not a Mint.com or CreditKarma or anything like that.  In fact it's more of a stand alone that can't go online and check anything for you.  This is a simple &#34;bill tracker&#34; that you use to get all your incoming and outgoing in one place.  You can see what's coming due, past due, total amount due, total balance, dates, etc.  At a glance I can see what I owe for everything together, which amount is highest, lowest, due first, due last, etc.  It's nice to play around with it from time to time to remind yourself about your goals.  Personally I shoot for the lowest first.  As for the software, you input the amounts, it has no ability to go to the websites for a real time status.  I use my credit card to pay my bills every month because I like to work up my reward points, and I can't stand being late so I let my billers take it off the card.  This means I have to go in about every 2 weeks and manually verify and input the new balances of my cars, loans, bills, etc.  That would be such a great option but I know of no software that communicates with every account out there.  Mint doesn't talk to a third of the bill companies I have, Quicken is even worse and way too complicated.  Chronicle sinks well with my I-Phone so I get calendar updates and reminders.  Very easy to use, little frills however.  This is way better than just trying to remember what bills you have or keeping it all on scratch paper or that file you never quite empty."

1,I've used Quicken for years. It just keeps improving.
0,"TurboTax Deluxe meets your basic needs, but is, in my view, still very expensive for what you get.  It is still a series of questions that you have to answer.  You still have to do all the research and find all the numbers for your deductions, income, etc.  You still have to want to document how much your car registrations were.  The tool is thorough and good at asking all the questions to maximize your refund or minimize your additional tax payment.  It also provides fairly good explanations about the questions in case they are confusing.<br />For entry of the basic tax information and moving through your return I give this tool high marks.  However, when you go off script and want to jump around, it becomes more difficult to use.  There seems to be a big push to file electronically.  This is fine for the federal return since that cost is included, however, filing electronically for state is another $20 (ridiculous when you are making it easier for everyone involved in the tax process).  For this reason I still mail my state return when I really do not want to.  Every year, I have to spend extra time trying to figure out how to print my state return to send.  Why they do not have a button right where you file electronically to allow you to print the return for mailing I find disturbing.  You can spend $20 in time trying to figure out how to do this because TT refuses to make it easy.<br /><br />Overall, OK, good enough, but overpriced and always looking to increase company revenue rather than user experience."
0,"After begrudgingly giving up Microsoft Money because it had stopped being supported years ago, I took the plunge with Quicken 2015. It was able to import my accounts from Money but I had to do some fairly extensive clean up on a few of them. The interface is decent and easy to use. My big disappointment is how unstable the program is. It seems to crash at least once or twice a week. Money almost never crashed or froze up. Sigh."
0,This version is not long working. Amazon should delist it or at least explicitly specify the main function is no longer working. The whole purpose I purchased it is to let it download my data from eTrade. But the window has already expired. So the main function of this software is no long working. Completely useless for me. I have uninstalled it. Please issue me a full refund.
1,awesome product for home pc protection :)
1,It works for me better than the 2011 because it finally has a Journal Entry previous and next button.  Still I would suggest that when requesting a register that a pop up screen asks for which account register similar to when reconciling the user is asked to choose the account to reconcile.  I cannot find a way to increase the screen font size.  It is very small.
1,"I started using avast! Free Antivirus years ago when I heard Kim Komando recommend it on her radio show. Ten years later, I am still trusting avast! to protect my laptop, and now my Android phone. I have never experienced a problem, and on occasion, avast saved me from going to an infected page. Everyone in my family uses it, and I even have my Mac friends protecting their machines with the Mac version.<br /><br />Two years ago, I became an avast employee. It's great to work with a product that I believe in. I highly recommend avast! Free Antivirus."
0,It messed up my computer and now I can't even uninstall it
0,"Years ago a abandoned Paintshop Pro after Coral bought it and put out an upgrade that wasn't an upgrade.  When I needed video editing software VideoStudio Ultimate had some good reviews and the price was right, so I set aside my long ago anger and downloaded the trial version.  Oops, it wasn't the trial version of Ultimate, it was VideoStudio Pro.  No, I didn't just hit the wrong button.  I checked and the big print says trial version, but the small print says you are really getting Pro.<br /><br />Having been around awhile, I was a little concerned that when I download the Ultimate version, there would be a problem.  But I liked the product and wanted the stabilization feature of Ultimate (although I did not have any chance to test it).  So I bought Ultimate -- not much difference in the price--here and downloaded it.  I looked on Coral's web site for anything about installing Ultimate over a trial copy of Pro; nothing.  So I just installed it.  Luckily, it automatically uninstalls Pro, but there is no way to know that until it just happens.<br /><br />Now, when I downloaded Ultimate, there are actually to setup files.  One just says something like Ultimate setup.  The other one says something like Ultimate setup bonus.  Checked the website and again nothing.  So I installed the first one thinking that the second one is something you add after the first one.  That is apparently wrong.  They are apparently two different versions of the program.  But here is the rub.  When installing the first one, I entered my registration number as requested.  So when I started the bonus one and it was going to reinstall Ultimate, I thought it may not let me enter the registration number again (I have had a similar issue with installing Windows after a disk crash).  Nothing about it on the website, of course.<br /><br />And guess what, it does not appear that Ultimate actually has any of the extras.  I opened it and it does not have any reference to any added features.  The manualthat you can get on the website turns out to also only be for Pro.  And there is no way to ask, without wasting my one support ticket (and you and I both know that what I will get back is some canned do the following 5 things to cure the problem)<br /><br />Coral is just so weird about not giving a **** about their customers."
1,We purchased two licenses rather than go with 360 and be stuck paying rent forever after calulating the breakeven point. Easy to download and install. We moved many documents over from our old Windows PCs and at first had some difficulties working with them as we are just getting familiar with our new Macs. Make sure to go to the Adobe website and download the free reader to work with your pdf documents.
0,I just purchased the download butI don't have the ability to work on documents offline. I feel like I've been cheated. What happens if I lose internet connectivity (I use wifi so there are times when the internet has to be reset. I would be unable to do any work offline)? I would have purchased 2010 if I'd known. I so tired of Corporate America duping consumers into paying more for less.
0,Since Upgrading to Premier 2014 from 2013 my checking account crashes when I exceed 10660 transactions.  I have important history recorded in this account and now its worthless.  I am terribly frustrated.
1,"Downloaded easily to my computer. No problems of any kind, however its best to sign up with a Microsoft account before downloading.  Just make sure you READ the system requirements before purchasing and check if its compatible with your system."
0,"the program have string limitation on Health Care Information carrier field.<br />and my insurance company name happened to be  &#34;Massachusetts XXXX Administrators LLC&#34;.<br />so instead sending the full string number, the software decide to truncate it .......<br />the my state return is rejected because this string truncated error."
1,Always easy and thorough.  Feel very confident my tax return is correct and accurate. Will certainly recommend and use TurboTax again.
1,Excellent value for the price.  No problems with it and Amazon makes it very easy to download and redownload (if your system happens to need replaced).
1,"Quicken has improved spectacularly since I used it last (prior to 2000). Download to working mode took just a few minutes with all my expenditures categorized. Amazing.

1,"Upgraded from LR 2.3 to 6 because I'm shooting more in RAW now. I can't say enough wonderful things about how much better 6 is than the older versions, it was like going from the driver's seat in a diesel Rabbit to an Audi A8. Holy smokes this program makes photo processing so fast and so easy!<br /><br />If you're new to Lightroom (or to this new version), I highly recommend online training by Lydia, it only takes a few hours to get up to speed on nearly everything this powerful program offers."

1,"We have purchased this from our warehouse store the past couple of years but just kept forgetting to pick it up this year (Ok, really we just kept telling ourselves we had time and we would get it next time.)  The download was easy and fast.  We didn't take advantage of the bonus offer but I am now kicking myself for not doing it for at least a portion of our refund."
1,"Seems to be working great, but then I don't look at porn, so I'm not so vulnerable."
1,Excellent price. I will get again in a future. Will recommend to my Friends and relatives. This is so great an Thank you again!
1,"After getting the product downloaded with some difficulty it seems to work OK.  I have used Quicken for about 20 years so have had to update every few years to maintain functionality.  It is annoying that functions are moved around with no apparent reason.  It always takes a while to find where things are.  For example, I regularly use the \\""find\\"" function to locate previous payments to a particular payee.  I have yet to find this function on Q2013."
0,"2012 version worked great - had to update to 2015 to kepe my online merchant services working - now it crashes often, requred me to get new computers, has data corruptions, and is overall much less friendly to use - requires larger monitors to see the same amount of data, and is easier to make mistakes in."
0,"None of us have filed tax returns for 2014 yet, so every review of the product to this point is a pre-review.  I haven't purchased TurboTax Deluxe yet, and probably will not do so this year.  On a personal level, I am unsettled about all of the really negative reviews of Intuit Turbotax, but they are consistent with my own observations of TurboTax through the years.  TurboTax is expensive, and I can't understand why the prices are so high.  Intuit has a large share of the accounting and tax return business already, and doing tax returns is not rocket science anymore.  Yeah, the crummy federal tax laws are intentionally complicated, the states are all different, and technology is changing a bit, but when you are a big established company like Intuit, if you can't keep up, maybe you should be doing something else.    From the customer's perspective, I see a lot of long time customers being frustrated by this year's TurboTax, especially the Deluxe version.  Why is that?  Why not give more for less?  Does Intuit think they own the market and can charge whatever the hell they want to charge?  Does that make any sense?  Yes, we Americans are all 'enjoying' the economic depression imposed on us by a runaway and lawless federal government and a criminal federal reserve banking system, and our personal and business costs are rising every single year.  A full restaurant dinner in 1970 was about $.80 - today it is over $8.00.  We can thank the fed and their co-conspirators in the federal government for that problem.    I'm sure that, like us, Intuit's costs are also rising, but it seems that this year they will be losing many customers.  Ooops.  Did they mean for that to happen?  As an aside, I just briefly reviewed the H&R software, and guess what - there is a TurboTax import capability and the H&R Deluxe cost is apparently much less than TurboTax Deluxe.  Do you think many TurboTax customers are going to be looking for alternative tax returns this year?  It would seem that way.    Anyway, I don't mean to rant on and on, but I am beginning to think someone at Intuit has screwed the pooch on this one.  Onward and sideways as the old expression used to say?  Let's all of us keep talking and reviewing this kind of software as our needs and goals are clearly different than those of Intuit and H&R.  Competition is good for everyone, and there appear to be no sacred cows in the tax preparation business anymore.    Another aside, I keep waiting for people to start asking why, if Americans only deal in fiat, debt based currency, and have no real wealth, profit, or income anymore, is there any obligation to file tax returns in the first place.  But, hey, maybe that's just poor dumb me asking.  ;-)  Happy New Year!"
1,I had a problem installing it.<br />I called Norton. They were very helpful.<br />They uninstalled it and re-installed it.<br />It works fine now. No problems.<br />Easy to use. I will keep it.

1,"I just completed downloading the download version of Turbo Tax Home and Business.  It took approximately 15 minutes from start to finish. The Amazon Downloader tool and the download version of Turbo Tax Home and Business downloaded without any problems.  I was leary to purchase this from the comments made, however, I DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS!  It is tax time and many of us are wanting to download this product over the weekend.  That is why I am taking the time to write this review...buy it..it is safe and easy to download.  Thank you Amazon.  Paula From Florida!"

I tried everything, but the log-in screen was frozen.<br /><br />Two hours of heavy calculations - that by the way were only on turbotax, nowhere else, and it completely loses all of my information. I haven't been this angry in over a year... I will be looking for an alternative next year to Turbotax."

Don't think that I will purchase 'downloads' anymore.<br /><br />Everett L. Rust"
1,I chose Avast! because it was recommended by a computer tech friend. It has helped prevent several viruses by warning me of them and allowing me to delete and clear them before they harmed my computer.

1,Got to have for work and this makes my life much easier. I upgraded from professional 9 and there are some great new additions and it does take some getting used to but all the oldies are there just in a prettier and easier to use (after you get used to it) format.
0,"How did this product get released?<br /><br />After reading many negative reviews about this latest version a couple months ago I decided that I'd investigate Mac-native financial applications. After all, maybe it was time to shut down my last remaining reason to run a Windows partition. (The Mac version of Quicken didn't even make to evaluation stage by the way.) After some hopeful forays into the brave new world of Mac financial apps, alas nothing compared to the overall functionality of Quicken. The quest failed.<br /><br />Go back; read the reviews again. Come on, it can't be that bad. These people must be newbies; without the 10+ years (I won't admit to the actual number) of experience with Quicken I have. How could you possibly take a perfectly fine 2011 version and three years later destroy fundamental capability and not add any substantial new features? Can't be accurate. Decision made - download the 2014 version of Quicken Home and Business edition.<br /><br />That was last week.<br /><br />First attempt: update all accounts. Application hangs repeatedly. Accounts that previously worked fine with online services now report errors. &#34;Password incorrect...please log in to &#60;choose your bank&#62; online services first.&#34; So...I do. Appears that the password is correct. Recopy the password and paste directly into the dialogue box. &#34;Password Incorrect.&#34; Troubleshoot. &#34;Try again in few days.&#34; Try again in a few days. &#34;Try again in a few days.&#34; Try to update accounts separately...&#34;Password incorrect&#34;.<br /><br />And it continues.<br /><br />So I go back to my fundamental question about my motive to &#34;upgrade&#34;. Why did I bother? Well...turns out that if I wanted any online services to work, I had to. You see, Intuit decided the best way to turn a perpetual licence into recurring revenue was to shut off the most important feature of the application (online services) in the 2011 edition. That's a three-year term on my perpetual license. What's it going to be next year, Intuit? Two years? One year?<br /><br />If you want to make the switch to recurring revenue, take the hit like they all did (Adobe, Microsoft, etc.) and tell the customer the truth. You want their money every year. They will respect you more for it in the long run.<br /><br />In the mean time, please make this version work. It was a &#34;Go To Market&#34; decision, so at the end of the day I don't blame the engineers. But I do blame Intuit. How much does it take to lose a long-term customer? You may be plumbing the depths of that question with this release."
0,"The program does what it's supposed to do and the mix of games into the learning process does make it less tedious. However, the presentation looks and feels extremely dated. The graphical elements are fairly poor, but the biggest issue I have is that it doesn't scale up in resolution at all. On my 1080P monitor, the program resides in a non-resizeable window that maybe takes up maybe 1/6th of the screen. I don't find that at all acceptable.<br /><br />I'm going to try to get some use of it, but if I could return it for a refund, I would."
1,"I had bought my wife a prior backup program.  We couldn't figure out what it saved because it encoded all the data it purportedly saved.  She gave up on it.  I got a hard drive and a Clickfree Automatic Backup software program.  She was reluctant to use it, but we finally installed it.  Once in a while I would hook up the external hard drive and do a backup.  Then the hard drive failed. :-(<br /><br />We had some priority files we needed from the old computer so I hooked up our old netbook to the external hard drive.  Not sure what I'd find, but Clickfree creates a little retrieval program right on the hard drive.  It allows you to restore all or part of your image, to the old location or to a new location you can specify.  Best of all, you can actually do your search easily and see if the files are there!  I retrieved the files I needed easily and did what I needed to do.<br /><br />Next, we got a different computer, and I was able to set up a complete restore in a matter of minutes; the restore completed in less than two hours.  My only problem was that the new computer didn't have the same partitioning as the old one so I had a few things to process manually.  But they were all there, it all worked!<br /><br />My only complaints are minor.  There is apparently some limit on the length of pathnames for restores; I had some long folder names and had to shorten them to get the selective restore to work.  The other small issue is that Clickfree offers to use anything you plug in as a backup drive.  This includes memory sticks, iPods, etc.  There's probably some way to specify what the backup drive is wanted, but it is a little annoying to have to tell it \\""no, don't use this\\"" every time you plug in a different device.  Still, the restore worked great when I needed it, and that's the real objective of a backup program."
0,This program states it will recover hard drives so far it has recovered absolutely nothing for me after a drive failure and the drive not being formatted but found by the OS.  It kept complaining about a corrupt system on the drive.  Even after formatting it against my better judgment it still can find nothing.  This is not a data recovery program more like a deleted file when everything is working perfectly program.
1,The price for Turbo Tax was very good.  The program was very helpful and easy to understand.  Also you have the ability to make corrections.
0,False advertising.  Had to pay for state efiling!  Was not free

1,Turbo Tax is the BEST!
1,I have used this software for about 15 years.  I love the ease of operation and the set up.  I am a novice computer user and recently I had to upgrade the software.  I had trouble loading the new version.  The customer service and tech service was the best I have ever dealt with.  Their patience with me and my naivete with computer language was top notch.  One tech service gentleman jumped into my computer - an eye opening and incredibly neat experience - to load it into my computer.  Then they were able to retrieve the data I had lost.  I couldn't be happier.  for those of us who spend time being frustrated with our computers this is one company that diminishes that frustration with polite and patient employees.  And the best part is I could understand every word and didn't have to keep asking them to repeat what they had said.  Thanks Individual Software.

0,"This is for folks like me who are filing last minute and wondering how the H&R software compares to Turbo Tax (TT).  If you are not knowledgeable about tax rules, DO NOT GET THIS SOFTWARE.  I read reviews from many sources that said this asks the user many questions to guide you, just as does TT. True, but TT asks questions that are more basic and don't require knowledge of the laws, as noted above.  If you click help in H&R, it is very non-descriptive and may suggest you go look at the IRS publication.  Further, I had understood there was a feature allowing the user to flag areas he/she wants to revisit, and make notes. Due to the need for me to consult an online or live person, I looked for this flag but cannot find it.  Very annoying, I wish I had just gotten TT."
1,"Have been using it for about 6 years now. Started when I installed it in a business environment for my clients, now I use it for personal use as well.  It's free, it does a wonderful job at keeping your computer virus free, and is very light on system resources compared to other A/V programs.  What's not to like?<br /><br />However, it doesn't protect from some malware or spyware programs, so if you want protection for those as well, either purchase the full (internet security or other), or compliment this program with another like malwarebytes' anti malware.<br /><br />Either way, it's a great choice!"
0,"Quicken Premier 2014 is my first Quicken experience. I read the poor reviews but decided to download today anyway because 98% of the time software things go smooth for me even when reviewers complain. Well, it crashed within the first 5 minutes of using the software when connecting to my first bank account. I expected that account to be the easiest too. Then it crashed again for my 401k.  Not happy. If I have more problems I will complain and return."
0,They underhandedly raised the prices on me half way through my return. I called and spent an hour on the phone with them and they were unhelpful. They also removed some features from the Deluxe software and are charging even more for the same thing I bought last year.Went to H&R Block software and it was more than half the price. I used to be a customer of Turbotax: NEVER AGAIN!
1,"The version being sold on Amazon is 2010 (as of 8/8/13), just like it shows on the box. I spoke to someone there who verified this.

0,"Oh, where do I start!  Visio was more setup like a drawing tool with many shortcut buttons that can be put on a bar.  This is similar to a painter and his palette where he could access his paints (tools) with a single click.  Now, you have a ribbon that makes no logical sense as to where the tools should be placed.  For instance, they placed the \\""Snap and Glue\\"" under \\""View\\"".  To make any changes to \\""Snap and Glue\\"" properties, you need to click into the Ribbon.  This will not allow you to quickly alter the \\""Snap and Glue\\"" tools and the various properties without going back and forth several times.  Anyone who has used \\""Snap\\"" or \\""Glue\\"" when connecting lines is aware \\""why\\"" this is an issue.<br /><br />This is just one of many issues that Microsoft has made to the program.  You can add a lot of these functions individually, but this requires a lot of work.  As I was selecting individual features, I ran into issues of not knowing the group of tools names.  This made it difficult to find everything I wanted to use.<br /><br />It seems that Microsoft did not interview a single user that uses Visio professionally as part of their role.  Thanks, IAL"
1,Avast is one of the best. The free is good but the premium is great. You can do a trial base and check it out yourself. I really like it.

1,"Alright, I have had enough of reading the bad reviews on this product, so ridiculous, too many cheapskates! Common people support your product!<br /><br />I have been using Turbotax for over 10 years. I always buy premier ($54.99 - cheaper than going to tax man, what a steal !) version just to cover everything. NO issues like everyone is complaining about. My computer is about 2 years old but has all of Windows 8.1 updates. So no issues downloading Turbo Tax and installing it. I downloaded it today, installed it and selected to install ALL updates immediately.<br /><br />On the extra charges side, I think people are referring to the extra $39.99 charge for Premium (at the end when you are ready to electronically submit) which includes free audit protection and Turbo Tax will deal with any audits you get and help you. Also there was always a $19.99 charge for e-file to get your refund in 5 days, so no difference there, always have to pay that if you choose to e-file<br /><br />I paid a total of $114.97 for everything, which is a steal and cheaper than the tax man, and from the comfort of my own home!<br /><br />So breaking it down: $54.99 for this download, $19.99 for E-file (Get refund in 6 days), and an extra $39.99 for premium which includes free audit protection, all coming to a grand total of $114.97.<br /><br />What do I have to complain about? NOTHING!! Software and Technology rules!! Support your product and pay for your well written software that is beautifully written to do what it's supposed to do, well worth every penny. People just want everything for free, and don't want to pay anything for the service, way to go Turbo Tax!!!! Forget about H.R. Block they suck, they will never have a product better than Turbotax.<br /><br />I did my taxes today for $114.97 with Audit Protection from the comfort of my own home and will be deposited by next week from e-file. I will continue to always use Turbo Tax every year and support them no matter what, because all other tax software and places can't compare.<br /><br />10 stars for you Turbo Tax, keep up the great work!!"
1,"Office is still the best and staple product for any business, small or large. As an IT Consultant who has, at customer's suggestion, tried various products in their business and they have all gone back to Microsoft Office. It's the easiest and most seamless product on the market... the price isn't bad either."
1,"Really LOVE this software!!  I watched the general overview training video and was up and running.  GREAT program and super easy to use.  If I ever run into a snag, I can Google my question and/or check out the additional training videos.  Fun application. :)"
0,"I have had Quicken when Microsoft discontinued support. T first Quicken seemed ok, but since then Quicken has \\""improved' ? this product. Why Why mess with things when the product works. A mechanic said to me once, when working on my car \\""If it works, don't try to fix it\\"" The 15 version has duplicated account names each with a changed name,and also changed checking account balances. Microsoft, where are you now when you are needed?<br /><br />This 2015 version of Quicken was purchased from Amazon as a download-I wish that I had decided to order a disc version,rather than a downloaded version"

1,This is the first time I have ever recommend a product on any forum.  I recently purchase the WealthTrace software and have been extremely pleased with it.  Before I bought the WealthTrace program I tried the Turbo Technologies software.  After awhile I discovered that the Turbo Technologies program was so inflexible that the results it provided were misleading.  (Meaning that it showed I would have far more money in retirement than what was realistic.)<br /><br /> I could go on and on about the numerous advantages of the WealthTrace program.  I guess the best way to sum it up is that it is a vastly superior product and based upon what I paid for it in comparison to what the Turbo Technologies software - WealthTrace is a real bargain.
0,Better than 2010 but that doesn't say much. Reporting is cumbersome. It frequently makes a mess of downloads.<br />I spend way to much time fixing muffed reconciliations. That said it finally includes the value of one of my investments that 2010 would never do.....
0,"I had used Avast on my mobile device awhile back and it was fine so I thought I would give it a try as it's for free. I felt it slowed down my system and as others have pointed it there are a lot of pop ups. I also found it changing things without permissions intrusive. Sadly not what it used to be. I was on Windows 8 at the time I downloaded Avast (have changed to 8.1 since) so perhaps it works better on other systems, but I just didn't care for the direction Avast has taken in its product development."
1,"It's great except for the annoying notifications for example; your updates are critical. No they are not critical, Bing,Windows Essentials, and a few other things from Microsoft."
0,"Imported Microsoft Money fairly well.  It had issues with the first balancing of all accounts and did not bring across the payment types very well for the accounts paid on-line.  Also had some issues with initial downloading of statements and importing the transactions into the accounts.<br /><br />I only converted from Money because some of the accounts I download statements from discontinued the Money formatted transfer file.  Quicken tries to cram everything about a single transaction onto a single line, consequently much of the information is not readable unless you expand the field, which then causes you to have to scroll along the line to see more information.  Very similar to an Excel spreadsheet.  Money presented the transactions on multiple lines which made it much easier to read and manage."
0,Slowed my PC way down!
1,Avast has protected my computers since 2010 and has caught things that Norton & Macafee missed and is up to date on all the new viruses

0,Hav not actually made use of it 2 produce trainng videos YET!!  So I dnt thnk I cn giv a fair eval YET!  ;-)
1,Truly makes my life easier doing my own taxes.
1,This is Light on cpu and bandwith.  Yet it is comprehensive to defend against most malware.  I would recommend it.
1,"Norton Internet Security is the ONLY anti-virus software I trust for my PCs. Sure, it costs a bit more than most of those other competitors, but my peace-of-mind is worth it! New features include &#34;Safe Web&#34; which checks each website for validity and security; &#34;Identity Safe&#34; which can manage your passwords; and a Symantec website you can use to check the validity of a suspect URL. It even gives you a map of your home network. Many more features are included.  I highly recommend!!"
1,"A super simple way to prepare your taxes.  Minutes rather than hours and although I wasn't able to submit, it is because the proper forms haven't been released by the IRS yet."
1,this IBM version much better than the 2007 version for Mac we owned previously
1,Awesome software :&#62; It was very engaging! Really enjoyed the kana memory games and the culture inserts.
1,"liked it very simple and easy to use, it lived up to everything i thought it would be thank you"
1,I feel very secure with Avast preventing serious threats from getting on my computer.
1,"have been shopping around for a good price and found it at amazon  ,easy to download and will check this out for next year ."
0,"I read all the reviews and was little bit out of my mind and still took my chances.  McAfee is a scam they have some bug which does not allow you to install and their technicians are of no use, they act as if they tried everything and then ask you go pay 89 buck for their real service, why should I pay? Its a horrible feeling when you get cheated"
0,"Used this for our taxes this year. While it saved us some money doing it ourselves, there were still some parts that were extremely confusing to someone that isn't used to doing taxes by themselves. I think we'll save the headache and have someone else do them next year."
1,This was a very easy and inexpensive way for me to renew my subscription with McAfee. I found the download to be easy and fast. I recommend purchasing your McAfee products this was and saving money.
1,"I bought the download version of this product, which I do not recommend doing, ever. I feel that if I would have bought the physical copy, I would probably give this a five star rating. The product itself is great, it's very nice to work with. But, the download version is terrible in that if you need to reformat your laptop, you just threw away a lot of money. When I called the customer service they informed me that I would have to buy it once again, but that I would only have to buy it for $100 this time, a whole $50 discount, so generous considering I got to use the program for a whopping six months. But yes, if you are going to spend the money on a Microsoft product, always have a physical copy, lesson learned."
0,"If TurboTax doesn't include Schedule D in next year's Deluxe software as they did in the past, I will be looking for a new software."
1,I have always used Norton and trust them completely.
1,"Hello guys. After reading all the bad reviews I decided that I had no choice but upgrade my Q. to the newer version.<br />Well...<br />I'm former user of Microsoft Money, and currently had 2011 addition (which I bought not new, being afraid of the bad reviews on the new addition of the Quicken).<br />Seeing so much bad said about the software, I decided to switch to another one. Alas!!!! there is no similar product available on market. At least yet. And the ones I that came close, did not have wonderful reviews either.<br />Having all considered, I was hoping that sooner or later they will come forward and fix the bugs. So I decided to upgrade to 2014.<br />To my astonishment. The program not only have not crashed a single time, but it also have now several features that fixed the problems that I had in past. And made it much easier to use. Well it is about the desktop version of it. But let me tell you the mobile app is a blow out!!!!!<br />I now have transactions update in real time. No need to go to ATM to check balance, or see if transaction posted. It tells me every thing. Balance, credit remaining and more. Very nice addition to the software!!!<br />Well that is it. I might change it later if something goes wrong. But apart from some minor incapability issues at this point I have not experienced even a single problem. Took me a bit time to play with it, get it set up, figured out.<br />Now it all works perfectly. Got my finances under control !!!"
1,I've been using it for years.  I try to keep up with the &#34;It's Deductable&#34; because it transfers right to my form when needed.
1,"I have used Quicken for 12 years, and that comment alone makes me feel really old.  That said, I've seen the evolution of both the PC and Mac versions.  And I've also read enough reviews to know that folks go crazy every time a new version is released.  Some functionality is lost, some changes, and some cool stuff is added.  Two years later, the people who scorched the old version are its staunchest defenders (when the next version is released).  With all of that as background, I like this streamlined version of Quicken for Mac.  But there are some things that I am still getting used to (2 months later).  And it wouldn't be a Quicken product if there weren't 2 or 3 issues that drove us all nuts.  Pros * As I mentioned above, I like the &#34;less is more&#34; movement with Quicken.  This product was originally geared to &#34;numbers people&#34; like me, who want tons of data at their immediate disposal.  Along with the ability to customize nearly everything.  With the last few updates, you can tell they are trying to cast a wider net and make a program that the rest of the populace can use (and understand).  I'm willing to give up a little, for a more streamlined application overall. * Moving the full list of accounts to the left, and burying the &#34;Overview&#34; section to the bottom was a good move.  This way, I can see my total net worth and balances by account all the time.  I have never found the Overview section to be very helpful.  That is certainly something they need to work on.  The front page of Mint.com is much more useful. * Within each account, I like how the transactions view is the default.  This allows me (as a &#34;numbers guy&#34;) to see the raw detail.  But nested within each account, you can click on &#34;Spending&#34; or &#34;Income&#34; and get a graphical breakdown by category.  Not a function I use all of the time, but it's nice to have it there.  And nicer to have it tucked away when I don't need it. * I still like the ability to reconcile accounts, to ensure no transactions were missed during a download.  And the ability to see the expected balance, if you are using the &#34;Bill Reminders&#34; function (which is great). * There is the ability to create custom reports, but I like how it is nested in the left-side column.  Again, there if you need it, but not as obtrusive as it used to be. * The &#34;Budget&#34; function is much more robust, when you compare to Quicken's sister-product Mint.com. * Compared to Mint, I find it easier to manage older accounts in Quicken.  You can delete a single account in Quicken (say, an old mortgage account with your bank).  Whereas that isn't possible in Mint.  Small issue, but I like to keep Quicken clutter-free.  Cons * Aesthetically speaking, I don't like the grey and white color scheme.  A little bit of color would be nice, especially to separate certain sections of each screen.  Mint.com's setup is much more visually appealing. * The number of financial institutions supported (even compared to Mint) is much lower in Quicken.  I have no idea why that is the case, given that Quicken is an older product.  There are two accounts where I have to manually download a file, then import to Quicken.  And another (a 529 Plan) which didn't support Quicken at all.  That has been a continuous hassle, even dating back to older Quicken versions (both PC and Mac). * I like how Mint uses 3rd party companies like Zillow and KBB to track the value of homes and autos.  I wish Quicken would do the same. * I wish Quicken would incorporate more recommendations.  For instance, on my brokerage accounts.  Maybe a comparison to a benchmark (Russell 2000, S&P 500, etc.).  I do like that they have the current balances, a graphical view of the change in value, and the total gain/loss (assuming you enter a cost basis).  But I would like to see a way to highlight under-performing assets. * For loan accounts, I wish they would break down the payments between the interest and principal.  Granted, you can do this manually.  But the default assumption is that the entire payment reduces the principal balance.  Which makes the balance look artificially low.  Bottom line - I think the streamlined views in Quicken for Mac 2015 are a step in the right direction.  But it still feels like a &#34;stand-alone&#34; program.  Not as dynamic as Mint.com.  In future releases, I'd like to see more movement into that area.  Recommendations, maybe even product offerings (assuming it would reduce the price tag of this software).  Heck, maybe even a social component which would allow for the free flow of ideas on how to best utilize this program."
0,"Not impressed with this version of Quicken.  Seems like all they do is move items around, making they same task you have been doing for years harder and harder to find and use.  This version locked up during the install and again during the update.  It has also locked up during a couple of banking updates.  I'm running this on a 1 year old Dell desktop, so it isn't a lack of computer resources. I think the user interface keeps getting less polished - starting to look like some cheap product from the late 90's.  Tired of having to buy an upgrade of this product every few years."
1,"This is a very good program for improving your typing skills. You must stay motivated and practice often, but the program covers everything you need to dramatically improve your typing."
1,This is a great program that I have been using for years to plan my trips.  But it costs over $40 for the newest version.  Finding it for $20 on amamzon.com was a real bargain.
1,Simple to follow instructions make it easier to file tax returns. No math mistakes that you need to double check either.
0,"I don't like to spend a lot of time with instructions, so I like things people friendly. I found another web designer which made it quicker to get published. I'll try this one again."
1,"I have only ever used open source and free drawing programs before, since I am (unfortunately) not made of money, and I have to say that I was missing so much. Sketchbook Pro 6 lets me do things that I would previously have needed three different programs to accomplish, its tools are amazing, and it is absolutely made for tablet-use."
1,"I absolutely prefer Turbo Tax over H&R Block software. The software is much clearer to use and the prompts are very helpful. I was upset that Intuit decided to exclude schedules C and D this year and so had purchased H&R Block's software. H&R Block had more difficulty with my minister's housing allowance so I relented and purchased Turbo Tax 2014. It handled my housing allowance just fine as it has all the past years I've used it. I don't use schedules C or D so that feature removal didn't impact me. I definitely prefer and recommend Turbo Tax over H&R Block. I haven't used Taxcut so I can't speak to it.    An Addendum: I've been a minister for some 30 years and have always done my taxes and have never been audited, knock on wood. Because of this I have tried to stay on top of tax filing requirements for ministers. As any minister knows filing taxes as a minister is pretty complex and requires a multitude of forms and actions that many ministers cannot follow, that a non-minister cannot understand, and that many tax professionals have difficulty with, if one is to satisfy IRS requirements which is a moving target. I offered a synopsis of my experience with H&R Block's software versus Turbo Tax. I did not list every detail for brevity and because I'm not going to put all \\""my business on the street\\"". My opinion, subjective by definition, is that Turbo Tax does a better job of handling all the ins and outs of a minister's return and does it more smoothly with better explanations.    Take it for what it's worth. It's but one man's opinion."
1,Easy to set up and  some improvement from the previous version .i like the idea of renewing every year for $99
1,Works great
1,Great as always
1,Every year I use turbo tax which I have no problem with.
0,Haven't used this yet just wanted to let people know it was SLOW downloading and I Don't believe it was my PC or internet connection.  Make sure you have some time! Will see how it works.
1,Good
1,"Did the job,just fine!"
1,This was as Easy as 1-2-3!<br />Security Code to type in was Emailed to me within minutes of ordering  -  took about 10 minutes to download without a hitch!<br />DONE!
1,"Easy download, easy install, great price!"
0,"Nothing is a big improvement, not worth the money for the upgrade. I have not tried the App yet but I don't have a need for it now. Kind of resent being forced to pay for the newest version to sync with my accounts to have access to features I have no need for at this time.<br />On top of that it took me 2 hours to get it to install over the old version and import my accounts. I will be looking for a new software."
1,"The integration from Quicken was not clean. I just finally started over from scratch.  I like it so far. I loved Money,  finally switched to Quicken, HATED IT. Quicken software must be written by chimps. Hopefully this will be the last one i buy"
1,Especially good if you use Ancestry.com  I don't think it works with any other research programs.  One challenge I've had is when you make changes to this program and them work in Ancestry and 'sync' the two you lose the changes you've made in the program for what ever Ancestry says.
0,"it is sooooo slowwww it's unbelievable! I don't have patience!  I regret getting it :( I even thought my laptop had gotten a virus, that's how slow it is."
0,"Horrible. Would not function after last update. H&R Block, you're fired."
1,"I switched from Windows to Ubuntu and worked this into my workflow as well as GIMP. Walking away from Adobe Lightroom, this was very easy to do as they are very similar products. They each have really good things. For ASP, this version and older, Noise Ninja was included (you now have to purchase a separate license for NN).<br /><br />Mask edits is incredibly awesome once you get a hang of how it works and how to apply the masks to your processing.<br /><br />Everything else is about the same for file management, rating, flags and color correction.<br /><br />Export and Import is limited to file types. Supports a lot of camera's and CR2 (Canon RAW is what I use).<br /><br />Version 1.2.0.7 is what version I'm using."
1,"For me I always buy norton or mcafee...  This time around I went with Norton.  I mainly went with this since I liked the new feature in the software where I can next year just buy norton again from Amazon at a much cheaper price than in store or from the manufacture and not have to worry about uninstalling the old to put the new in, with norton now you just update the key and your goof for another year."
1,This was an upgrade for 2012 and it performs everything it used to and them some.  Looking forward to the book keeping process to becoming much easier with time.
1,Best price found<br /><br />Easy to download<br /><br />That is all I have to say but need to fill out the words
0,very bad friends<br />the download speed is very slow<br />I really do not recommend<br />It serves only to navigate slowly<br />they recommend other much better economic programs
0,Crashes all the time. Waste of time and effort.
1,refund was even more than expected. very easy to use.
1,"TurboTax is a very good product that will get the job done quickly and accurately.  A couple things to note: beware if you have to file more than one state ($40 extra) or you want to e-file your state ($20 extra).  All in all, the $40 extra to file one additional state is borderline worth the price.  The $20 extra to e-file your state is not worth it.  Just send the return to the state(s) by snail mail unless you are eager to get your refund faster.<br /><br />Another thing to note.  Through Turbo Tax, I computed the exact amount to put in my IRA to maximize my benefit.  You are able to open an IRA through the due date of the return (April 15, 2014 for this year),  After opening my IRA a week later for the amount specified by TurboTax, I tried to submit my return.  TurboTax recalculated my IRA deduction and rendered a portion non-deductible.  I lost about $40 on this transaction.  Next year I won't play it safe and wait to open my IRA before filing.  I'll file and then open the IRA!"
1,"I always used to purchase Turbo Tax, but H&R Block comes with 5 free e-files and a state download.  I do the whole family's taxes.  It came on time and as the seller said! Great deal."
0,I notice a pattern with these Quicken updates.  I have used Quicken for about 15 to 20 years.  The Quicken updates really don't change much like they once did.<br />I had been using Quicken 2008 for several years when the program started acting strangely.  When Quicken 2011 came out my downloaded transactions in Quicken 2008 would not<br />function properly.  Nothing I could do would correct the problem.  I checked out the forums and used their suggestions.  I used Quicken help and used their<br />suggestions.  I emailed Quicken and used their suggestions.  I could correct the problem for a couple of days and then right back to acting erratic.  Quicken 2008<br />would just not work for me anymore.  So I purchased Quicken 2011 and installed it.  Presto!  My file was converted and worked like a charm.  No problems.<br />I used Quicken 2011 until Quicken 2013 came out.  My Quicken 2011 started acting strangely.  My downloaded transaction in Quicken 2011 would not function properly.<br />Nothing I could do would correct the problem.  So I purchased Quicken 2013 and installed it.  Presto!  My file was converted and worked like a charm.<br /><br />Is it my imagination or is Intuit downloading a bomb into the older Quicken programs?  The updated Quicken programs certainly do not have enough features for me to<br />want to purchase a new version.  They don't even bother to make the pages more attractive.  So am I being forced to buy the new versions of Quicken?  Intuit does not<br />even offer a cheaper upgrade to their software as so many other software companies do.  You pay full price for a new Quicken that you do not want nor need.<br /><br />The loss of Microsoft money has really taken away Intuits competition.  I hope that one day some software company will offer a financial program with bill pay.  Then<br />I believe people will leave intuit in droves!
0,"This is only a product key to get updates and activation if you already have Office 2010 on your computer loaded but do not have or have lost your product key.

Nope, the download deleted my entire office suite and left me with no Microsoft Office applications at all!

1,"I'll have to admit, importing my data from Quickbooks Desktop wasn't as problem free as I thought it should be.  I had to input a lot of payroll data that should have been recorded already and my customers' info doesn't display correctly on my invoices.  Once I got use to it though, it is really easy to use and I really like the way I can connect my back account and auto-pay my taxes.  Overall I like Quickbooks Online a lot and will continue to use it."
0,"have realised today that I mistakenly purchased office365 which is for one year only, when I should have purchased office 2013.<br /><br />I had not realised what I was doing when I bought it online. My mistake as I hadn't realised office2013 existed as a separate product. Despite having purchased office365 and it working ok for a couple of weeks, a week ago it corrupted and I could not open any files. The quick repair nor the online repair would work so I took it into a PC repair today shop as I desperately needed to access my files.<br /><br />It was then that they told me I had an office product for one year only which I could use on 5 pcs etc. As I only have 1 lap top I only need a simple version of office for one machine.<br /><br />I would therefore appreciate a refund of the one year subscription £80 and instead pay the extra for the one off cost of office 2013 for £109.<br /><br />Please can you advise how I go about getting a refund and switching to office 2013 and paying the extra in the easiest way."
0,Doesn't work. Won't refund.
0,"This product is inferior to the Quicken2007 product I had before.  Which in turn was weaker than the previous Quicken version I used, which was weaker than the one before that.  I returned Quicken2011 20 minutes after downloading it.  Compliments to Amazon+Intuit for making the return and refund process easy.  -- The primary problem I had with the Q2011 was that in the accounts window, it was no longer possible to use keyboard accelerator to jump to the account of interest. I verified this with the Intuit support staff.  I've accumulated about 80 accounts over the years and really value this now-missing feature.  I was very frustrated that a valuable feature like this one (and many others over the years) have disappeared.   I decided to stop paying Intuit every three years for a product that is weaker than the previous."
1,"It fulfills all that I expect of a tax program, but what I most like is that It loads my previous year's return."
1,Snagit is user friendly and very useful.
0,"Do not buy this software unless you just need to file a return electronically.  You have to know what to fill in - it does nothing for you.  I wound up going back to TurboTax - even with their higher prices, I felt like I got a better deal since I know the answers were right!"
0,"... and then it stopped working. I thought maybe a re-install would fix the problem, but I cant re-install it from Amazon. And when I sign into Microsoft.com they say I don't have a program. I'm seriously considering writing off the 100 bucks and swearing off anything associated with Microsoft.<br />Trying one more time I sent the following to Amazon:<br />This product stopped working several days ago, not opening. I received an automated contact from Microsoft saying that there was a problem with the installation and that they would repair it online. After several failed attempts a final attempt resulted in an automated message from Microsoft saying that I needed Windows 7 or better to re-install this product, this despite the fact that I am running Windows 8. After this message I found that Outlook 2013 had been removed from my PC with no further explanation from Microsoft. Attempts to resolve this problem on line have resulted in Amazon passing the buck to Microsoft, and Microsoft taking me no further than an automated message saying that I don't have there product. I will settle for either a fix or a refund. Thank you."
0,"This version of Quicken overwrites any other copy of quicken it finds.  Kinda makes it difficult to keep an old copy for personal checking and this copy to manage a home business.  Wasted an hour online with Quicken support and their best suggestion was to install on a second computer.  Can't request a refund from Amazon so I'm off writing letters to Intuit requesting a refund.<br /><br />Very disappointed.  Wish I could give negative stars.<br /><br />Hope I'll see a refund someday, maybe."
1,don't like the amazon logo with download but it will suffice.
1,"Been using Quicken for long time. This one works pretty well too, only one major glitch that I have seen so far.<br />On my Dell laptop (2012 model, Windows 8), when it opens, it opens with the top and bottom of the program off screen. Take some work to get it so I can see the whole window. If I drag it to my second monitor (23\\""), and open it up full screen, only part of the program shows, strangest thing...<br />Best feature (and the reason I did this upgrade), is the mobile version on my Samsung Note II. I love the way I can shoot a picture of the receipt, add the info and it saves all of it to my PC (through the cloud). Makes it so much easier to attach a receipt to a transaction so I can find it later for taxes.<br />Now if they would just fix that open program problem..."
1,it works as a vpn should
1,"Whoa! Major difference between 2008 for windows and this new Mac 2015.  That said, the data transfer was so seamless and easy that I thought perhaps I did something wrong. Finding all the right buttons has been difficult but I'm getting used to it and best of all...no more PC!"
1,"Windows 8.1 not so much, but that horse has been well beaten.  I need the RDP client for remote access, and the $90 is about the same as the paid remote services, but they have to renew every year.  And, RDP still has the &#34;factory built in&#34; advantage in performance."
1,"I have used the Turbo Tax package before although I do sometimes do it myself (depending on how complicated the year was). Turbo Tax definitely saves you time both with gathering your info and with presenting the correct tax forms to use.  It also helps with suggestions on areas for deductions and does include updated info that relates to each year! Updates & changes to tax code can take time to review & that is if you get all of them.<br /><br />Used the e-file and had my tax refund back within two weeks.  And I didn't file until the 2nd to last day,  What more do you want..?"
1,Been using Quicken since the early to mid-90's and have always had satisfactory results.....very rarely have I had &#34;any&#34; issues with the program.
0,"This is probably the WORST version of QuickBooks I've ever used in my life and I've been using QuickBooks since the 90s.  The layout is atrocious, the stock reports are next to useless, and it crashes as if Intuit is a open-source startup!  I haven't experienced such poor quality from Intuit since they \\""upgraded\\"" Quicken 6 (which was the last great version of that program by the way).  If you have an older copy, stick with it.  This is not a great upgrade.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: It even gets worse! Not only does it behave like a version 1 program, it seems as if the developers have lived in a cave as UI design advanced through the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  And I don't mean fancy widgets.  When I can't do something as simple as favorite a report THAT I AM LOOKING AT, there's something terribly wrong.  Even from the Memorized Report List, I can't favorite a report.  What I have to do is drill down to the section the report resides and THEN click the heart to favorite it.  Why did they even bother?<br /><br />By the way this tedium is necessary because I can't simply create a generic Memorized Report that can be used GLOBALLY across companies!  Again, WHY?!?!  The concept of accounting is pretty simple: assets, liabilities, revenue, expense.  The memorized reports group according to those parameters but I can't create ONE memorized report that I can apply GLOBALLY.<br /><br />The lack of foresight put into this software is ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING for a company that has existed for MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS!  How they outsurvived Meca Software is beyond me!"
1,"I have been using this for 6 weeks now and I have been waiting for all of the problems others users have seen pop up.  So far so good.  No double entries coming in from the mobile app, no syncing problems.  My wife and I both have the apps on our phones and it keeps us on the same page.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I did have to pay the ransom to upgrade from 2010 because the online features will stop working after April 15th."
0,"Forced to buy because version I had &#34;expired&#34; according to Quicken. New version, I have had nothing but problems since download and very slow."
1,"I have successfully used this product for several years to protect all of my computer systems.  During this time I have had no problems with viruses, but several infected emails were identified and removed before I received or opened them."
1,"Excellent product, fast delivery."
0,"I just purchased this product to get a product code to renew my Norton 360.  The product key DOES NOT work to renew my Norton 360.  I was redirected to the Norton website, and am in the process of downloading new software and uninstalling Norton 360.  I bought this product because I thought I would be able to just input the new product key to renew (as currently stated in the description).  If I had known I would have to uninstall and reinstall, I probably would have gone with something cheaper."
1,No problems so far!  I'm happy with it.
1,"Solid software and easy setup, had it going in minutes and helped me organize my business plan from start to finish.  If you're serious about building a successful business you'll create a business plan, if you value your time, you'll go with this software.  The downloadable version made it a no-brainer for me and the tools it has provided has been truly invaluable."
0,"Dear Intuit,<br /><br />Every three years, you force me to upgrade my version of QuickBooks Pro. Because my accountant needs a windows format file (and you still haven't managed to get your mac and PC versions to work correctly together 10 years after the rest of the world did), I have to run this in a virtualized windows instance; everything is slow and clunkier than it would have been native on my desktop. I guess that's a mercy, since I need to restart my computer to install your application. You use the installation process to subject me to various attempts to upsell other services and force me to jump through multiple hoops, including registering for/looking up an account I never need - in another attempt to upsell more services I don't need.  After struggling with your account systems (you have a user ID for us that isn't the email address; how quaint!), I realize that I need to figure out what the security answer the guy who registered this 12 years ago used, that we haven't had to know ever since. Never mind; email addresses are free; I'll just use a different one; wonder what this will break?<br /><br />Hey, look! you're collecting a bunch of marketing info about me; wonder if you'll be selling this to Dun and Bradstreet and all the other scam artists trying to develop a system to charge for company info? I can't see how telling you this is doing me any good. More upsell, and I'm in!<br /><br />Wow, a new interface loaded with wizards and upsell spam. I paid for this software, stop trying to sell me more stuff and let me use it! Four levels of nag boxes trying to get me to click on them before I can use the actual tools! A UI that looks like a cross between a circa 2006 web application and Office from 2003/4. It's called anti-aliasing; you can smooth those edges right out! Why are the corners rounded on the outside, sharp on the inside? What happened to the accounts list and register; they were the only things that worked half-right anyway; oh, now I need to scroll down to get to it because you decided to share the sidebar with a bunch of upsell crap!<br /><br />Dear Intuit: if you're going to subject your customers to forced upgrades, the very least you can do is keep the experience from being so completely miserable. It makes them angry, and while we may be forced to use your software as a de-facto standard now, the kind of ill-will this inspires will eventually inspire people to find another way."
1,Very easy to download. And I can protect all my devices.  Love it.
0,"I purchased the CD disk<br /><br />Very disappointing to find on my first reconcile that the dates cut off at dec 2014, no new entry shown for any of my 2015 .  so I was ready to reload the 2012 version..<br /><br />But help was from a chat with a quicken staff, & a \\""fix\\"" was sent to upgrade my  version.<br />And it worked!<br /><br />I don't know why quicken would issue a new version with this error!<br /><br />Roger Tregear"
1,"Have been using for the last 6 years. Every year the new edition picks up where the previous one left off. The program knows if you have carry overs, knows your depreciable assets. I prepare 1 S corporation, 1 Trust return and 4 personal returns all for 1 purchase. This is a great value. I have never used Turbo Tax and have no incentive to switch!"
0,I could not download it on my computer and  I could not get ahold of anyone to fix the problem.  I wasted my money!
1,"Accurate,informative,gets you every penny of your money. Does not miss any deductions. I have loved it for 21 years🙌🙌."
0,This product opens in a DOS like window.<br />You are trying to read teeny weeny type.<br />I tried adjusting screen resolution and it adjusts<br />nothing in the typing software window.<br />This product is junk for the money.<br />Why does it not operate in the a windows environment?<br />Save your money do not buy this junk!
1,Best product for all bookkeeping have been a user for years
0,"Except for some minor design changes, it appears to be exactly the same as the 2013 product (which was about the same as the 2012 product).  I also found the mobile device app to be of minimal use...basically it does nothing with your investment information and I would guess is only useful if you actively budget your expenses in Quicken (I do not).<br /><br />I have used Quicken for years to track retirement investments.  It has served this purpose remarkably well; however, it seems that there is not much being done to advance the software beyond what one could find from any number of on-line services.  I remain an active Quicken user for the time being and hope that it might see a meaningful update in the near future."
1,"you ever wake up  look at the calendar and go Oh No.<br />I did.  Thanks to this software I learned a lot about one of the family household people's impact for collecting SS.<br />Great software easy to use steps.  went right through it and turned out I didn't owe, but in fact got returns on both state and federal tax.<br /><br />Will use this every year from now on."
1,I have used turbotax for many years and I am very happy with it.
1,I have used this products for several years including making a revision to previous tax years.  Would recommend this product for personal use.
0,"The auto update frequently gets stuck.  It won't update on its own like it should and then alerts me that I have issues that need to be fixed, forcing me to open the interface and click to &#34;fix all&#34;.  Annoying.  Also, the parental controls that come in the package will not work.  I have contacted tech support.  I have been waiting weeks for a response.  So, I give there tech support a failing grade."
0,Amazon does not permit file only downloads.  Only order if you want Amazon software on your machine.
0,This product could be just the right thing you need but the lack of multi-currency handling is something that this Mac version is missing and having it could make it a complete product<br /><br />Overall this product is great!
0,"I have used Office for years, but my last purchase will be my last purchase. I CANNOT afford ANOTHER monthly/yearly bill, and I refuse to sign up for anything that will charge me for the rest of my life. I will be purchasing an Apple this year. The computer may be more expensive, but in the long run I will save money on software and problems. Goodbye greedy Microsoft."
1,I have been using Turbo Tax for several years.  It's easy to use!
1,good
1,Love this program. I've used Quicken for years and you couldn't beat the price on Amazon.
1,I have used Quicken for years to keep our personal and farming operation books and love the product.  Recently my Quicken 2008 decided it did not want to open my files anymore so I downloaded Quicken 2012 from Amazon and hoped it would fix the issue.  Luckily it did! I am now back to keeping our our books on this product.  It opened my old files perfectly and I was so relieved!  Couldn't do our taxes without my Quicken!
1,"This is a well done, thoughtful program, providing pronunciation and commonly used vocabulary in small groups of related words. A little bit of a grammar supplement would be helpful regarding plurals, etc. This company provides several levels of instruction in other languages, but unfortunately only one level for Kannada. I have experienced several other programs and this is the best so far. I am not experienced at downloading items, so this could have been my fault, but downloading it was a real pain and I had to contact assistance."
0,"MUST READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!  Wish there was a negative star option. Mcafee slows my otherwise fast p.c. down,  and runs pointless scans that overlook most viruses. How do I know? Well I found the exact location of a few viruses and attempted to &#34;shred&#34; the files and it's content (for those of you who don't know, shred is a right click option mcafee gives you which executes the obvious). After recieving  the annoying &#34;can not perform task, you don't have permission. 'unknown user' has sole authority, blah blah blah&#34; & &#34;file can not be shred because it is open on another computer&#34; error messages, I attempted to &#34;scan&#34; the files (another mcafee option) so I could quarantine the virus, but mcafee did not detect anything. I come to find out mcafee ITSELF is a form of virus. Makes complete sense now. The only option is to quarantine threats after a weekly scan. SOUNDS effective, but the virus itself is still in its original location, just not active. And after removing a virus (annoying chrome extensions, 'weather app', etc...) it found it's way back only hours later. Turns out, when you look into your system files, to see what programs are scheduled to run and when, they reappeared and we're programmed to run &#34;infinitely&#34; after triggered by a certain action (like waking up your pc or restarting ur comp.) or 'true' condition (programmers understand this concept of a loop). Just a side note: the files I discovered with said viruses, completely 'vanished' the following day. After searching for the file, I finally found it.  but it was empty, the content was gone and moved.<br />FINALLY MY CONCLUSION:<br />DO NOT BUY ITS NOT WORTH IT! There is free software out there, ex. malwarebytes, that protects you better and use less memory.<br />Also noted: if you're using a Microsoft OS, use their security essentials and whatever else it comes with. And be sure to ALWAYS UPDATE your computer. It updates security breaches found and info on newviruses to help keep new ones out."
1,"It works.  It does everything that MS Office does, at a fraction of the price. The interface is their own, but the keyboard commands are exactly what I am used to.  In other words, there is a very shallow learning curve.  Well thought out & easy."
1,"I have been using turboTax for years, no other was to go as far as I am concerned. I did both of our business. Great product."
0,Can't login and it doesn't work I have been holding on line with Microsoft for over an hour.  Really sucks
1,"For several years I have had my taxes done by a CPA.  In 2011 the accountant disallowed expenses that turned out to be perfectly legal.  I wound up owing several thousand dollars that were unnecessary.  I thought what could be worse, if I turned to Turbo Tax, a product I had used when I was making far less.  The 2012 edition was terrific.  Easy instructions, really careful alerts to any significant concerns and the product helped me avoid any clumsy errors.  TurboTax developers provided clear and understandable instructions and explanations for recent tax law changes.  Review went extremely well and I had no problems with the return.  The newest versions appear to be so much better than several years past."
0,"I guess I will add to the one star plurality. I have used quicken from the very beginning and generally found it does what I need it to do. However, I have never been happy with the forced upgrade policy, especially when the new version is worse than the old. That is certainly the case this time. I don't like the new register view and can't figure out how to change it. There was a bug in the backup feature that took me hours of searching the online Q&A to solve. The whole \\""placeholder entries for missing transactions\\"" is a nightmare to handle. In short, the upgrade is a forced payment to continue to use the download transaction feature which, sadly, I feel I must have."
1,"This is the best antivirus program that I have ever used. I have used Norton, Norton 360, Kapersky, and Macphee."
0,"Cyberlink hasn't produced a solid video editing software variant in YEARS!!  The last stable version I used was Cyberlink Power Director 8 I think.<br /><br />I have an HP Pavilion Desktop computer with an AMD A10 Quad Core Processor, 10 GB of RAM, and 2 GB of Dedicated Video Memory, and this program STILL lags up and crashes on me.  Simple tasks involving dragging and trimming video in the timeline are very ill responsive and well,...the entire program lags up and freezes when performing even the most mundane tasks.<br /><br />Save your money, and find a better video editing software that actually RUNS SMOOTHLY."
1,Everything worked right and was a lot cheaper than Walmart
1,I have had some problems with it. Normally it works very well.
1,Cheaper and better than turbo tax what else needs to be said?
1,"Easy installation.  Basic is free, but you can add as much protection as necessary for fair price.  Automatic updates  Never had a problem for as long as I have had it."
0,"What a pile of junk.  The free version has zero benefits.  You must purchase the grime fighter to get any clean-up.  Only problem, they require a credit card with an automatic renewal!  Now I am trying to uninstall the software and the program will not let me!  Says I do not have permission.  No number available to contact for help either.  What a SCAM."
1,Just what you expect from TurboTax.
1,Probably best freeware antivirus program. Uses less resources than McAfee. Saved me from malware more times than i can remember.
0,It will not link with my bank  or loans.  Tells me wrong password.  I have the correct password entered.  Try again.  Same result.  Useless?  You got it.
0,would not load.
1,Great program. I have  been using Turbo tax for years
0,"I allready use norton I THOUGHT I COULD GET A PRICE BREAK BY ADDING PRO FOR 1 MORE YEAR-WRONG- THE 19.99 was a scamm, when i loaded morton pro i got a much higher bill, like almost triple.........<br />when i tryed to contact norton-which i did several times- i didnot receve any notice........so im out 19.99 plus 60.00 for a reload.<br />non today when i check amazon i see a free download....little late the horse left the barn......i got holding their feed bag!"
1,I upgraded from 2010 version and I find that 2012 runs faster than any recent version I have used. I don't like the budget features as well as 2010 but overall it is an excellent product..
1,"Yes and I like owning it, not leasing it like Office 360.<br />when the lease gets down to 20 yr the it will have more value then purchasing it (may be) 129.99 and I have my computers on average 3yrs = $3.61 month = $43.32 yr."

0,"God help anyone who has to reinstall.  Even after registering my product with Microsoft, getting another download is a disaster only Microsoft customer service and licensing could screw up so badly.  I have been through three MS employees who have requested my product key, verified it, then passed me along.  I'm heading to a  supervisor. This is a disaster only Microsoft could setup, which is no surprise.<br /><br />***********************************************************<br />Update.  The situation was finally resolved when I identified my account was registered under \\""another\\"" email address.  The amazing thing is, even if you have your product key, and your name, there is no connection between that and your software purchase.  The key just says \\""valid\\"" to Microsoft technicians-provides little solace when you need the software to use it.  They go through all these efforts to register a license to a person and then seem to lose all that information when it comes time to help the customer - really, MS? Your license number becomes \\""dumb\\"" as soon as you pay Microsoft and register.  Therefore, note, you must have two pieces of information to maintain your access to the software you own - your license number, and the email account you register with.<br /><br />Things can get really confusing with tech support, when they tell you - \\""you probably purchased a key which only allows you to install once\\"" come on, even if that sort of thing really existed (and only MS could conceive of that), they should be able to see what your key is registered for.  Nope.  No can do.  All that MS technology and their tech support can't even see what kind of purchase you made on it.  They even asked me every time - \\""OK, what product does this key correspond to, Office, Word, Excel or what\\""  They can't even tell you the product registered under a key.<br /><br />I don't think Amazon is at fault here. In fact, it was the only source of comfort I had being able to look up the key on Amazon and point to the purchase when some tech asked questions."

1,I loved using TurboTax! It was easy to follow the step-by-step directions. Being able to file electronically was so quick and efficient.
1,"Was easy to follow & kept all of year before information, so didn't have much to fill in. Would purchase it next year if price is right."
1,"My PC guy recommends Norton AntiVirus. OK. Last year, no problem. But somehow there was a problem with the 2012 download. amazon tech support was AMAZING. Told me how to restart the download. Then reminded me that there was a product key I needed to activate the product. Now, how the heck(!) was I supposed to know that the product key was contained in the order confirmation?? Did I say \\""heck\\""??"
1,"I had the same issues others had when I purchased my Maps on Sunday.  Doing the rounds of a few forums (and here) I soon found out I was not alone.  I sent an email to Garmin & Amazon.  Monday both replied and apologized, fixed the issue and all is well.  Took 2 hours to download and about 40 minutes to install.  All seems fine."
1,"Very useful for limited, automatic backup of files."
1,I bought this before I realized Outlook would do the same thing...lol But I used the old version and it worked great. This one seems excellent too.. Especially for the money.. Great for a guitar teacher to keep lessons in order.

1,"Complete, fast, easy to use"
1,The product is great! Very easy to use. Has the ability to record at 60fps which is very important if your a coach and use it to capture your own film easily. Only issue is if you go beyond 15 mins of 60 fps recording time. The program will dump the project and freeze up. Would be nice if you could easily compress the converted file after. When running full screen at 60 fps the files are huge (which makes sense). If you want a program that can easily record aprox. 15 mins this is the product for you! Thanks!
1,excelente !!!
1,This makes a nasty task at least tolerable.  Easy to operate program it walks you throught the entire process in a few hours regardless of the complexity of your return.
1,"Totally easy to use. Our taxes are fairly complex, TurboTax walked us right through it. Love it."
0,"very since i downloaded in on my computer, my computer has slowed down has been freezing. i had norton on my computer before i got this one off of amazon but it expired. since i put norton 360 on my computer it acts like its a virus on the computer since the first day i downloaded it. i sent a email for a refund but i never got a answers back."
0,"Another year another marginal upgrade with numerous bugs and errors. I have been using Quicken for over 20 years and previously spent many hours on the phone reporting bugs which were always promised to be fixed (by someone overseas) but never were. Amazingly I was alpha tester for the 2015 version and found it pretty stable at pre-release, but now once again the errors are mounting and unacceptable. Red flags show actions required when none appear on click through. My stock account has a securities balance error of 5% and a cash balance error of over 30%. 1019 placeholder entries that need to be &#34;resolved&#34;-seriously??- That's about 40 hours of work. The amazing thing is I wiped all my accounts and started fresh this year to try an avoid any errors carrying over from prior years. Admittedly I do more than an average amount of stock trading, but what is the value if the program can't get the basic math correct.Intuit needs to spend more time fixing bugs and less time adding worthless features."
0,"I was annoyed that the program wouldn't let me print a copy of my return while I was working on it, but when I got ready to e-file, it said I had to update it first, and then it wouldn't let me do it."
1,"I decided to buy this version because my new Asus had its own email program (what I thought would be like Outlook). I live by my emails and need complete organization. The email program Asus comes with is basically just a dumping ground where you download all of your emails from all of your accounts--you can't create new folders. Love all the elements of this software, but really wish I'd paid the extra money for the one with Outlook."
1,"I love how accessible Adobe has made this product with the new subscription model. They used to charge $700 for this product, which I could never afford, but now it's only 10 bucks a month!!! I'm finally able to stop using the cheap photo products and use the real deal."
0,still have yet to get in touch with someone to help me figure out why I bought this product and could not down load it.  Microsoft has made an Apple customer out of me.
0,I liked turbo tax for the year 2013 mulch better.  And I didn't like it that I could not print it out before mailing it in.
1,ALWAYS COMPLETE AND EASY TO USE.
0,"Well well WELL!!! It takes 30 minutes for Amazon to verify my order before it's available for download.  Once it shows up in my download folder, it takes another 40 minutes on a 24 mbps speed (normally about a minute or two for a file this size) to download.  Once downloaded and I click &#34;install&#34; I'm prompted to either select &#34;trial&#34; or &#34;enter product key&#34; which I select and am then taken to another page,  Adobe no longer allows you to copy and paste your key in so I input each little box one at a time (not that big of a deal but overboard none the less).<br /><br />Once the key is entered, I click next and then it begins to download from Adobe yet again, for another 5 minutes.  Once I get that file, I click install which takes another 10 minutes on a quad core computer with 16 gbs of ram (seriously).<br /><br />I get it, I really do but if you'd stop screwing little old ladies by installing crapware like McAfee on their computers with each update of Flash or Reader, I might be a little more sympathetic.  Perhaps I should have considered the cracked version that comes up in the first page of Google results.  Hell, I'm fairly certain Pirate Bay has a plethora of them.<br /><br />Nope, I continue to be loyal to this billion dollar company since this is at least my 5th edition I've purchased over the years.<br /><br />Well done Adobe!"
1,"Best price and easy download.  If you have not tried Quicken, I recommend it.  This tool allows easy one screen view of all credit cards, investments and savings."
1,Now the documents attached to transactions are locally stored and can be attached by browsing to a file OR direct from scanner. This is a game changer!
0,"Was not useable, I guess program works ok but does not help. If I had to do again I would not have purchased."
0,I don't know what this is.  I thought it was renewing what I had already but it didn't replace it.  As a matter of fact I do not know what this is doing for my computers. I installed it but who knows.  Maybe it is just because I don't understand.
1,"I was a Quicken user for many years, but got sick of their ploy every couple of years to cut off support and your ability to download if you didn't buy a pricey upgrade.  Then I went to Mint.com. but after numerous problems with certain banks downloading, then not, and discovering that there is no way to import a csv file into Mint.com, I had to give up on them.  I did a lot of research on the various financial management software products available and settled on Moneydance.com.  That was in 2011 and I have been a happy camper ever since.  Love Moneydance.com. It is easier to use than Quicken and quite powerful without being complicated. And their tech support is great.  Yes you have to &#34;contact&#34; them thru their website and the support is via email, but I always have an answer back within 12 hours at the most and often sooner.  Any problem I have ever had, which is only a few, they have resolved.  That is a lot more than I can say for Mint.com and Quicken.  This is great software with great support!"
1,"My experience is that Avast provides more than adequate protection (from viruses & malware) for e-mailing & internet surfing than Norton's or McAfee's, both of which I've used in the past. Avast is easy to temporarily disable, which was not the case with Norton's or McAfee's when I used them several years ago. Norton's was more of a resource hog than McAfee's or Avast & slowed my system down considerably. the bottom line is that I've been happier with this free version of Avast than I had been with pay versions of other anti-virus programs."
1,"So far my computer is intact, thanks to Avast. It's great anti-virus protection."
1,"This installs easily and has a backup service. The software covers ten devices.<br /><br />I get annoyed that this is really a one year subscription, but it works well, and it also is the best choice antivirus  required to interface with my work computer, from a short list.<br /><br />The software will cover smartphones and tablets. Installation is easier now that there is an email-directed installation protocol. I installed this on my smartphone in minutes. I sent my email address FROM my phone TO the Norton site (there is a place under your account that says \\""add a device\\"") and I had it up and running in no time.<br /><br />This software is not 100% proof against all malware--last year, I did get an infection from a very clever piece of malware that used a trick to get installed and the previous edition of the software did not recognize it as malware. I do not know if this update has improved its ability to detect everything--it's rated as very good for catching malware."
1,"This is my second year using Turbo-Tax to help me do my taxes. Even after doing my taxes on my own for quite a few years, I can't imagine doing them without the help of Turbo-tax. After retiring, I started a consulting business, and there are just too many forms for me to consider doing them all myself. And then, there is the reading of all those instructions to consider. With Turbo-tax, I leave the instructions to them. If I have a question, the convenient pop-up windows provide the answer. Best of all, I see that I am getting all the deductions possible, and my return is as large as it can be. I used the federal e-file for the first time this year. Convenient and fast. Thanks, Turbo-tax!"
0,Just cancelled my subscription with a sigh of great relief. Don't even care if I can't get my files because I don't want to spend another 2 hours on the phone &#34;solving&#34; my login issue. I've run out of gas on this one! Last man switch the lights off pls.
1,"I usually don't write reviews but there are many negative comments regarding Quicken and it may be helpful to share my experience.<br /><br />I have used personal financial software for 26 years, starting with Managing Your Money and moving to Quicken in 1996.  In 2012 I got fed up with Quicken and switched to Mint.  I used Mint for 2 years mainly because it sometimes connected to my accounts.  In 2014, I obtained a credit card that Mint would not support and was pretty much fed up with not being able to balance my Accounts with mint and periodic connectivity issues.<br /><br />Two weeks ago I purchased Quicken 2014 Premier.  I found it easy to use and it connects to all my accounts with the exception of the one credit card and Kohl's.  To update this credit card, I log in weekly to the cc site, download the transactions.  The transactions are then automatically imported to Quicken with no duplicate transaction issues.<br /><br />I am still trying to get the Kohl's credit card to work.  However, this card is rarely used.  Net, it works and works well.  The issue with the one credit card is due to the bank not wanting Quicken to access it easily."
1,"Got fed up with the garbage movie maker program my computer came with, and snagged this program during a Sony software sale. I use Sony Acid to make and mix music, and the interface is very similar to that. This is so much easier to use than that pitiful movie maker program! Only issue I ran into is when mixing several video clips into a video, I get hiccups in the sound. I found the best way to get around this was to mix with the audio track first, then scrub out the audio, save that, then reimport it and add the audio track later. Sometimes you might have some issues where it doesn't look as nice uploaded to YouTube, but that's a YouTube problem.  It's really not that hard to operate, and you can constantly watch te progress as you go. I highly recommend if you ever want to do video editing!"
0,"The software is bloated and takes forever to load, even on my modern equipment. You have to have a 23&#34; or larger monitor to even see the whole thing as Intuit must believe no one uses laptops. -- even my 17&#34; screen is insufficient and you cannot resize the window.  Intuit has provided an update that allows you to color code accounts again. -- they must have fired their new age designers that said black is the new green blue and red. His t a bad experience, but once I wrangled it, it now works fine.  Better get a new a processor as you can find because its resource requirement is enormous."
1,"Easy digital download, multiple PC and effective suite. Highly recomend as a paid option for back up, antivirus, clean up and hard drive maintence."
0,Why on earth would someone be selling a 3 year old tax program?  Well it is free.
1,I've been running trend micro since 2008 haven't had any problems with my computers. Just a note before you download the program make sure to erase your old internet security progam even if its trend micro that way you won't have any problems. This was the first time i've downloaded it off the internet always got the disk before. If they keep offering it this way that's how im going to get it.
0,It saves my photos...over and over and over again.  It uses a lot of energy on my phone.
1,"This is the 3rd. year I have purcheased and downloaded Norton 360 from Amazon. I am only a &#34;basics&#34; computer dummy. I've never had a bit of trouble dowwnloading this product. It's beyond me why anyone would go to a store, pay a high price and then install it. This couldn't be easier, faster and more affordable."
1,"Not much to say about Adobe.  They hold the world hostage with their PDF file type, so if you want to be able to do anything of value with a PDF, you have to buy their insanely expensive software.  Oh well, it's the way it is and Adobe PRof. XI works exactly as it is meant to... great!<br />I don't mind paying for something that works (which is why I buy Mac computers).  If you need to be able to edit and create PDF's, this is the way to go."
1,Great software at good price
1,I was nervous to purchase Microsoft Office to use with my Mac but the installation was easy and fast. And it is easy to use if you transition from a PC to a Mac!
1,"I love the comfort of knowing I have entered all the needed information, and that TurboTax did all the calculations correctly."
1,"I've been using this product since 2004 and Norton Anti-Virus since the late 1990's.  I have yet to be shut down or lose data using this product.  I have TWC Road Runner and TWC offers it's own watered down version of the competition.  I used it for a year... It was free! You get what you pay for!  If it weren't for the fact I keep important data (pictures, documents, etc...) on CD/DVD I would have been in some serious trouble.  Once I started using Symantec's Norton products I've not had a problem in 15 years!"
0,"Software wasn't easy to use at all.  Very confusing, and hard to understand how to purchase more programs in the right profile.  Very poorly organized."
1,Very user friendly.  I've been using TurboTax for several years.
0,didn't find the virus.  went with vipre
1,I found QB to be essential in organizing my accounting for my psychotherapy practice.  It strikes the right balance of being able to handle the complexity of my business with easy enough/intuitive enough interface and functions.
0,"Prior to renewing a protective/security/anti-viral program, I had researched.  Due to the high ratings, I purchased Kaspersky Pure.  I will not be renewing.  When I had an issue in the past, I had to spend a significant amount of time researching their site/forums for resolution.  When I could not find a solution, I wrote to them.  The reply was totally useless and didn't even apply to my question/issue.  When I recently had a SIMPLE question, I was happy to see their new chat option.  The person on their end must have been handling several calls at once.  When I commented on the length of turn-around time on her end and mentioned not being very happy with their feedback with previous issue, I got a snooty reply and SHE ended the chat.  Their product may be good, but their customer service and tech support are abysmal."
0,"if you've used Quicken Rental Property Manager from earlier years, you'll find this program too similar to be worth the pricetag. Yes, it's a good program. But the company is sitting on it's laurals and has not addressed bugs in the program and has even brought these pre-exsisting bugs into newer versions of the program. (Not the sign of a good company.)<br /><br />If you're new to quicken, by all means, go ahead and try it out. Its a great program overall, but if you're looking to upgrade, you're just better off staying with the version you have as the changes they made are minor at best."
1,Was satisfactory and met all expectations.  Completed my taxes fine.  Would download it again instead of having to make a trip to Best Buy.
0,"I'd actually give it 1.5 stars but since I'm sitting here with it spinning trying to reset my online account I'll round down.  I cannot get past the inability to download my main checking account transactions; this isn't a new feature with some bugs to work out, it's something that's been around for a while.  Their resolution to reset the account results in a hung program.  I had issues with previous versions and it felt like it was getting worse with each release; I should've trusted my intuition (no pun intended) rather than giving them another chance."
1,Great product.  I tried to download other software products to use with MS products but this is way worth it.. highly recommend
1,It worked great! Thank you.
0,i do not like the menus at all.... i found a way to download IDVD onto my new mac book!
1,I've used it for decades. Works fine for ordinary family and small business taxes.
0,"Yeah, it sort of works, unless you have some obscure form and no idea on dealing with taxes.<br /><br />For someone familiar with taxes I could imagine this is quite the treat.<br /><br />For myself, not so much.<br /><br />In particular, S corporation, the boy (my son), had shares of the companies stock, and there was really no way to &#34;tell&#34; the software this, and it was only dumb blind luck that I found the set of forms that related to it.<br /><br />took two - three attempts to get through this process and come to find out, you almost literally had to leave everything blank and at the very tail end of it did the  form I needed appear.<br /><br />Side effect of all this monkeying around was that &#34;an error has been detected&#34; and the thing decided I had a company car.<br /><br />Now that wouldn't have been nearly so bad if it had actually taken me back to a dialogue to set things straight.  Or again if I were an expert on these matters.<br /><br />Instead it plunks me down on a form and won't let me get off of it until I supply bogus information on a &#34;company car&#34;<br /><br />Wonder how the IRS will deal with a Rolls Can'ardly (Rolls downhill and can hardly make it back up) with zero company miles?<br /><br />The &#34;surprise&#34; at the cost of filing state taxes really wasn't appreciated, and on state I wound up paying TurboTax one more dollar than my total refund.  (20.00 fee for filing in Indiana)<br /><br />Wouldn't say don't get it, it did actually do the job.<br /><br />Would suggest saving often, at key points (so you can quit and restart), particularly if you have anything that's off the main path taxwise."
1,I have had norton for 10 years and it has always worked for me. I always buy a new copy when it runs out because I run 2 computers and it is cheaper then renewal costs
1,just nice and easy
0,The designing and build features are great. The full and section camera views break up if your mouse crosses them. When trying to add things from the library in vector or render view it doesn't work so basically you are stuck adding or changing in design view.
0,Bought deluxe as it is the product I have been buying for the last several years - I didn't read the package prior to purchasing-my error!  The deluxe no longer allows you to process 1099B transactions - to do this you must upgrade to the next level-another $25 bucks!  Turbo tax has become like so many other entities today -product appears the same as the past - name is the same - price is the same but the product is lacking substance - some what like the cereal and cracker producers are doing - you think you are getting the same - but product in the box is much less than in the past.  I felt deceived
1,"A lot of improvements over Office 2010, and you can a actually split Excel into two different screens...! Hurray!<br /><br />Just a shame that Microsoft fragments their products into a confusing bunch of different versions (Professional, Pro Plus)...!<br /><br />--Added later--<br /><br />I've noticed a lot of the critical reviews on Office 2013 are based on the background color options in Office and the excessive white shade etc.<br /><br />Although I'm not disputing that, I've found that you can get used to the changes pretty fast and enjoy the improved functionalities of Office 2013.<br /><br />What has not been mentioned here, is the fact that 'PowerPivot' is no longer free in Excel 2013 (as opposed to Excel 2010).<br /><br />So in my case, my upgraded Excel files no longer supported the 'PowerPivot' files and even though I purchased Office Professional 2013, I'm no longer entitled to PowerPivot.<br /><br />As Microsoft states on its website \\""The PowerPivot add-in for Excel 2013 is only available with Office Professional Plus 2013.\\""<br /><br />I found that to be very annoying, it's time for Microsoft to deliver more bang for the buck...!"
0,"I've used TurboTax for the past 4 years, and each time they keep slightly raising their prices but each time I come back because of the benefit of the preloaded information from the previous year's return. This year, the price gouging is WAY out of hand, and you have to use the most expensive version just to have access to all of the forms. My return ended up costing me almost $130 to file! This is definitely the last year I will be using TurboTax. They are like the college tuition of tax prep software, increasing costs without adding any value!"
0,No longer can use Schedule C or Schedule SE even though Intuit's website says differently. I am so confused and unsure that I'm switching to HR Block after being a loyal Turbotax customer for decades. Disappointed.
1,Everything I expected.  Norton was recommended to by by an expert.  Im so glad I purchased Norton to protect my valuable electronicd.
1,Avast's free antivirus is the best and most unobtrusive security system that I have ever had on my home computer.  I always feel confident that it is doing its job safeguarding me from dangerous and unwanted intrusions.
0,If you traded any stocks in 2014 you are pretty much forced to either upgrade to Turbo Tax Premium ($80 -$90) or better yet find a less expensive alternative from another company!<br /><br />I was fortunate to read the horrible reviews on Amazon before I purchased the software.  Thanks to all for their spot-on reviews!<br /><br />I went to Intuits website and every indications is that Turbo Tax 2014 will not automatically generate a Schedule D (Stock trading).  It appears to allow for manual creation of a Schedule D form but you cannot eFile the manually generated form?<br /><br />The only question I still have is why they call it deluxe.  Stock trading is not supported in Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014?  Wouldn't that be Turbo Tax lite?  or Turbo Tax 1040EZ? or Turbo tax for the part-time high school student living at home with Mommy?<br /><br />I'm searching around for a comparable and reasonably priced alternative.<br /><br />It's disheartening but I believe this concludes my 15 year loyal customer relationship with Intuit (Turbo Tax)<br /><br />I am thankful that I did hear about the shortcomings of TT 2014 before I bought it.  It's nice when you can  dodge a bullet :)
0,"DON'T BUY THIS JUNK!!!!!!!!!<br />It does NOT IMPORT ALL YOUR DESKTOP DATA, BUT JUST ARBITRARY PERIOD WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY CHOOSE.<br />My main checking account has over 10 years' history, and it imported just 55 transactions. Not even all 2015 transactions.<br />I have NO IDEA how to import (download) credit card transactions from the bank's website.  QB arbitrarily imports just the most recent transactions.<br />HELP section junks, too.<br /><br />I am sick of software vendors making unnecessary changes calling them &#34;upgrade,&#34; in order to steal customer's money every 3 years.  Not much value added to the customers, but unnecessarily &#34;adjustments&#34; eating up all my relax time by paying hundreds of more dollars.  Just say straightforwardly &#34;We want your money every 3 years,&#34; and make no changes!"
0,"TurboTax performed up to spec, but it took a ridiculous amount of time to learn it's quirks and to understand what I was filling out."
0,"It's boring and a waste of money. Yes it has its fun moments, but overall I feel robbed.  All the cool items need to be bought separate for $20 or more.  I wish i could return this and get my money back."
1,"I was using manual spreadsheets to manage my accounts but I got tired of logging into all my banks, credit cards, investment accts etc. to copy/paste totals without categories.<br /><br />So I bought You Need a Budget 4 (YNAB4) from Steam for $10 but I guess that you get what you pay for. It is a glorified s/s without any autopull capability. Still, not a big issue since I can download statements and import into it. But it didn't categorize and I was left with having to assign categories to about 1200 entries which I didn't want to do.<br /><br />So I bought Quicken H&B 2014 based on my last usage of Quicken back in 2003 for a tax return. I recall getting a headache then with it and since then I've been going to an accountant. Still, I needed something and inspite of the lower reviews I bought Quicken and I must say it is a lot better than I imagined.<br /><br />In about 5 mins, I had setup all my accounts (at first I wasn't sure it was safe but my bank and investment and credit card companies had a section for how to auto-import data to Quicken so if it is safe for the banks to recommend it, I think I was fine with it).<br />Quicken autopulled all the data from all the places, sorted it all out in 5 seconds (some categories had to be entered manually and some had to be corrected but I am talking about 10 out of 1200 so not a big deal).<br /><br />It created reports/budgets etc. and I am happy with the output.<br /><br />There are a few bugs though -<br /><br />- for mortgage, the What if I pay extra is broken for the monthly. Inspite of saying Ie will pay extra $100/month the graph doesn't change and shows same curve as without paying extra. In reality it should drop by a few years.<br /> (EDIT: This bug is fixed as of Release 3. Yay! I like this software, does a good job)<br /><br />- sometimes credit card imports fail due to added security at credit card financial institution. The error is vague and so is the recommended fix. I ended up deactivating the online autoimport part of acct and redoing at which point it prompted me for the extra security (zip code, phone num etc.) and it all worked well after that. At least good part is it linked it back to original acct instead of creating a new one and creating a mess<br /><br />- The initial graph created for your mortgage is not accurate. Say if you started your mortgage in 2000 and are in year 13, the graph is a straight line till 2013 and then curves off. This is totally wrong. But at least rest of it is correct from present date<br /><br />- Account transfers are missing<br /><br />- Bill pay reminders don't work for credit card accounts strangely. Maybe I didn't set it up properly but I get alerts for mortgage reminders but not credit cards<br /><br />Other thoughts -<br />- the business part is not fully tested so not sure about that yet.<br />- statement reconciles etc. work well<br />- the android companion works well but you MUST create some quicken online ID, link it and upload your data there. I don't really need it and I'm not comfortable storing my data at Quicken. At least it deletes the link if you don't link to the cloud acct<br />- there is a password protect feature for using the software, storing your passwords and creating your backup files.<br />- gives the option to store your data file on some other storage medium (NAS in my case) which is good<br />- I like the automatically update all accts or some accts feature. This is so useful.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very useful and polished piece of software compared to the almost non-existent alternatives. There are issues with it and many features that I have not yet tested fully yet (business features, tax features) because I have an accountant as well but I'm hoping it does the job there.<br /><br />Final rating : 4/5 stars. I would recommend this software for managing all your personal finances. It does a fairly good job with that."
1,THE BEST!  AND IT'S FREE!!
1,"I have been using Norton/Symantec products since the late 80's and all their DOS utilities (Norton Commander, Norton Utilities for DOS) and I am glad to report that after a few bad years recently with bloated software and issues with different versions of their different products conflicting and slowing down or crashing systems...that this 2010 version of NIS is outstanding.  Very low system resource usage and it runs smoothly...wouldn't even know you had it installed.  That's what good security software should do....run silently in the background and protect your system without slowing you down.  Flawless operation now for several months.  Works with XP/Vista/7.  Try to get it when there are rebates."
0,"Buyers should be aware that Deluxe also no longer handles all Form K-1s in its interview section.  The program states that upgrade to Premier is required.  (There was no mention of any \\""forms only\\"" option.)  I have no need of any sophisticated securities purchase and sale support or support for complex business accounting, but will apparently have to upgrade solely to get accurate input off of this one key tax form.  UPDATE:  I find TurboTax's response -- which is essentially that they have retained, but buried in the Forms mode, functionality for Form K-1 -- to be totally unpersuasive.  If you're going to not support Form K-1 data for product symmetry reasons, then don't support it.  If you are going to support Form K-1 data, then support it.  You don't choose to eliminate maybe at most ten screens, but console customers by telling them if they are tax-savvy enough, they can still find a work-around by going to forms mode.  (And I again reiterate, THE PROGRAM ITSELF DOES NOT TELL YOU THIS.  When you try to enter a K-1 in the interview process (for which there seems to be an opportunity if you import last year's data), IT TELLS YOU ONLY THAT YOU MUST UPGRADE AND SPEND $30 MORE.  No mention of the supposed forms-only workaround.)  I requested a refund on 12/3 pursuant to Intuit's satisfaction guarantee.  (Amazon directed me to this as the method for return; Amazon will not allow return of a downloaded product even if the description was misleading -- which also is a problem and a caution for any future purchases.)  Still have not heard anything from Intuit about getting me my money back."
1,"Found it most easy to used.  The step-by-step approach is best for the majority of people, especially those who are not computer-friendly."
1,I love this product; I purchase every year. I purchased for the rental property features. It makes preparing and filing tax returns so simple.
1,"Worked well for my purposes.  Easy to work through.  Even though this software includes state, it does not include e-file for state which is expensive."
1,"I purchase Office for Mac so that, in my consulting business, I could create and share documents with my clients.  It works very well and allows me to save documents in older versions for my clients that have not upgraded to the latest and greatest.  The only problem that I have had is that the program occasionally stops responding and I have to shut it down and restart it.  This is the only program on my Mac that I have had this problem with.  Of course, when I lived in the Windows world I was use to these types of problems, so I attribute it to Microsoft.  Other then that, the product is great and does what I need it to do."
0,"When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.<br /><br />[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]<br /><br />For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You \\""have\\"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.<br /><br />* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.<br /><br />* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a \\""reminder\\"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be<br />paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.<br /><br />*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.<br /><br />* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.<br /><br />* You can't turn off the \\""free update/revision\\"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.<br /><br />* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.<br /><br />* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.<br /><br />* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.<br /><br />* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.<br /><br />Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.<br /><br />If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.<br /><br />[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.<br /><br />[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating \\""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ...\\"" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.<br /><br />[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.<br /><br />[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message \\""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment.\\"" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the \\""Ignore\\"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.<br /><br />[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for \\""how many times\\"" from \\""unlimited\\"" to \\""1.\\"" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.<br /><br />[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.<br /><br />[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.<br /><br />[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further.I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]<br /><br />[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.<br /><br />[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.<br /><br />[Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.<br /><br />[Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.<br /><br />[Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's \\""one-step update\\"" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?\\"" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'<br /><br />[Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.<br /><br />OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says \\""cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled.\\"" Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.<br /><br />Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has \\""imploded\\"" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.<br /><br />I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been \\""used\\"" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.<br /><br />Oh, and down in my tab titled \\""Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due\\"" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it wasalready paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are \\""enter\\"" \\""edit\\"" or \\""skip\\"" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter \\""skip.\\"" Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.<br /><br />I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's \\""sunset policy.\\"" Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man\\"" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!<br /><br />[UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.<br /><br />Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:<br /><br />* Export the data from Quicken using the \\""all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.<br /><br />* When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the \\""Import account info only\\"" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the \\""original transfer balance in\\"" for one account.<br /><br />After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.<br /><br />Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.<br /><br />The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbersin the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.<br /><br />I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet.

0,"I made the switch from Turbo Tax.  I don't like companies ripping off customers and playing it down.  So even though the changes wouldn't have affected me, I decided to switch.  I personally liked Turbo Tax set up better.  We live in Wyoming and Turbo Tax recognized that and asked us for information specific to our state.  For instance our car registration taxes.  H & R didn't.  Also, we refinanced and I had a hard time finding where to put in the information for two different bank interest forms."

0,"I completely agree with Scott. I purchased the Portrait+ 3.0 Photoshop Plugin software directly from this company and installed it my Win 7 computer. I tried to open perfect portrait photo within this plug-in and find out the face couldn't detected. So, I  tried to contact the technical support and find out there is a ridiculous tech support policy - 2-3 business days response time especially for the company who claim their self as a Global Leader In Imaging Technology . I would like to be fair. On my other computer I have Portrait+ version 2 and it's working acceptably well. The company management and marketing team need to understand any product only as good as the support behind it.  So, back to my issue, October 14th I sent the request for support and finally on October 20th I received an answer from the tech support rep. Nancy explaining to me that I don't have stable Internet connection this is why my software doesn't work correctly. I consider myself advanced computer user with more than 20 years of experience in installations, setup, troubleshooting etc. and I can say for sure I have very stable 25 Mbps Down and 10 Mbps Up Internet connection. First of all sorry, I can't accept this explanation as a logical, second - what I have to do for locations where I can't establish an Internet connection???. So, I restore my computer from the image I created before I install ArcSoft software to make sure I have clean computer without any ArcSoft traces. I install the software one more time. Unfortunately I get the same result. &#34;Face Can't be detected!&#34;. l sent the new question to ArcSoft with my direct phone number as well (just in case if they so kind to return the call) and I guess I will have to wait now for another who knows how long. In my opinion it is very unfair to the customers to not be able to call or at least live chat to the technical support team as need it. Meanwhile I have non working software I paid for because it doesn't work the way it promised and company seems like not belong of the 21st Century standards! This is exactly why I agree with Scott's statement to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
1,"I had Norton before and this is just a re-up. If I didn't care for it, I wouldn't be using it."
1,"I am about a month in with Windows 8.1 as of this writing. Before buying this I tried to install my PSP X3 which was supposed to be compatible but I couldn't get it to run. So, I bought this. here's a few random bits on my experience, some advice, and hopefully some things that will help some of you beyond just this software.<br /><br />My PC is powered by an Intel Core i7 980x processor @ 2.33 GHz with 24 GB of RAM and a very good video card and a monster 1500 watt power supply. I have a cable model. People often blame software, especially graphic software for problems that are more related to running modern software on an older and less adept PC. Imaging is a resource hog. Think of RAM as a workbench- the more room you have on the bench the easier it is to do big jobs. The less room you have, the more effort you have to put into making room and if you have a lot of stuff running in the background- all those icons by the clock are running in the background and more that doesn't show an icon. All that takes away from RAM. If you have a less than stellar processor, it has to keep all that stuff running and handle what you are doing with you imaging work, too.<br /><br />Something I found to be true with Windows 7 about half the time and I'm finding true with Windows 8.1 about 95% of the time is you really have to use the &#34;Run as Administrator&#34; command for installing software and launching it, at least for the first time. You can't do that from the bar at the bottom that gives you the save and run buttons. You can't do that from the &#34;View Downloads&#34; either. You have to locate the actual folder your downloads go into. From there you have to find the program, right mouse click it, and select &#34;Run as Administrator&#34; from there. I have seen programs that wouldn't install at all unless that was done and others that didn't work right after they did install unless I found the file and did the Administrator thing. I can't explain it easily; I just knowit works and Windows 8.1 seems to demand it more than Windows 7 did.<br /><br />It's the same with launching a program- right click the icon and select &#34;Run as Administrator&#34; and 'yes' whatever the UAC (User Account Control) pops out.<br /><br />To date, every program, except PSP X3, that has given me trouble with Windows 8.1 was resolved by the Administrator command.<br /><br />Here's my experience with this- the downloader took seconds to download, install and run. The program downloading and installing took mere minutes. When I launch it, it is open and ready to work with in under 5 seconds. Files load into the work area in a blink and my image files are on a secondary drive 1.5 TB in size while PSP X7 resides on my primary drive, a 256 GB SSD (solid state drive).<br /><br />I can't comment on the mechanics of the image manipulation because I obviously don't use everything but what I do use works very well. As to what is no different between this and previous versions, I can't say much there either because in truth I don't care. Sometimes the biggest improvements come from the smallest tweaks. If something is good to begin with, why does overhauling it make it better? Change for change's sake? Not in my world. It works for me as I want, it's fairly easy and straight forward to use and for what it does, I can't beat the price.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I copied the down loaded program file to a CD with all the emails, access and activation codes, etc. so it's all there should I need to install it again. To quote my single digit years of my comic book hero, Sgt. Rock: &#34;'Nuff said!&#34;"
1,"It's free and it worked.  HOWEVER, when I downloaded the Kansas State module ($14.99) it somehow mysteriously added $89,000 of income to the state return, which I caught immediately and deleted.  Not sure how it happened because it draws its info from the federal return.  Anyway, we were able to do both a federal and state return, file them electronically all is good now :)"

You will, however, have to be a bit patient in that it can get long on the install cycle.  Ignore the wait, it's fine.<br />The existing documents were intact as expected.<br /><br />I went over and installed this on a second machine with Windows 7 on a Dell laptop.  That machine had Office 2007 and 365 installed with no issues.<br />This has been a great product over the cycle of an initial purchase and subscription upgrade."

1,"I downloaded the Amazon software installer, downloaded TT home and business, installed it, updated the TT software, started a new return and imported last year's data in approximately 20 minutes with no problems whatsoever.

1,I bought Smarty in Santa's Village for my 2 1/2 year old grand niece because she's so curious about the computer. She's used to her mom's touch screen phone and Ipad so it took some work to get her used to using the mouse but she figured it out by about the 3rd time we played with the game. Now she moves the mouse with ease. The graphics and sound are simple but clear enough for a 2 year old to understand. So far she prefers the barn animals but I think that's just probably her favorite du jour. I'm on a tight budget so I'm glad I found a simple game for her age and abilities that I could afford and that she finds entertaining for 5 - 10 minutes at a time.

The value the program brings to me personally just can't be beat for that price. The budget feature has greatly improved and was a wow effect for me, which does not happen very often. I do not use the mobile feature and I am very happy with the software."
0,The state didn't download...and that's what I needed. Boo!
1,avast lets you set how many reminders you want and then it's really simple and easy to keep up to date with updates.
0,"Did not like it. Stopped and purchased Turbo Tax, much better"
1,"I bought this because of the cost compared to Microsoft's Wordperfect software.  Downloading was a little dicey, but that isn't the fault of the software, I am \\""computer challenged\\"".  I would recommend it to a friend or anyone.  For the price, you can't beat the deal!"
0,The software works well BUT is much toooooo pricey.
1,Did exactly what it was supposed to do. An excellent replacement for the Turbo Tax I had used up until this point. I will stay with H&R Block from this now on
1,"I've been using this anti-virus for several years and have had no significant system disruptions caused by viruses or malware infecting my computer.  I check my system with other anti-virus programs and periodic scans that always come up negative for<br />anything serious.  No anti-virus program is 100% foolproof, but this one comes about as close to any that are available now.<br />It is a little over zealous in eliminating some apps to speed up my system, if I allow it to do so.  Overall, it is well deserving of a<br />5 star rating and I'd recommend it as a replacement to some of the installed subscription programs placed on new computers."
0,"The Deluxe provided the forms to file a State return (Kansas), however two things were confusing:<br />Kansas assesses an additional  $19.99 to efile which the taxpayer isn't privy to until getting through the entire state filing. When I tried to back out and file my State via paper return, I couldn't tell if I had really filed my state because evidently, Kansas doesn't accept a state return until the Federal return is approved. I had to keep going through it several times to get back to the place where I could file State via a paper return."
0,"I use this software every year to do my taxes but every year,  I feel Turbo Tax needs to put more work the interface to make it even friendlier. I still don't feel they quite comfortable with it."
1,Love it
0,"Used 2012 version without a single problem.  Installed 2013 and have constant issues with a corrupt file, software crashing, difficult tech support etc.  Wish MS Money was still available to give me another PC based option."
1,wanderful!
1,"I used to use AVG, but after having numerous problems with it interfering with my internet connection, I switched to Avast! 3 years ago.  I have never had a virus or any malware on this machine, and Avast has run quietly behind the scenes, with less intrusion than AVG.  Plus, at the time I made the switch, benchmark data showed Avast to be a better product at catching viruses and malware.  Since all PCs need Antivirus protection, I heartily recommend Avast as the one to use!"
1,I've been using norton for at least 10 years and about 5 years thru Amazon download and to me it's even better off of Amazon it's quick easy and reliable for me haven't had any issues.
1,"THIS PRODUCT DOES WHAT IT SAYS,The price was perfect,my pcs are protected ."
1,I strongly recommend this antivirus product.  It updates regularly and is effective in protecting your computer. We use it at home and at work!
1,great reliable product
1,I absolutely love QuickBooks for my business.  It is easy to use and gives me all the reports I would ever need.
1,Free antivirus seems to work great. I haven't had any issues with it. My computer has stayed virus free since I have used it.
1,"I've used Turbo Tax for more than 10 years to file our income tax. It's such an easy and fast process. Our taxes aren't complicated, so I'm finished in about 15 to 20 minutes. I love how Turbo Tax pulls information from prior tax returns to fill in the blanks. The program offers &#34;help&#34; every step of the way. I normally purchase an actual copy of the program but the last two years have downloaded the software from Amazon and have had no problems at all. It's good Intuit offers Basic and Deluxe versions as the Basic works just fine for me and it's cheaper. E-filing is fast and you're notified as to the successful transmission of your return and when IRS accepts your return. Excellent product!"
1,great for a free antivirus
0,The software just stopped for no reason. I don't know what is wrong with it except that it's saying &#34;There was an error with the license. Please contact your vendor for assistance. 209&#34;
0,"The only reason I purchased the upgrade was that Intuit said the old version would no longer be able to update bank and credit card transactions after April 2015.  Terrible software.  The old one was SO much better.  If I could get my money back, I totally would.  I am thinking of reinstalling my old software and updating it manually.  At least it worked.  This software is so buggy and slow, I would not recommend the purchase."
0,Why do I need to enter my Credit Card information? I do not want to take a chance of being charged for something later on. Is this to use only for a limited time - then be charged if you want to continue?
1,"I had tried another brand of tax software and it was horrible.<br />As soon as I switched to Turbo Tax, I was happy (OK, well, as happy as anyone can be to do their taxes...)"
0,"had plenty of trouble download it 1st, then cannot install it in win7 pc.<br />I need to drive back and forth to fix this.<br />Will try again tonight, :("
0,"I am reviewing the online version at HRblock.com.  I used their taxcut software for years.  This year, I couldn't import.  They don't tell you but until after you've spent the entire day inputing your info that filing the state costs an extra 39.95.  Total for the deluxe + state $96 after coupon.  After you've paid for the software, which includes e-filing, they tell me I can't efile.  It's already 10pm on tax day and I now I have to print and mail a return.  Really. Lastly, they tell me I have an error:  in fact, their software told me that I had to put an item from my W2 in a certain place, and their software is telling me it's an error.  Ridiculous.  Finally, after paying for the deluxe version because my wife has a limited partnership investment, they tell me (again after spending hours inputing data), that continuing to use the software will result in an incomplete return and I have to go to an H&R block brick and mortar office to have my taxes done.    This software went from being a viable alternative to Turbo Tax, to being a waste of time and money, and a potential audit liability.     What a mistake to use H&R block."
1,This is a great AV software package. It has automatic virus updates and an included email scanner on incoming and outgoing emails. I give it five stars for the the performance and features on a free software program.
1,"Norton I find to be a capable and reliable anti-virus product.  It works as it should, it defends the system against any malicious threat and it does well working in the background of the OS with little interference with other programs.  Overall its a product that lives up to its promise, and one I highly recommend to keep your machine and operating system safe."
0,Still cost to much.
1,No quite full PS but does what I need it to do.
1,"I like it and it performs well for my needs, don't have very complicated finances, a few checking/savings, mortgage, retirement and investment accounts, it helps me keep an eye on all my accounts in one central locations, it downloads transactions from all my banks and despite its short comings/bugs its still the best option I have found that will run on Mac, I have used Quicken Windows for years and when transitioned to Mac I used briefly Quicken Essentials, then I went back to Quicken Windows via Parallels, tried iBank, See, Money Dance, you name it, and after all I personally like Quicken 2015 the best, the other competitors options may have some features that Quicken 2015 doesn't have but they don't apply to my needs, the only feature that I need is the ability to add security prices manually which I understand that is a feature coming soon. For someone without complicated investments I would definitely recommend it"
1,The standard in word processing
1,"Its really great for school and website projects though Android no longer supports flash (bummer). Nonetheless, its a great product."
1,"I had Norton Antivirus on my PCs so the first step it wanted to do was to uninstall. OK, then it wants to reboot. It doesn't automatically install after the reboot. I had to manually start it again. Then it got worse. I was getting a Renew message from the old version before I started the install (which I never do since it cost over twice as much) and now I get exactly the same Renew message. You have to click Renew in order to enter the Key and get the software to run. How about something that pops up and just says enter the key?<br /><br />Installation should be easy, one click to start, maybe click OK to a couple of prompts, that's all. Otherwise, it's great, just the right amount of protection without a lot of interference."
1,works flawlessly on win 8
1,Great product.
0,"I bought this product because my bank suggested it to me.  Little did I know that my bank isn't actually on the automatic sync list. If your bank isn't on the list, plan on entering each of your transactions manually. Alternatively you could go through some complicated process of importing your online bank histories into a cash account, as Quicken won't let you import histories for checking or savings accounts.  I'm sure this product is fine if your accounts are with a major banking institution.  I would be leery if you bank with a credit union or regional bank though."
0,Problem to Install the software! ERROR 1609!<br />I want my money back because this software dont install (windows 7)!<br />THIS IS A LOOSE OF TIME AND MONEY!
1,Just what I needed.
1,Very much improved over the Quicken Essentials but I just do the simple stuff.
0,This free download is horrible and will compromise your computer. Do not use it if you value your privacy and freedom.
1,"I used this to do my taxes and taxes of a relative who filed an extension.  My computer crashed and I could not locate the disk.  However I had saved the order info, contacted H & R block - and was able to download again...  Easy step by step tax prep.  I highly recommend."
1,This product was an easy install and very easy to use.  It was also priced right.  I don't have much need for this on my home computer but it's nice for the rare occasions when I do need to create a document.
1,"Been using Norton NIS for years. Works great for me. But when renewal time comes along, it always seems way cheaper to buy a new copy from Amazon, than to renew online with Symantec."
1,Started with iPhoto on my mac and moved to Aperture. Now on to Lightroom and I love the program. Great improvement in both file organization and editing tools.
1,Saved me more times than I can count
1,"Tried to get by for a while using open source tools and Google docs.  But there were too many little glitches to be reliable for professional correspondence with the majority of PC users out there.  MS Office for the Mac seems to work fine, but I really don't use a lot of the more advanced features available in the product suite.  I dislike Microsoft products in general, but these seem to do what I need to get done without crashing too often.  Updates are more frequent than most other software on the Mac, but less frequent than updates on the PC side."
1,"Will be switching to this from now on.  Basically exactly the same as TT from what I can tell, but cheaper."
1,"I have been using Avast at home for years. It has always done a great job protecting my PCs and the Return on investment (ROI) is good. I purchased Avast Home server for my Microsoft Home Server OS (WHS). Avast worked perfectly protecting all my files for years. I had a 3 year license. I only have one concern, Avast is no longer available for WHS. Otherwise I still employ Avast on all my PCs and Smart phones. I only trust 2 other antivirus programs and one of those is an enterprise solution so it is not cost effective for use at home."
1,"I have been using Avasti! for several years, and have never had a virus get past it to infect my computer. It keeps uploading its database to keep itself current. It has added some free features that also help you keep your computer updated. Will use this program in the future, and have told my friends about it."
0,"Very disappointed in Quicken 2014.  I upgraded from the 2012 version and found the new version to be very slow with many of the convenient features I used in the past no longer functioning (Ctrl-D to delete a transaction, Ctrl-M to memorize)."
1,Been using Quicken for seems like forever.  2015 does not seem to be much of an upgrade over 2012 -- the version I was FORCED to upgrade from when Intuit's planned obsolescence kicked in.  I dont really notice any changes so for.
1,"This is the easiest and fastest way to print envelopes and save your addresses I have ever seen.  The download was lightning fast, too!"
1,"A very nice app/software with granular scheduling options to backup and recovery files, partitions or whole drives. Really helped me to recover my system from previous restoration points and that too in couple of seconds.<br /><br />Does not take up too much space (good thing when it comes to SSD),<br />Snapshots and restoration is quite fast.<br />Protects all my computer and it's integrity"
0,I thought it was a full service of clip art. Nooooo it's less than 100 BAD items and damn expensive. Can I delete and get a refund?
0,"I bought this on June 22 of this year. Went to use it again today, and my registration is rejected. This sucks"
1,This was very easy to use.  It even works with someone who is self employed.  I would recommend it to others.
0,"I've been using QB for many years now.  When I updated to this version, I continually received error message popups whenever the program was running.  This is related to the Intuit Synch routine that runs in &#34;processes&#34;.  After several calls to support, which is often painful these days with Intuit, I was finally informed by one of the reps that this is a known issue in some cases that they have not yet resolved.<br /><br />To make matters worse, although Intuit issued a refund check, the check could not be cashed because it was not on Intuit's &#34;positive pay&#34; list and a second check was issued after a month passed only when I got Amazon to intervene with Intuit."
0,"If you are switching from the Windows Version to the Mac version -- think about it long and hard. I used the Mac Quicken 2015 for 48 hours and requested a refund.  There are a LOT of differences both cosmetic and functional between the Windows and the Mac Version.  I was moving from Windows Quicken 2012 to Mac Quicken 2015.  Everyone's experience is different of course and we all have our favorite features in any program, HOWEVER here are the things that made me decide to stick with the Windows Version:  (1) The QMac does not track payroll deductions (2) I had over 10 years of data and during the conversion everything except numbers was stripped out of the &#34;Check Number&#34; column in my checking account -- Since I have always used a debit/visa checkcard more than checks I put the code ChkCrd there when I paid with my debit/checkcard, and DEP for deposits, and EFT for bills I paid online using a direct payment -- all of those alpha characters were stripped out by the conversion utility.  (3) the conversion utility did a pretty good job at converting most of the accounts however in my checking account, it doubled my auto loan payments throwing off both my loan account and my checking account.  It took me about an hour of digging to figure out why the accounts were off. (4) you can not have your register display in two rows -- I'm in my 50's.  Checking account registers are SUPPOSED to have two rows.  That's the way I've seen it all my life.  That is the way I want to see it now.  Not rational, I know, but I want it.  They should let me do it.  So there!  LOL.  BUT... and this is a BIG BUT....  The straw that made me toss in the proverbial towel and ask for the refund was the reconcile account feature:  It is totally different.  So different that I could not figure out how it works -- even after doing a &#34;how to&#34; search on the web.  That is a core feature I use every single day and at that point I'd had enough!  I asked for a refund -- Still waiting to hear back from Intuit, but Amazon Customer Service has been awesome!back from Intuit, but Amazon Customer Service has been awesome!"
1,"A computer guy installed avast after I had problems with microsoft essentials, so far I've had no problems and it has worked well for me."
0,The product wasn't helpful at all. Ended up deleting it ten minutes later. I would not recommend this to anyone.
0,"I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Autodesk.  I have used Autocad software since the mid 1990's and I purchased Autocad LT 2015 some 6 months ago thru Amazon. I purchased the stand alone license with the dvd software.  I recently purchased a new Lenovo laptop and tried to load Autocad LT 1015 software onto it using a dvd drive.  I could not activate the software no matter how many times I sent emails to Autocad requesting a new activation code and uninstalling the software and re-installing it.  Since I am leaving on a business trip tomorrow and could not get any help from Autodesk on this installation problem and without my cadd software I lose $$$ per day, I had to spend another $1200 with Amazon to purchase yet another copy of Autocad 2015.  Believe me when I say if I could find another cadd software to use for my business I would buy it in a second.  I don not know how the support team at Autodesk can sleep at night know how they leave customers who pay so much money for their product in the lurch.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
0,"It was once a great product that did what it was supposed to do. Now, I am hounded by attempts to get me to purchase features I don't want and I cannot turn those advertisements off.  It still protects my system, but the messages are beginning to make it less of a great deal."
1,Works as it should. Did a download so can't comment on how long it would take to get it. Have no more to say just want to have enough words to rate this.
1,"I just started using QB Online and I am decidedly NOT an accountant. I do marketing, and do it well, which is why I started my business. But I must keep track of revenue, expenses, invoices, payments, etc., and that's where QuickBooks Online comes in.<br /><br />Very intuitive, very easy, gets the job done.<br /><br />I like having a cloud-based resource that I can count on and access from anywhere. It's connected to my other financial tools, making tracking credit card purchases, etc. simple."
0,I started the download at 10:30 this morning it is now 5:00 pm and it is still not done downloading. I have DSL not the fastest available but this is ridiculous.
1,"I've been using H&R Block's software for years and it does a very good job of walking you through the task of filing taxes.  You still need to get all your information together and have a basic understanding of how to work through your taxes, but $40 is better than $400 to have someone else do it for you."
0,"bought this and cannot use because intuit removed several needed features like schedule C, D, E.  I have spent money for this useless item and I guess I have no recourse to return to Amazon or upgrade to the needed product.  Seems both Amazon and Intuit are complicit in this decision to allow Turbo Tax Deluxe to go forward for sale and not inform the previous users in a proactive manner like sending them a heads up email way in advance of purchasing for the 2014 tax season.  They have our email so why not let us know in advance that they are basically increasing the price for the same functionality we have used for years."
0,"Very limited options, unless you spend a lot of time."
1,"Excellent product.  Easy to use, imports nicely, fast, auto-updates and accurate.  I have used it for 16 years and it gets better and better."
1,"I have always been leery of Quickbooks.  When intuit launched the online version, I thought I would give it a try.  I've been very impressed with how easy it is to use and convenient the tools are across various devices.  I would highly recommend Quickbooks Online!"
0,"I am very frustrated about this not working, I have gone back and forth, from amazon to Microsoft trying to get this resolved.  I finally received a refund from Amazon.  After all the hassle, I still don't have the software that I needed two days ago.  The question is, do I try to download again or  spend the extra money and buy it a different way.  This was a total pain in my neck!!!!"
1,It's alright
0,"This product is not at all what I needed or wanted, I also feel it was described inaccurately. I would NOT recommend anyone purchase this product!!!"
1,"Running a small business is tough.  Computer software like QuickBooks is meant to aid us in our business development and profitability.  Unfortunately, most of the software out there talks a good game, but falls short of its promises.  I have never had that problem with QuickBooks.  QuickBooks Online improves on an already nearly perfect system.  The best part?  Updates come out regularly and they actually target the things you might have been complaining about.  Its like Intuit actually pays attention to what customers have problems with.  More software companies should take note of quality and attention to functionality of QuickBooks.  Selling a product is 10x easier when the product is the best in the market and that is what QuickBooks is."
1,Did everything that i needed the program to do.
0,"Had Quicken 2011 and was forced to upgrade to continue to Download bank info.<br /><br />No new features of worth, just a pain to learn all over again how to do commands, because of course they changed the formats!<br /><br />Only positive, it was cheaper on Amazon than any where else!"
1,"I depend on Quicken for Mac to keep track of personal finances, and I also depend on upgrades to my iMac.  When the new OSx operating systems no longer supported Quicken, I was in a quandary, and grudgingly decided to delay upgrading my OS until there was a new viable Mac version of Quicken, because my financial records were more important.  FINALLY -- after several years -- Quicken for Mac 2015 came out -- about time!!  It enabled me to do a long-overdue upgrade of my Mac OS.  And as a bonus, Q2015 seems much superior to the Q2007 it replaced -- at least, my brief experience with it has been highly positive, though it took some getting used to -- whole new \\""look and feel.\\"""
1,Did its job nicely - did not let any chance to complain.
0,"Why is Mr Bill a billionaire? Because after you buy his product you have to pay him more to use it.

1,Independent reviews rate this software virtually as good as TurboTax and you save $$. I purchased last years version and found it to be no different than TurboTax in ease of use and efficiency at finding ways to save paying more taxes than you need to.
1,"I love Malwarebytes.  I have been able to clear many monsters off of peoples computers using the free download.  This thing finds EVERYTHING, it does really well and catches stuff before you even get on the website.  Very reliable product that runs in the backroom and has very minimal effect on performance, which is a huge plus and exactly what I look for when it comes to an anti virus."
1,"I have been using Avast for about five years now and have never had an issue with viruses, worms, trojans and the like. Since using Avast, it has also warned me about malecious web sites and the like. I have nothing but high praise for Avast, and I should know because I have been a compuiter tech for almost thirty years. I consistently recommended it to my friends, family and colleages with confidence, knowing that it is a fantastic program. Bravo Zulu! (Oh ya, I'm former career Navy also.)"
1,I have used this product for a couple years now and I am very pleased with its performance.  I recommend this product.
0,"I thought Intuit would have learned from its previous ill conceived attempts to screw TT customers -- guess not.  This year's changes meant that I would have had to jump from Deluxe up 2 steps to the most expensive package more than doubling my cost.  I have used TT for almost 2 decades and now I am gone forever -- as they say, TT is dead to me.  I bought H&R Block Deluxe and have been working with it for a day and so far it is handling everything about my fairly complex return with ease - txf imports, K-1s, hundreds of stock transactions, 1256 contracts, etc.  Of course it it fails me in the next few days I'll have to eat my words and submit to Intuit's jackboot tactics, but it is not looking like that will be necessary and should I need to you may rest assured I will be vigilantly looking for my earliest possible exit from TT.  By the way TT almost lost me forever the last time Intuit put their boot to our throats.  I used TaxCut that year.  It did an acceptable job but was not quite polished enough at that point so I went back to TT.  The H&R Block product is much more mature now and I doubt I will see any reason to darken Intuit's doors again.  auf Wiedersehen!"
0,"Does not import from versions of Quickbooks older than 2009.  Because, you know, basic bookkeeping and accounting are WAY different now than 6 years ago.  I'm doing all my bookkeeping and tax work using the Intuit family of products and I have to manually enter my book figures?  But, guess what!  For a mere $200 more I can upgrade to a newer version of QB and my problems will be magically solved!  Or, I could abandon Intuit and escape their greedy tricks once and for all."
1,I still think it's a rip off that you have to pay another 20 dollars for state efiling which kind of makes this a bad deal. But I am use to using TurboTax. I used H and R Block before and didn't like it.
1,Added to existing PC as a upgrade.  Works well for tuning up digital pictures.  Change in 10 to 11 was not a difficult learning curve.
1,I've been using Turbo Tax for the past four years because of the professional guidance at my own time and pace.
0,"I didn't buy this software thru Amazon, I bought it directly thru BitDefender using a discount code I received, and based upon high ratings it received on CNET.  I purchased the Anti-Virus 2013 edition with 3 computer licenses.<br /><br />The software itself seems relatively compentent at detecting or preventing malware, but I experienced so many problems that I ended up uninstalling and purchasing a different AV utility.<br /><br />1.  The non-intuitive interface didn't cause me too much grief, but I installed it on my wife's computer and she really didn't like having to dig down thru layers to just start a scan, or see the results of an auto-scan.<br /><br />2.  Performance on the computer seemed to be impacted, especially slowing down significantly interactive web sites that used flash, silverlight, java, etc.<br /><br />3.  The software continually thru false positives on windows registry files during auto-scans<br /><br />4.  The software repeatedly popped up spamware ads offering me additional fee add ons (some sort of \\""premium tuneup\\"").  I can understand this for freeware/trialware software, but this was for an already paid subscription less than 100 days into a full years subscription.  The unacceptable kicker was that these popups behaved very much like fake anti-virus malware (it was in a window without a close button, there was no icon for it on the task bar to minimize or close it, it didn't show up as a process to be killed, etc)<br /><br />5.  The final straw was when I contacted support about why I was being hit up, as a paying customer, with these additional fee add ons.  It took over two weeks to be emailed back a response in which I was told that the ads could not be disabled or deactivated, but \\""However, you can try to disable them by following the instructions listed below\\"" (literal copy/paste from their response) and provided instructions for tweaking the registry to fool the software so that it couldn't find the content for the popup ads.<br /><br />6.  When I replied that this was not an acceptable solution, that I found their business practices unscrupulous, and that I wanted to cancel my subscription and request a refund for time remaining, they bluntly said in effect 'sorry you are past 30 days, no refunds for you'.<br /><br />7.  I decided to just eat the cost instead of fighting about it, and went to cancel my subscription and make sure that auto-renewal was disabled.  But guess what, you can't do that on the site.  The only link for canceling your auto-renewal opens an email to support again.  So I uninstalled from both computers, purchased and installed another product, and now have to monitor my credit card bill as I fully expect this company to charge me again even though their last email promised that they wouldn't.  There's just too much sleazy business morality on display here for me to expect them to actually follow thru not to continue charging me."

1,After several years of Charter Security Suite clogging up my computer I decided to look for something different. I'm a cheap ass and did not want to pay a yearly subscription for something I could get for nothing so I started searching. After researching several options I decided on avast! It was a snap to load up and setting it up was not an issue. I have had zero viruses and no issues since. It only takes up 324MB of space and does not slow my computer down as Charter did. There are a few prompts for upgrading but nothing intrusive.

1,"I'm mostly only writing my review to offset the wave of negative comments.  I had absolutely no problems with the Amazon software download tool.  If you are concerned that you might have a problem with it, just test it out first by downloading a free game or something.  Next, someone complained that the amazon downloader tool remains on your system after the download - this is true unfortunately, but its also not a big deal, it shows an icon in the bottom right corner of your screen, and you can simply right click it, and close it, it will then ask you if you want to load it when windows starts, just uncheck this, and it will no longer be running on your computer.  Finally, some people complained that they didn't get their product code.  I don't know if this was a bug that was fixed or what, but the downloader software clearly displayed my product code (used for e-filing your return), furthermore, you can get the code at any time via Amazon.com, just click on the \\""Go to your software library\\"" button.    The H&R Block software loaded fine on Vista with no problems.  If you are using user account controls, you should right click the install file and choose \\""Run as Administrator\\"".  After the software installed, the first thing it did was update itself.  Now I must admit it did appear to hang during this update process for some reason showing it was 100% on the download, and I had to click \\""cancel\\"" but then it installed the update with no problems after that.      The tax software is very nice, most detailed reviews I've read comparing various software rank H&R Block (formerly TaxCut) and TurboTax as the two best, and they mostly say they are almost identical but as far as I know, only H&R Block offers audit support.  You can import last years files from either software so switching from year to year is not a problem.  Every year these programs get better and better, with more features and forms, and simpler interface.  I love the simple question and answer format, andthe easy free federal e-File.  I also like that it includes the state software too.  Instead of paying extra to e-File my state return, I just print it out and mail it in (for only the cost of a stamp).  This software handles everything I want to do including Schedule D creation, and even schedule F for farm income.  Overall its a good value."
1,"Easy, fast, and accurate.  It's great being able to download the program from Amazon without having to wait for it.  Being able to file online is also a big plus.  Program updates whenever a new update is available."
1,"I was hesitant to buy this via download based on another review but I bought and downloaded it 01/22/2011 and the download was easy with no problems and so was the install. There are number of separate steps in the process but it was fast and easy AND you get the ability to re-do it if needed. The whole process is within AMAZON too which is great. I used Mac OSX version 10.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.13.  As far as the program, I have not used it yet, but last year's was OK. I wrote this because I wanted to tell others that downloading works fine. Just take your time and read what is on the screen and the instructions presented. I only rated it a 4 stars as the program is never going to be perfect and never was in prior years. Just note that I have not actually used it yet."
0,"I agree with the poor reviews. The software was downloaded, installed, and when starting I get a splash screen and then quicken terminates. I don't get issues with installing other programs. You would think that a business that has been making software for 30 years would get it right. I'm frustrated and I don't have an extra hour to speak with a customer service rep.  I will be asking for a refund. UGGGG!"
0,too pricey compared to the freely available Libreoffice. It is not worth more than 20-30$. I would not recommend it.
1,I needed a fast and reliable download<br />Norton is a good product<br />I was tired of looking for coupons in the newspaper and the cost of gas made this a great deal
1,"i just purchased this product and have found it to be excellent, it has every file type to be found and is very user friendly and fast. great product"
1,Turbotax always gets me the best refund and it's so easy to use. I wouldn't recommend anything else.
1,"No problems on a Mac. The program worked well, updated fine, and filed the taxes on time. The Amazon download delivery system worked perfectly."
1,"So far I have been pleased with Avast antivirus and have had no issues,. Will buy it again.  Tony,  Freeport Pa"
0,This is unacceptable from Amazon to sell software with a virus  My Quicken 2012 was working fine and now I had to put up with this stupit program why??
1,Thought it was harder to use this year.<br />First version was way better 10 years ago.<br />Bought it because I needed it and that is all.
1,This worked just as I needed it too for my simple and easy super duper taxes that I am one year late on
0,Easy to use. There are a lot of updates so it's best to wait to file.
1,"Downloaded fast and easy.  I am a former Turbo Tax user that switched to H&R after horrible reviews of the 2014 TT software.  I am glad I listened to the reviews (after careful consideration of course of very many reviews from amazon and other websites.  I dont really have a complicated case,  only rental expenses.  I got the premium.  It was a breeze, easy and cheap!"
1,it is good especially considering its price.
1,"I gave Avast five stars because it is so unobtrusive. It works in the background, and it certainly doesn't seem to slow down my computer even when I'm doing intensive graphic work. ( I have an HP core i3 2120). When I download a program or file, Avast checks it and if it is a problem, it promptly stops the file/program, and give me a warning. I LIKE that it stops the downloaded software if it is risky. I have the free version on both my desktop and my laptop. I feel so secure with Avast, that if they had a version that would go on my Nook HD+ , I'd install it without a moments hesitation. I can't really think of anything to dislike, although finding a way to disable it to download safe programs that tell my to do so is problematic. But that is probably my fault, since I don't do that often. Again, I highly recommend this product!"
1,"I have a macbook and got it after college so I hadn't needed any word processing. Love my mac by the word processor sucks and I had to break down to buy this. I did the download-some reviewers had issues, or said it took hours. I think the download took about 30 mins at most and went smoothly. The programs seem to work just as they should."
0,"I have been using Quicken since 1993, and had several versions. I live in South America and use two diferent currencies, US$ and local. Everything works great, I get the info I need and it is quite easy to use and set up, but there is no support for other currencies.<br /><br />First, I cannot use a second currency with Quicken Cloud, which is a real problem, because I have only 50% of the  info online. Useless.<br /><br />Up to Quicken 2011, if made a transfer from a US$ account to a local currency account, it used the exchange rate I registered. If the amount I transferred had a diferent rate, I could later go to my local account and change the amount without doing the whole thing again.<br /><br />But, since 2014, if have to change the amount in my local account, I have to go back to the original transfer and do it again, using the new exchange rate, this gets even more complicated when it is part of split transaction, now I have to do the whole thing again. This happens all the time, specially when I pay taxes.<br /><br />So really, why did you remove this feature and why doesn´t Quicken Clud support a second currency.<br /><br />You get a two just for this, otherwise, you would get a five."
0,"The personal software works at a 5 star level.<br /><br />Business software works, but you have to be vigilant, and know what you're doing on some level. This was my first year using the CA state forms, and the software generated a lot of forms that were unnecessary, and kept flagging my corporation's # with the Sec of State as being incorrect. Software could be cleaned up a bit so the check boxes in the interview aren't mis-aligned.<br /><br />But generally it does the job, saves me from paying an accountant for a fairly straight-forward return, and gets me where I need to go."
0,"I really wanted to like this product.  The AV engine is great, and very low impact with a high degree of protection.  But the rest of the sute is sub-par at best.<br /><br />In particular I still use Outlook due to work requirements.  The spam engine might as well be just turned off, the built in engine for MS Outlook does a better job than the built in spam filter.  It would incorrectly filter out people who where in my address book as spam, I tried to resolve this through support (which btw took them over a week to respond), with no luck.  I was using ESET before, and while it was not perfect, it sure caught more spam email and adjusted to what &#34;I&#34; considered as spam vs. what the program decided was spam.<br /><br />The various phishing filters and Safe Money with the built in Keyboard, are not worth the additional money.  I understand what they are trying to do here, but the implementation leaves much to be desired.  It tends to get in the way vs. being hidden in the background working behind the scenes/<br /><br />In retrospect, if I renew, it will be just for the AV side of things.  The Internet Security Suite is simply not worth the additional money.."
0,It does not present the constitution or amendments in a continuous readable form with footnotes.  Instead it presents a menu where you have to select each sentence to stumble through the text.  It does not attribute authorship of any particular clause wherever that information may be known.  app also drops icon on desktop that is always on top of other apps.  I deleted this worthless app about 8 hours after installing it.
1,H&R Block Tax software is easy to use with step by step instructions and entries. Adequate FAQ and error check. I compared H&R Block Tax software with another higher priced tax software with same data and got identical tax refund values from both. Do not trust other software user postings regarding claims of more tax refund than H&R Block Tax software.
1,"Fast, easy to understand and follow. Great way to get your taxes done."
0,trial version is pretty dreadful
1,"It's okay.  I found out I could have bought it at Staples during School Supply Weeks for $5.00.  Or, you can download it for free from their website.  It must think I'm still on the free version; I still get announcements telling me to upgrade to the newest edition, even though I bought it!"
1,As far as I know of everything has been just great computer protected and program working good trial over then I had to reinstall through Norton company itself but good!
0,I have been a loyal TT customer for over 20 years and shocked again by their price gouging with this new bait and switch to Premier from either Basic or Deluxe Version in prior year. I think that Bob Meighan has lost his mind in thinking customers will blindly follow him off the cliff. This should be the beginning of the end for Turbo Tax products. I remember Bob from Price Waterhouse as a good guy and do not understand where he lost his way this year. I will not purchase Premier and hereby end my relationship with Turbo Tax & Intuit after an over 20 year customer relationship.    Remember Palm Pilot and Blackberry? Turbo Tax will be next with this arrogant thinking that they have a monopoly in tax software and can do as they please.
0,It did not hve the state filing included it lied..I had to pay an extra 39.99 to download state and then it didn't even download or install the state filing.  I was very unhappy with the purchase. I had to go out and actually buy the software because this was the second time it happened.
0,"I completed my 2014 taxes using the software, sent it off, then received two confirmation emails - one from H&R Block & one from IRS stating &#34;Congratulations, your 2014 taxes are complete.  Yesterday I received a letter from the IRS indicating my taxes were not paid and was assessed a penalty & interest.  Spent the next 3 hours calling H&R block local, and then toll free 3 times, speaking to 3 different individuals after working my way through automated reply systems.  They referred me to a 3rd party usatax.  The first representative gave me an incorrect phone #.  The 2nd gave me a correct one.  After talking to usatax, they had no record of me, and said the error was on H&R blocks side for entering info incorrectly.  So called H&R the third time-no resolution to the problem.  Guess I'll just pay the penalty and have it over with."
1,Cheaper than the online version. Also... using the Basic version allows you to save previous years and import the data. SO MUCH EASIER than the &#34;free&#34; version.
1,"Despite all of the horror stories I have read on here, I decided to upgrade from Quicken Deluxe 2011 to Quicken Home and Business 2013. The main reason I did the upgrade so soon is because we had a need to track business expenses and do invoicing, which Quicken H&B can do on a small scale.<br /><br />As far as installation, I didn't have any issues. During installation the program downloaded updates and the version I had after install was R2. So perhaps they fixed some issues with these updates. For some reason it took about a half-hour to download the 96 MB file install from Amazon, but that is an Amazon problem.<br /><br />The program converted my 2011 file over without any problems. The first time I did the online direct connect update it came back with some errors saying that it couldn't download transactions from a few credit card accounts. The program had a troubleshooting dialogue/wizard that basically resets the online information for the affected accounts and it fixed the issues.<br /><br />Now with the Quicken Cloud. When I first went to create a cloud account the program hung for a long time, eventually I just killed the program under task manager. Figuring that this was still a work in progress I didn't pursue getting it to work, thinking a fix will be out soon. Out of curiosity, I downloaded the iPad app and used the login information even though it didn't seem to create an account when the program hung on me. But to my surprise the login worked and my account data was there. It looks like when you do your online account updates it also updates your Quicken Cloud account. So although the Quicken Cloud interface selected from the menu doesn't seem to work, it does seem to update OK in the background.<br /><br />However so far I have found the iPad app to be pretty unimpressive. It pretty much just shows your accounts and transactions, in a sort of clunky way. For example if you enter your paycheck in as a split transaction with all of the line items liketaxes, medicare, etc like I do, it lists the paycheck transaction as separate lines for each deduction. So when you go to look at your transactions your paycheck takes up an entire page. And as a previous reviewer stated, it only syncs bank and credit card accounts. So I hope that can be improved.<br /><br />The overall account list and register interface doesn't seem to have changed much from 2011, everything seems to be in the same place. Although admittedly I haven't played with it too much since I bought it a few days ago. We started playing with the business features of the program, and they seem pretty intuitive and useful."
1,this was a fantastice deal. Thank you very much. The the download was easy.. I will be back to buy again in the future!
1,"Although it isn't perfect and took a lot of getting used to after Quicken 2007, it's far better than other reviewers had lead me to believe. I've been using Quicken on the Mac for decades and was worried about my financial history getting messed up. I did have a few issues with my investment accounts but they were not too difficult to fix after I found info on one of the forums. I haven't been wild about the way account reconciliation works and a few other small details, but overall it is a relief to be on the latest version and not dependent on really old software to do such an important job. I do like the look and feel generally, as it is easier to see the big picture at a glance."
0,"It's ridiculous and insulting that the 1099A support was removed from this year's Turbo Tax Deluxe and moved into a version (Home/Business) that costs twice as much. Vote with your dollars, and use Tax Act instead this year instead."
1,The TurboTax software has good information and tips for a better refund. I will definitely buy next year for the tax season.
1,"I have not used an office suite for some time now, so i do not have much to compare to (except open office). By far a stellar product and very universal. A must for any student"
1,"I've used H&R Block now for several years.  Really like it.  Price is better here on Amazon than from H&R direct AND Amazon keeps a backup of previous years programs, which can really come in handy - like when I had to do a correction from a previous year."
1,"excellent price, instant download, delivery by amazon is the best.  the product had a few glitches w/ usbank but now it seems fixed.  nice advancements over 2011"
1,"Even the free Avast! account for viruses, spyware & malware is excellent! I was lucky to buy this, believe me. I had an Alienware from before the Dell takeover and a piece of malware totally destroyed it. When I got my new computer I installed Avast! immediately. There were indeed a several instances where it would stop me before loading a page that turned out to have malware of some kind & I was damned glad. You can hardly do better than Avast! unless you can create your own security program by hand. In which case you can probably not have to worry"
1,"The thing I like about VX Ace is it's only as complicated as you want to make it. Try out the free Lite demo version and you can make a fun game for your friends in a week or two. Put more time and effort into the full version and you can make a freeware game that might get some attention. Put a lot of hard work into resources and scripting and you can even make a professional game. The heavy duty tools are there if you want them, but the simple tools are all you really need for simple projects.<br /><br />Long story short: You can do some cool things with this, but you're allowed to get it just for fun. :)"
1,"It's so amazing that something like this is even available.  All we had to do was enter a code, No CD Installation or anything like that, and it is the most wonderful thing ever.  Now I just click on my virtual PC and can still use all my software that wouldn't run on Windows 7. Everything is once again available for use.<br /><br />THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY LIFE WHOLE AGAIN."
1,"I saved myself a TON (a literal TON) of money on doing my taxes this year doing it using TurboTax.<br />I was very apprehensive on doing them myself but going to a brick and mortor service was just a ridiculously high price. The process of downloading the software was easy, purchasing multiple states was easy, walking through the process was detailed but straight forward and submitting them was easy. I will never go back to person assisted taxes after using this software!"
0,"Had a hard time downloading, due to my machine and provider. I like the AVG product, but buy it before you get a virus that makes downloading hard."
1,Awesome product. Does what it advertises. No regrets!
0,"Purchased Quicken 2013 for upgrade from 2012.  Long time user - at least 12-15 years  Originally bought Download version which converted data and crashed.  Got refund from Amazon(I had the download for 24 hours) then repurchased 2013 Home Business version on disk, thinking it would help.<br />Disk version loads fine (note - Quicken seems to be OK if you are starting from scratch)  After loading 2012 data - Backup, copy, the system fails after conversion.  It does say \\""Sorry\\""<br />Contacted Quicken support and after a 1 hour wait, I tried what was suggested with no success.<br />During failure I get a different error code each time.  The report of what happened makes no sense.<br /><br />If a solution is not found, I'll try to get money back and stick with 2012.<br />I really like Quicken but am very disappointed and it seems they are the only game in town.  What has happened to this company?  I would rate the program \\""Zero\\"" stars if available"
0,"Absolutely the worst upgrade experience I've had with ANY product.<br /><br />When MS Money was discontinued (RIP) I moved to Quicken and although more cumbersome than Money, have gotten used to it and it's features. I moved to the 2013 version a couple of weeks ago and have had nothing but problems - existing accounts will not link, entries are duplicated or omitted, and most frustrating, the one-step update to accounts has not worked consistently since the upgrade. The help wizards are useless and I'm resigned to spending an afternoon to troubleshoot what should have been an automatic function.<br /><br />Oh, and the 'mobile' app that is the reason why I upgraded in the first place? It's a joke."
1,Returned item as I could not get it to work properly.
1,"I have used Norton products for years and they just keep improving! I've tried the others and I just keep coming back to Norton. As far as I am concerned, it's the best  security suite out there. And, it's not the big old &#34;bloatware&#34; (sorry fellows) that it used to be several years ago. You want the best, here you are."
1,Am very pleased with Moneydance and the support is excellent.  Highly recommend.
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for several years.  If you chose the right version, you will always be happy.  Price is fair when compared to a professional preparer."
1,I like Avast. I've used it for quite some time now. I would just like to see the number of popups reduced.
0,Locked up system.
1,"product is great as it is.  you do, however, still need to do the collecting of a year's worth of data. after the first yr you use it, the process becomes easier especially if you can organize your stuff throughout the year.  e.g., if you donate a lot, use their online entry form and at tax time the program will migrate to the appropriate page.  It's also nice to know the math is all accurately totaled if you enter it right."
0,"You know I really used to like TurboTax and Intuit's other products.  I thought they were high quality, professional, and trustworthy. I mean after all, I'm using their products for my money management and taxes, and if they are trustworthy, then I just don't feel comfortable using them.  I know businesses need to make a profit, and I'm sure Intuit is no exception, but they also need to provide an honest deal to the customer.  I feel I've have been betrayed.  What I experienced was low level bait and switch.  Buy this product to do your taxes only to find out there are hidden fees to complete the process you already started.<br /><br />Well you got me this time.. I hope you enjoy my hard earned money, and it pays for your bonuses, but next year I'll go somewhere else.  I'm sorry, I lost all trust for all of Intuit's products.  I plan on buying a new computer this year, and will not upgrade my Quicken software either.<br /><br />1 star, because it did the job and you and your software engineers earned that and no more than 1 star because your business team lost my trust."

1,"I have used a number of Antivirus programs that I paid for, and none of them were any better than the Avast  Free Antivirus program. This is a very good program."
1,"Great tool for post-production. I love how my photos look and how I can save the ones with minor exposure defects. I LOVE THIS SOFTWARE, to bad you can't update to a newer version since Adobe decided to stiff their clients with monthly fees to use their newer/updated software."
0,Turbo tax intuit is no longer the company I used to love. Kreepy marketing has left many confused and upset. Hard to determine actually which version u need. Kinda forcing u to buy the most expensive version. They lost there way somewhere along the line. And for the product.. Gives you different answers or figures for same input...every year they move the stuff around I guess to make u think they did something better. Wish I could say better things.. But they r scratching for every penny they can squeeze from you
0,"This doesn't seem to have many new features over the last version, and I am now having trouble downloading transactions. Should have stayed with 2012."
1,"I use it every year, and switched from turbo tax yeas ago when it got too expensive. Easily walks you through the process."
1,The previous antivirus I had &#34;Trend&#34; did not work anywhere as well as Avast<br /><br />Trend actually messed up my computer
1,"This is by far the best product that I have found for downloading any streaming video. The quality of the vids is much better than anything that I have tried, and they come out perfect every time. According to your needs, they can be converted to other formats, lots of free software to do that."
0,"I was forced into a 2010 upgrade due to deprecated support from an older version I was more than happy with. In my opinion this product gets worse each year. To continue to generate revenue each year, Intuit adds small features that are not well tested and bugged out. The QA department needs to step or the product is just to complex and feature rich to clean up. One bug example: I now have security accounts that show no value. In Quicken's over abundance of reports and windows dialog forms, nothing shows me why or how my securities ended up with misrepresented balances. I've been an avid quicken user since 1992. As of recent years, every once and a while, the over abundance of complex features and bugs like this one make spread sheets look better all the time."
0,"Slow!!!  With my earlier version of QuickBooks Pro my computer was peppy and lively when opening, running and closing that earlier version.  Now, with QuickBooks Pro 2015, a millstone has been tied to my processor whenever 2015 is open.  2015 takes forever to start.  In fact, in my initial times to use the program I \\""started\\"" 2015 several times while 2015 was still opening because 2015 was taking so long to open I thought I must not have clicked the mouse correctly to start the program, so I tried to open it again.  Now I just \\""start\\"" 2015 and then go make a pot of coffee or read \\""War and Peace\\"" or detail my car and figure 2015 will be up and running about the time I finish those tasks.  When I'm working in 2015 and I point and click a command, I always get the little blue spinning circle next to the pointer indicating Windows is taking a while to process the command because 2015 is so ponderous.  If you're trying to work in another program with 2015 open, the vampire that is 2015 is draining the speed of every other program.  QuickBooks Pro 2015 also is like one of those zombies in a movie; it won't die.  Closing 2015 is a slow, agonizing process and when you think its closed, you find the little blue circle still spinning and spinning and spinning.  Also, Intuit REALLY wants you to use Intuit Sync Manager and WILL NOT let you remove that command from your start-up menu and, if you close Intuit Sync Manager, 2015 replaces the Intuit Sync Manager on your toolbar every time you open 2015 despite your instructions that you don't want to use Intuit Syn Manager.<br /><br />If I didn't already have all years and years of data in QuickBooks, I'd try to find something different.  Now I realize that I just need to budget the price of a brand new, state-of-the-art computer into the cost of a new version of QuickBooks.  I've never been nostalgic about an earlier version of a program but QuickBooks Pro 2015 makes me long for that older, quicker, livelier QuickBooks.<br />Roger"
1,Downloading the Turbo Tax is quick and easy.  No need to wait for delivery to take place.  My preferred method of choice.
0,purchased a year subscripton. Worked for 2 months then they key expired..amazon says contact AVG..2 weeks later and LOTS of hours later..AVG's answer is ask for a refund and repurchase from them!
1,"I wish I had bought PC magic years ago. We have a 10 year old Dell. PC Matic speeded it up and it runs like an almost new computer! We didn't have to ditch out computer because of windows XP, either, since PC matic supports XP.  I also added this software to our new Dell Laptop and my kids used Dell Laptop.  Works great"
1,"Still hard to get through a person if you need technical software help. After an hour on the phone, I figured it out by myself."
1,"I have been using AVAST free for many years. It seems to run well and doesn't slow down my machine. It does a good job of catching the nasty things from getting on my machine.<br /><br />I like the fact that it does not interfere with performance of my machine. I like the fact it talks like a pirate to me :D. I would recommend people who want a light weight security solution use this, keep in mind that if you want more features you will have to buy their product, but I think even the paid version of AVAST would be a good buy."
0,"i am running this on my Windows 7 Machine, its great when it works, though when the machine goes into a sleep mode, often the software will hang with no recovery in site, then you start getting issues with adapters, the only fix is to reset the machine. I would recommend almost installing this on a dedicated machine to prevent any of these hickups. Though to be honest, when it work it works rather well. It will be interesting to see how it develops further."
1,"I do not like what Intuit's TurboTax did with the pricing of 2014 TurboTax and I do not like the explanations offered by Intuit's CEO on this site, but I am buying the top-of-the-line Home & Business version as luckily Amazon Prime members get a discounted price of $64.99....so I am not going to inconvenience myself for the $15 difference between this price and the $49.99 standard Amazon price of the Deluxe version.    My time is worth more than $15 in transferring the prior year info (let alone the history in the many years of use) and the Intuit product is still the best, even if their corporate strategy is flawed.  I have been a customer of TurboTax, QuickBooks, ProSeries professional tax software, even the old Direct Link corporate tax software since the 1980s and I am not really not looking to try other software.  Still a good buy at $64.99 and you get to 5 federal e-files included at no extra cost.    So let's keep this in perspective - $15 increase in price - same great TurboTax product."
1,I bought this because of previous positive experience w/ product. It seems to work fine. No problems installing. I would buy again.
0,Not worth the money or effort.  If I could return the download I would.  Too cumbersome and lacks features and functionality I've grown accustom to with Quicken.  Onward to Quicken for MAC.
1,We've used it in past years and found the software outstanding. I would recommend Turbo Tax to any and all. I found it well &#34;human engineered.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks!
1,"Highly effective anti-virus software.  Sometimes blocks good sites, but has a nice override.  It has been mentioned on Twit as a good alternative to other more expensive antivirus packages."
0,ok
1,"Norton 360 works great.  IT found over 8 viruses or malware in the first week.  I also love how it scans for more updates before every scan.

0,"I run a small company and wanted to use Quickbooks 2012 for Mac and TurboTax for Home and Busines Mac version but guess what, you can't export your company account information into TurboTax from Quickbooks for Mac because Quickbooks 2012 for Mac doesn't allow it, it only exports a list into an IIS file not the required TXF, Tax Exchange Format. What good is that and what good is an IIS file? And to add insult to injury, since I purchased a digital software download in March 2012 from Amazon, my first I might add, I am unable to get my money back for this garbage software because of the no return policy. Be sure to read the policy or you might be out like me.<br /><br />What good is an accounting program if you can't use it for your taxes. TurboTax either accepts the TXF file or you have to enter it by hand. Wow, I really wanted to enter everything by hand..... I am now going to hunt for ANY program to use in place of an intuit product. Come on, who does that, builds two products for the same platform from the same company that can't talk to each other. Positively, a terrible product. I think TurboTax is an okay product but I don't think the Mac version of Quickbooks should even be developed if it is going work like a boat anchor.<br /><br />My recommendation is to find a different product to place your trust in because it sure looks like Intuit is out to only make money selling a product but not a product that actually performs the functions that a small business would require. This is a worthless product that does not meet my needs and I am a dissatisfied customer who will not only avoid this product but any other software download from Amazon. I lost twice in this transaction.<br /><br />I would rather have used this review to praise the product instead of having to bash it. Look Intuit! I am a happy and satisfied customer! NOT!"
1,"I have used the Cook'n software for a number of years, and I just received version 10. Not only do I love the software, but I think the company is great, too. I contacted their support for an issue I thought I was having (I was mistaken), and the response was almost immediate. He explained what was happening and helped me to understand. I feel that the company has strong values and ethics. I appreciate dealing with people I can trust (in fact, they make me feel almost like part of the family). I would recommend this product and company to any of my friends."
1,I like the software download option as I don't have to worry about having the media with me when I want to install it on computers that are displaced in different locations.  I highly recommend this option and this vendor.  Everything has worked smoothly.
1,it is what you'd expect in an office 360 suit.
1,It seems to serve my needs.
1,Best tax software on the Mac.
1,I have been using this program for the last 4 years and do about 4 returns with it. I really like the guides for clothing and other items to charity.<br />My returns are quite simple but some issues like being a full time grad. student working in another state than your home. The help section was useless as to where you file.
0,"Have been a loyal Norton customer until I started using 360, kept getting error messages and after calling support several times never got it resolved.  Too much work!  Went with Webroot and I am very happy."
1,"I have been using Norton's network protection products for serveral years.  I have never had a computer virus during that period.  At one time Norton's products noticeably affected computer response, but newer versions perform their task without slowing my computer."
1,"very low consumption of PC resources, never had one infection using it 14 mos. Ive dumped a couple of other anti virus programs. I have 6 computers"
1,Easy to follow and in one day my taxes for both Fed and State were done. Have all your paperwork all together and it is that simple. Much simpler than the other software I have used. Easier to navigate.
1,"My kids absolutely love this program. I have too turn the computer off so I can get them to go play outside once in awhile, lol.<br />I see some people are having problems installing this with Norton's on there computer. I had the same issue and I contacted Core Learning, the maker of this product and they fixed me up right away. They told me this was a false positive (whatever that means) with Norton's and they assured me their software does not contain a virus. So happy with their support, and the response was quick."
0,There are viruses that will slow your computer less than Kaspersky. The price was right ($5) so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm pretty sure it has some kind of conflict with Chrome and slowed browsing to an absolute crawl. Uninstalled. Words can't express how much I hate Kaspersky.
1,"Norton's Internet Security is the best on the market, in my opinion."
1,"Read the reviews before I purchased this product, was concerned, there was some negative comments that it wouldn't load or work.  Purchased anyway and I didn't have any problems.  Great price would recommend."
0,"This product feels like a clunky add-on to Quicken. Barely useful. If you have only a few properties, I believe you would be better off with a custom spreadsheet. I am returning it.<br />For those who need to know how to return an electronic download, this is from Intuit's website:<br />For Quicken software downloaded from Amazon.com, uninstall Quicken and then send an e-mail request to ereturns@intuit.com or send a written request to Intuit Returns, PO Box 386, Greenville, SC 29334-0386.  Requests need to be received within 60 days of purchase.  Attach proof of purchase, such as the Your Order with Amazon.com confirmation e-mail. Refunds will be processed with a paper check within 3 - 4 weeks.  Please be sure your address is current."
0,"This software is good if you want to layer other than that its just not there, the editing and processing of the photos is slow and the edit view is poor, i would save your money and get light room unless you're looking for something for green screen edits."
0,"I've known many photographers many of whom use Photoshop but I personally cannot recall a single one of them ever saying, \\""I use Photoshop and love it.\\""  I have heard many comments about the user unfriendliness of these programs and the difficulty in learning them.  I'm sure Elements 10 has the ability to accomplish whatever tasks one desires in editing but after trying it I can only say that Photoshop has managed to take all the fun out of editing. It is mind numbingly tedious, laborious and boring.  I now see what so many people meant when Google decided to close Picnik and they said, \\""Please, Google, don't make me go back to Photoshop!\\"" They could accomplish the same results in a fraction of the time."
1,"My 12 year old son just loaded this on his laptop, vista. All went smoothly. He/we could not find the 3000 loops included. I called amazon and the lady was insistent that the code for the loop library was the same thing as the 3000 free loops included. Very frustrating. After a call to Sony, I was told to look for the sony folder on the computer. Sure enough, there were the files for the included loops, which still needed to be extracted. She said the amazon download sometimes does not load them automatically. The call was free even though it looks like there is another number for support which is for a fee.<br /><br />This hasn't been used yet to record. I was not going to involve myself in this project of my sons, however, after loading the loops, it looks like fun. We watched the tutorials and although we are just regular people with no background in recording/editing/songwriting, I think we will have fun making our own music. For 33.00, I think it is a great deal and a lot cheaper than some video games.<br /><br />I will update as soon as I hear the first song completed."
0,"Office 2013 professional is TERRIBLE!!!!  I was using it sort of okay when I first got it in July with increasing difficulties, for ex, would not load calendar items from Delta Airlines, meet ups, etc.<br /><br />Now it was completely stopped working.  I thought the problem might be that I still had Office 2007, which I uninstalled, and now I regret doing so because Office 2013 WILL NOT OPEN, WILL NOT REPAIR, AND I CAN'T ACCESS MY EMAIL, OUTLOOK APPOINTMENTS, SAVED EMAILS, ETC.  THIS IS A TOTAL DISPPOINTMENT AND ANNOYANCE.<br /><br />I CAN'T BELIEVE MICROSOFT PUT OUT SUCH A PIECE OF JUNK ON THE UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC.  DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE PRODUCT."
1,"I had Norton for 5 years. And it is reliable. It does not effect my computer to slow. I installed three computers and I bought another Norton Internet Security 2013 for my laptop. Norton 360 does very good job to catching virus. I have tried Trend, McAfee, and Kaspersky, but the Norton is the best so far. I will buy it again next year."
1,it is very easy to use and it is free<br />I am using it for few years and with out any problem
1,it is great. it  does what I need it to.easy to instal and very easy to use.cant ask for more.
1,Best Anti Virus Software out there.
1,"I have used the various iterations of the H&R Block tax software for several years now. The user interface is clean and clear, no &#34;pizzazz&#34; but very straightforward, just like a good H&R Block tax consultant would be. The questions lead you through all that's needed to complete your return. I have been totally satisfied with the product.<br /><br />You can get it as a CD-ROM or download it directly. The download on my DSL Internet connection took a few minutes, and worked fine from the get-go. You get the key for opening the program via email. This particular program covers both Federal and one state tax preparation. You will have to pay extra if you have more than one state in which to file. Also, there is an extra cost for filing the state taxes online.<br /><br />After you finish the taxes, it reviews it and finds anything that doesn't look just right. In some cases, it just asks you to double-check to make sure you entered the information correctly. Then it allows you to file the Federal taxes by e-File, which is very easy. I found the state e-File to be too expensive to make it worth it. You can also print out all the necessary forms for the state taxes and snail mail it.<br /><br />The Deluxe version is good for most average taxpayers to use. It covers regular income/expenses, investments and small business issues. If you have rental property or complicated investments, you will need to upgrade to the Premium version.<br /><br />I'm not a CPA, nor a tax expert. But I would recommend this software as an easy, and inexpensive, way to accurately determine and file your yearly taxes."
1,Quickbooks is a great tool for sending and getting paid for invoices.  The interface is beautiful and very easy to use.  Best account software we've used thus far and we've tried them all.
0,"Beware, this software is constantly checking to make sure you own in. This can be a problem. I have a legitimate copy on my laptop. I had not used it for a while. I got on an airplane and Word refused to function because it could not call home (i.e., verify the software).  The trip was rushed so I had planned to do some important work in-flight. I had to work late into the night in my room because of this issue. Contacted MS support and got a few generalized e-mails but they never addressed the problem then they stopped. Based on this, I cannot recommend the 365 version of Office. (I got this through my University not via Amazon). UPDATE:  I finally got an answer, you have to use Office at least 1 time each month so that it can verify your copy. Not a problem i guess, unless, like me, your laptop sits unused most of the time. 2nd Update This can still bite you on the butt.  Just pulled out my laptop and ran to a meeting. Been a few weeks since I used this unit.  The WI-FI was down and I could not pull up my data because it was a new month!!! This is just stupid. It's my software!!! UPDATE - I have 365 running on two work computers.  I purchased a Surface Pro 4 for home.  When the 365 subscription on the surface ended I purchased another year from Costco.  I tried entering the Product Key but the installer required me to log on to my Microsoft account. It then proceeded to apply the renewal to one of my work computers.  So far the only way I have been able to get Office 365 working on my Surface Pro has been to deactivate the installation on my work lap top.  OK, you're right. I was stupid to buy 365 again!"
1,"Great price ONLY at Amazon!! I could barely believe my eyes on the price for Norton Internet Security could not buy it fast enough! I can't speak for anyone else but I myself stand by Norton Internet Security to keep my PC clean and running smoothly. I have tried many others but nothing compares to the security and price (Best pricing at Amazon), outstanding!!"
1,Great so far!!!
1,Great software. Versatile and user friendly.  Easy learning curve; takes about two hours to become proficient.  I highly recommend it.
1,this was just an &#34;upgrade&#34;...I have been using quicken for probably 10 years...it is an excellent tracking and reconciling tool for your banking needs.
1,I really like Quicken for my personal and farm money managing.  I have been using (Intuit programs) Quickbooks and Quicken for 20 years.  I have owned a few businesses and have used the programs for each one.  I would like it to be less expensive to upgrade and continue to use when I have been a customer so long.
0,"I like the (potential) convenience of Amazon cloud, but this product is awful and USELESS. I would like to have a folder on my computer where I store my photos, synchronize them with the cloud, then being able to synchronize them with my other laptops and desktops and eventually access them with tablets and phone. This was exactly what the previous version could do. The new one has a lame interface where one can drop files, to upload them to the cloud. No synchronization, no folder selection, even no pictures folder. Hello, Amazon geeks and marketeers - we are not all mindless users who just dump their files on your cloud. Either create a versatile intelligent interface option or face the large competition. Duh!"
1,Great
0,"I purchased Enhanced Payroll thinking it would be a straight forward upgrade as it had been it the past ... wrong. They've come up with yet another way to extract more money.<br /><br />First, you cannot find the expiration date of your current subscription without contacting support which is a time consuming process. Second you cannot add your newly purchased subscription until the current one expires nor without contacting support. When you contact support, they explain that there will be an additional $2 per employee per month fee beyond your payroll purchase price. Oh yeah, you get one employee without charge ... big whoop. To activate your subscription you must DELETE your current authorization to add the new one, and this will not process unless you enter credit card info. After all, they're intending to bill you additional fees!!<br /><br />This is a greedy, greedy company. They force you to regularly buy new versions of QuickBooks by having the shortest support period of any software company (two years). These updates are often initially buggy and typically add no additional value. Now they are adding sneaky fees ... yes, it's sort of mentioned in very small print on the back of the box.<br /><br />I think the time is ripe for a company that's more customer oriented to aggressively move into this market."
0,"I have an old copy of Microsoft 2002 and have been wanting to upgrade for years. I looked into the possibility of upgrading recently, but I read somewhere that your purchase is only good for one license on one PC, regardless of the length of time your PC lasts. Imagine the surprise encountered whenever a new customer decided to upgrade their PC or by anyone who experienced a hardware failure. I couldn't believe such a ridiculous policy applied to the general public. It might make sense for a business or corporate license, but the `average Joe' isn't going to read through licensing policies and legal jargon before buying an Office software package for home use. It seemed obvious to me at that point that Microsoft was trying to capitalize on the trust of the common home user, at the expense of their hard earned income. This severely damaged whatever trust I had for the company.<br /><br />Fast-forward to just yesterday, when I decided to review my options, and I discovered Microsoft amended their policy to allow users to transfer their license from one computer to the next, provided the license is only active on one PC at a time. Great, I figured! So I proceeded to purchase the software, thinking Microsoft again had the customer's interests in mind.<br /><br />I received the purchase confirmation email, clicked the URL provided, clicked the \\""Get Started\\"" button on the Microsoft website, and it brought me to a Microsoft login screen. Apparently you have to create a Microsoft account in order to even access your software. Not a big deal or even an uncommon practice these days, but during the account creation process, if you inadvertently select the wrong birth date, you're denied access to the software you purchase unless you provide Microsoft with credit card information. No big deal, I thought. I figured there must be an alternative method for confirming your age, to gain access to your Microsoft account, to in turn access your software purchase. What a headache...<br/><br />So the first thing I did was poke around on the Microsoft website until I stumbled across a Microsoft live chat support link. I don't recall if I found it directly from Google or from Microsoft, but I'm certain it was a Microsoft support representative. I explained that I couldn't log in my account to access my software, which cost me $139.00, because Microsoft was demanding I provide credit card information to verify my age. \\""How could I have purchased the software online with a credit in the first place if I weren't an adult,\\"" I asked. I offered to forward the email confirmation from Amazon, purchase order details, and even offered my license number as an alternative method for age verification. The Microsoft support representative ultimately told me they couldn't assist me, and referred me back to Amazon to request a refund. What a waste of time, I thought. I went back to Amazon and explained the issue to not one, not two, but three different Amazon representatives.<br /><br />In fairness, I'd like to pause here for a moment and say that each Amazon representative made an honest attempt at assisting me with my problem, and I've never had a negative experience with Amazon. Their support is still fantastic in my opinion.<br /><br />The second Amazon representative with whom I spoke gave me step-by-step instructions on how to get in touch with a Microsoft support representative by phone, but the final step in the instruction guide, 'Click the \\""Request a call button,\\""' brought me right back to the Microsoft login screen. Each time I'd try to login the Microsoft account, however, it would simply demand credit card information again. So in order to reach the support I needed, I had to have access to my newly created Microsoft account, but in order to have access to my account, I needed to speak to support about an alternative method for age verification. It was a frustrating catch-22; a paradoxical situation from which I couldn't escape because of contradictory rules.<br /><br />Any company (e.g., Microsoft Corp.) that places its bottom line above the convenience and satisfaction of its customers is in general not one I'm particularly comfortable trusting with my credit card information, but it wasn't even a matter of trust so much as a matter of principle. Let's look at it from another perspective: If someone were to purchase something from me, then after the monetary transaction occurred, I demand their credit card information before giving them the item they already paid for, that person would no doubt feel outraged by my lack of ethical competance. Microsoft being a large corporation doesn't change that sentiment one bit.<br /><br />So I went back to Amazon support, and finally I simply requested a refund for my purchase, since I wasn't able to access the software I purchased. Unfortunately, Amazon explained, because I clicked the URL in the email, the software license was already tied to the account I created at Microsoft, despite the fact that I wasn't able to access it. Thus, they were unable to offer a refund. This was very frustrating but ultimately understandable given the circumstances.<br /><br />As an alternative, I was given a 1-800 number for direct communication with Microsoft support. I called their support and followed the automated guidance to navigate to the correct department, Accounts and Registration. Upon arriving to the correct department, the automated message instructed me to hang up the phone and access the Accounts department from the website, and it proceeded to hang up on me. By this time I had already spent well over 3 hours trying to troubleshoot this issue. The only thing I wanted was to get in touch with a real Microsoft representative via the phone so I could explain my problem. \\""Surely, they must offer an alternative means for age verification,\\"" I thought.<br /><br />I called Microsoft's 1-800 number again, this time choosing the SALES department, figuring they wouldn't hang up on meagain if they thought they might be in a position to make more money. Fortunately [sad as it may be], my strategy worked and I was able to reach a real live representative. I explained my problem and they in turn explained that there was no way they could assist me in accessing my account over the phone. Despite the fact that I was talking to them in person and they could clearly hear that I wasn't a child, they still demanded credit card information. At one point the representative suggested they might be able to refund my purchase through their \\""money-back guarantee program,\\"" but after being placed on hold several times, they returned only to explain that since I couldn't prove the software was defective or not functioning properly, I wasn't eligible for a refund. So alas, I was once again back where I started. It turned out my only options were to snail mail my personal information or provide it to them in the form of credit card information online.<br /><br />If Microsoft truly had its customer's interests at heart, they would offer an alternative means for age verification. Having been a victim of credit fraud for 8 years during my early adult life, and without the financial means to hire a lawyer to fight it, I've become understandably cautious when it comes to providing my credit card information. I feel like I've been taken advantage of by a company that clearly concerns itself more with its bottom line than the satisfaction and convenience of its paying customers. This coupled with the fact that they apparently don't offer much if any support for customers who've already purchased their software licenses leaves me convinced that despite its reputable history and considerable market influence, it is not a company worthy of the trust it receives. I gave the software 2 stars, because the software itself isn't bad, but it lost 3 stars because dealing with Microsoft has easily been one of the most frustrating and absurdly ridiculous experiences of my life.<br /><br />Finally, I'll conclude by just stating my intent here is not so much to express my frustration for Microsoft and the recent experience I've had dealing with its [lack of] customer support and effective policies, but rather primarily to give others considering this purchase additional information they might use to make a more informed purchase decision."
1,A nice upgrade from free options like paint.net. The layout is nice and the tools are more precise and intelligent in finding boarders.  I mostly just do basic edits and it has what I need and was on sale.
1,The upgrade from '14 was smooth & easy.  The screens are a bit more crisp and the free credit score alone pays for itself (at least in my case).
1,Very good product
0,"I got to use this for a day.  I got all my information plugged and my accounts all set up.  Then it had to install an update.  Now, it doesn't even open.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it three times.  Nothing works.  Amazon is not able to give a refund for this product so I had to contact Intuit for a refund.  It's been a week and I haven't heard back from them.  Looks like I just got ripped off.  Do not recommend this product."
0,"I join the ranks of folks who were perfectly happy with their older version of Quicken - 2011 in my case - who was &#34;forced&#34; to upgrade in order to keep my support.  Ironically I never needed support because 2011 &#34;just worked&#34; every time.  No so for 2014.  The download from Amazon was way out of date.  After several painful, scary hours I figured out there was an update to the release (R5 at the time) and things were much better after I installed that.  Much better, however, was still not very good.<br /><br />At this point I'm on R6 and will stay there for a while.  There are still scary moments - like I accept all the downloaded transactions, click &#34;done&#34; and nothing happens.  Then some time later when I come back to that account those transactions _have_ been accepted, there are a couple more which automagically get accepted and things &#34;seem&#34; to be fine.<br /><br />The scary part is - what's going wrong that I can't tell... yet...<br /><br />So if I were in my original shoes (2011) I'd certainly wait until the last possible moment to &#34;upgrade&#34;, and I might look around for, say, 2013 which is presumably stable by now :-)<br />If you do use it and need to contact support, call them and stay on the line.  DO NOT wait for the &#34;escalation&#34; process to get back to you - my experience is that was useless.  The support engineers are friendly and methodical but they're dealing with substandard product.<br /><br />I have been a heavy user of Quicken since 2004 and I've never seen anything approaching this mess.<br /><br />If this weren't such a &#34;sticky application&#34; (application you can't easily move away from) we'd all be gone.<br /><br />Something has gone seriously wrong in their development process.  Hopefully the company has learned a lesson and is fixing the product AND their process."
1,Very fast service! Easy to fill out!
1,"Just what I needed to keep my recipe collection together in an easily accessible format. I have been using &#34;Cook&#34;n&#34; now for about 1 year. I had several file folders of printed recipes I had  accumulated over the years. It was very easy to scan them and place them in Cook&#34;n. Also finding recipes on the internet and adding them to Cook&#34;n is easy-peasy.<br />This software makes it easy to copy and paste from scanned pages. It's also easy to pull in recipes from Pinterest, Food Network, About, etc. I really love this program!"
0,"Since I purchased Quickbooks, I have encountered an incredible amount of fees. I would encourage anyone buying it to really do the research.  There isn't enough included with the software to do much with without having to upgrade it and pay more fees.  Support wait times are also very long if you happen to need help.  When the software withdraws from your account, it has a very long delay and only part of the transaction goes through, which also helps in throwing off your checking account balance. Also, if you are unfortunate enough to have a NSF, they will charge you $100 per transaction no matter how small the transaction is in addition to what your bank charges you. Research this product thoroughly before purchasing. If I could return this product and receive a refund, I absolutely would."

1,"We use QuickBooks including QuickBooks payroll.  We have two different companies, one is real estate management and one is health and nutrition services.  QuickBooks works great for both.  The payroll software makes it much easier to have employees than the old days when you had to keep up with all the tax updates yourself.  We find all the QuickBooks products easy to use."
0,"Less than one week ago, I switched from Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 to Norton 360 Ver 6. Although I like the product a great deal, they have one major problem which they cannot resolve. Windows 7 reports:<br /><br />1. My Anti-Virus is Not working<br />2. My Norton 360 Firewall is not working<br />3. My Norton Anti-Spyware is not working<br /><br />Meanwhile Norton 360 reports everything is working but Windows has these 3 major errors in bold red which worries me.<br /><br />This has happened 3 times in less than a week. Each time I go to Norton Tech Support, the technician does an excellent job and tells me the problem will not return. And guess what, the next time Live Update runs and I reboot the machine, the problem returns. I've never seen anything like this before and don't understand why Norton cannot permanently correct the issue.<br /><br />If they can fix this issue, I would rate the software very high. But until then, I have to give it a low grade. I'll report back soon."

1,I have been using WordPerfect since when it dominated the market.  At that time it was known for the best Customer Support of any software program.<br />  When I saw that it now contains a Presentation package I bought it.  I have not been disappointed.<br />  In just a week I have become comfortable using it.  I have just finished a 33 screen presentation for a class that I am teaching.  In that time I have learned how to access almost all of the functions that I require.<br />  I have been using Power Point and more recently the Libre Office presentation package.  I I have about six more presentations to prepare on how to use Ancestral Quest.  I plan to use WordPerfect's Presentations to prepare all of them.<br />  My only complaint is that it must be a monster program because it required so long to download it into my computer.

1,"After reading some of the earlier, negative reviews, I was really not sure I wanted to bother with the new version. But...so far, Quicken 2013 has worked just fine. Easy set-up, easy updates, and the mobile app has worked fine. My last version was 2011, and I would take 2013 any day over that."

0,"Been a quicken user since 1996 so I have a significant amount of history in this application..<br /><br />Last time I upgraded was to 2012. Tried upgrading to 2013 without a hitch. Data was converted to the new format..<br /><br />Unfortunately data entry is... Slow.. Horribly slow.. The application is not responsive at all.. Downloaded all of the patches.. Still do not notice a difference in performance..<br /><br />I'm currently running the windows version of Quicken on an I7-2600K desktop with 16 GB of Ram...<br /><br />So I really don't expect applications to run slow on my desktop.. Unfortunately Quicken 2013 performs like each transaction is a pain to record. Like it is searching for something.<br /><br />Application Prompts stay on the screen for extended periods, sometime requiring responses to be recorded multiple times.<br />The Reconcile Screen, works best when you use a mouse to mark transaction as reconciled. If I use the keyboard and space bar, the application response slows considerably.. Counter intuitive as most applications perform better when using short cuts rather then the mouse.<br /><br />Tried the iPad application which is supposed to support data sharing between desktop and ipad.. Wasn't happy that my budgets setup on my desktop were not currently supported..<br /><br />May switch to Mint, (same company) as this web-app may be the best alternative at this time.. Hope Quicken gets its act together soon as the application options are slim in this area..<br /><br />Updated: Restarted my process by recreating a file from scratch. Application runs a lot quicker. Apparently the issue is that it doesn't perform well with a lot of data. The common thread is that a lot of the frustrated users are long time users with history. I don't use the product as much as I did prior although I still use it for balancing my checkbook."
1,"Great price, and it was exactly what I was after.  Available instantly, couldn't get it any faster or cheaper anywhere."
1,I can't stop using it!
0,"I've used WORD in many versions for years.  I only bought this to load a new PC we just bought for a business.  You would not BELIEVE how much TROUBLE they put me through to install and register this program.  It was a real nightmare (the Microsoft side, not the Amazon side).<br /><br />Further, I do not like the look and feel of WORD 2013 which is much more complex than it needs to be.  I wish I could just use my old 2003 version again.<br /><br />So, I'm up and running finally, but the only reason I bought this is to be compatible with other folks.  Otherwise it is a waste."
0,"Maybe I just don't know post processing software that well, but this software doesn't impress me.  It seems to have a very small set of plugins, free or otherwise.  Lightroom seems to abound with plugins.  No HDR.  The best part is lens correction."
0,"This product is useless and does not work with previous Family Tree products,<br />If you liked the original Family Tree for Windows you will not like the layout and entree<br />modes of this product,  which resembles the old Roots program.<br />The download as with all Amazon downloads is not refundable.<br /><br />So do not waste your money at Amazon.<br /> There are other sites available that have grace periods for software that allow<br />for a trial period."
0,if i could give a negative rating i would do it. crashes continuously. will not sync accounts.  nothing good to say
0,"Weird Al once released a song called &#34;Trapped in a Closet with Vanna White.&#34; I feel as if I have been trapped in a closet with Intuit Quickbooks for more than a decade! Here's yet another iteration of bloatware, that does too much in order to make it as widely useful to too many people, while at the same time managing to continue to waste your screen space and time with advertising for checks, payment processing, payroll solutions, etc... As if I don't get enough of those solicitations in phone calls throughout the course of a business day.<br /><br />Maybe someday Intuit will release a version of QB that you can chop down into the specialized use that you want, and will remove its advertising from the main screen. Until then I will continue to look for an escape from this Quickbooks trap, that I don't have time to replace as of yet."
1,I'm never disappointed with this product.  I had someone call me over and over with questions from a competitors product this year.  I told them to switch and quit wasting their time!!!
1,"I had one problem, but a reinstall and reboot solved it.<br />The security DB failed to initialize."
0,The transition to garmin was terrible---i lost the map---now i can't get it back--i have no idea whats going on. seamless it's not. I cdan't get any resolution from either garmin or amazon since it's a weekend. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
1,I use TurboTax every year to do my taxes - I could do (and have done) my taxes by hand but my time is worth too much to me to do that every year.  Turbo tax is easy to use and I love how it saves my information from year to year.
1,"For you Mac users out there, how does Quicken 2013 work with Parallels.<br />I'm wanting to upgrade from my 2008 version, but reluctant due to mixed<br />reviews on this product.[[ASIN:B008S0IE5M Quicken Home & Business 2013 [Download]]]"
1,Every bit as easy to use as the old TT deluxe and at less money.
1,Saved a lot of money over Norton website.  used Norton for 3 years - pleased with Norton Internet Security 2013 - especially the money.  Works like Norton 2012.
0,iBank5 periodically corrupts the file such that all or part of my data disappear.  Thus far tech support has not provided a logical reason for this occurrence.  Very frustrating.
0,"I'm a long time Turbo Tax user, but decided to try H&R again.  I'm annoyed at the way TT periodically tries to &#34;upsale&#34; within the app, and the price increase.  However to be blunt, I feel TT is better quality software.  H&R crashed once, causing me to lose work.  When entering charity donations, H&R doesn't provide a way to edit Deductable Pro entries.  You can't combine custom entries with the DP-generated entries (like TT's ItsDeductable).  I saw a couple of other quirks, such as a limit of 4 child care providers.  Adding a 5th squishes preexisting entries without informing the user.  In short, I feel H&R isn't on the same usability and quality level as TT."
0,"This program uses way too much approximation and back and forth to make it worthwhile for anything more than roughing out area uses and floorplans.  After numerous tries, the roof never did come out as planned.  There is also no built-in undo provision if you happen to hit the wrong key or find the program misinterprets what you want it to do.  Wait 'til you try to locate various points along an opening (invisible wall) since you cannot read or set dimensions when doing so."
0,"since I have purchased this program it has locked my computer up twice, both times I have called quicken I have been transferred too people whose speech was so broken that I could barley understand it  The next thing they start a sales pitch too sell you a program, the only way I can unlock my computer is unplug it  I have had quicken products since 2010 ,this is also putting popups in on A regular basis  thank you  C R Wynn"
0,it wasnt the one I was looking for... I will keep looking for the one I want..its very slow. sorry
1,"First of all this is great and free! Not as fancy as MS but, works just as well and fits my needs. give this a try and see for yourself! I just saved myself over $100 bucks! Thanks!"
0,"I found by using Driver Booster to install an audio driver,I lost streaming audio on the internet.<br />I don't recommend this driver software."
1,"Haven't had a chance to use all the updated features, but like the look and feel. Pretty easy to enter checks and get to my reports for tax reporting purposes."
0,"I ordered a download Quicken Essentials for MAC!  A Review of Purchases shows that I own it.  When I click on &#34;download&#34; it seems to move an icon to the Hard Drive.  However, it is not there.<br /><br />The reason I specified MAC! is because it tells me I have to check the Amazon Games & Software Library.  A click there tells me I need to download it, but it not for MAC! only for Windows.<br /><br />Either:<br />1. Tell me how to download the program; or<br />2. Tell me how to get the cost credited back to my AmEx card.<br /><br />The disgusting thing is that I had a perfectly good, working Quicken 2003 that I had since new but when I upgraded from OS 10.6.8 to OS 10.9.2 it is not supported.<br /><br />I should have gone to a store and bought the disc version."
1,"I have been using Quickbooks since 2012 and I am very happy with the software.  I use it for accounts payable ,general ledger, bank reconcilations, 1099's .  Makes my life easier so I can focus on running my business"
1,"I've been using Norton's 360 for a year now, it does such a great job of protecting my computer and keeping it tuned up and running great that I renewed my subscription for another year..<br />I use to use several other programs to do this job but with Norton's doing it all I got rid of all the other programs.<br />Thanks Norton !"
0,Don't like it nearly as much as Home Publishing by Microsoft.  This one is more complicated to use.
1,Had to unsync my accounts and wait a couple days to setup the online data transfer again.  Not sure if it was Quicken or my bank but it was very coincidental that it happened right after I upgraded.  I do love the Quicken software!
1,I have used Quicken for longer than I can remember. A new feature this year is the Portfolio XRay. I manage our investments and make my own decisions on buy/sell. This Xray allows me to fully examine my investments and allows for better balancing of the portfolio.
0,"Norton 360 installed fine as upgrade, but the final result still showed the old expiration date. In other words it di not take.<br /><br />Amazon help was anything but helpful. After a string of &#34;security questions&#34; (collecting information that amazon could then SELL), we got stuck at my refusing to provide information that they did not yet have - my address. How can the answer to information they do not have be a security question?!<br /><br />I'm done with Amazon. The cost of time trying to get help from them far exceeds the savings one might get, on the off chance, that the product actually works."
0,"I have mixed feelings.  I miss some of the old easy features.  I could reconcile everything with just two clicks , now I have to search and seek for freatures to get what I need.  No real instruction, just figure it out!  If I had not paid for the system I would return to the older system even though Quicken will nolonger support the older version.  What the hell do I need the sync for I do not do on phone banking, its just shoved down your throat.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk"
0,Ruined my computer. Spent three hours restoring my computer. Do not buy!!!!!!
1,"Been a Quicken user for years. Have tried Mint a few times, but it still (and probably always will) lacks some key features I want. Couple of things stand out to me with Quicken 2013:<br /><br />- Update was flawless and my old data was imported without any hitches<br />- Most of my account login info transferred with no issues, but I had to go back in and re-set some. My accounts with PFCU still won't download, but I haven't dug into it.<br />- The annoying extra step of telling Quicken to download all transactions after you log into your PWD vault is gone. Now, after you log into the PWD vault upon startup, it just does a download (THANK YOU!)<br />- Noticed that in my Windows 7 program list, there is no icon for Quicken 2013, although on my Desktop there is.<br /><br />I can't comment much more than that. I'm not a budgeter and I've not set up the online cloud stuff, although my backups to the cloud are pretty quick.<br />Do I think it's bogus that they make you buy a new version every two years now, yes. Does the upgrade seem worth it so far? No. But then, I don't do a whole lot of banking from my mobile device right now. If that changes, the new features might very well be worth it."
1,"A great product, but I purchased it because the Basic version was no longer available.  While it did everything that I needed, it offered much more than I actually needed.  My home is paid for and my wife gets one 1099 and I get two, with some various interest statements, so our return is fairly easy.  While the Deluxe model handled that with ease, I felt that it was overkill for our return.  The Basic version would have been adequate for me.  Just my thoughts...."
1,Worked
0,"I have been using Quicken Products to manage my finances since the early 2000's. I have never had the problems like I have had with Quicken Premier 2015. (I have been using premier since mid 2000's.) I have spent more than 75 hours since December 2014, when I purchased this product, on chat or their phone tech support trying to get this program to work properly. The one step update consistently tells me it cannot find my accounts, which are clearly listed on the account bar, then goes through a process to reset the accounts that takes forever and never fixes anything. The program is very glitchy. You have to have a password and login to their website to be able to even use the product, which is highly inconvenient. I can say I used to recommend this product and I not only cannot recommend it, but I am looking for a financial management program."
0,I did not find many things that I could not get for free from the internet like Picca or that came with my camera in this software.
1,"WOW, what a great deal and it does much more than the current Deluxe version of Turbo Tax.  It also will read your old Turbo Tax data file and import the information.  I will probably not consider buying Turbo Tax again unless H&R Block gets greedy and starts asking for more money for the same functionality currently provided.<br /><br />It is very easy to use!  I would definitely recommend current Turbo Tax users give this a try!"
0,"Had previously used tax experts to understand a problematic number on my return and they were very helpful.  However, this year I got a letter from the IRS about my 2012 return.  I called their tax expert service again to help understand the differing numbers, but this time the person was totally unhelpful and rude and told me that they do not review tax returns.  If they don't do that, then what do they do?  I was able to eventually track down the problem myself, but it was with absolutely NO help from TurboTax AT ALL!  I seriously feel that their claims about 100% accurate calculations, support for audits and IRS conflicts, and tax calculation refunds are not to be trusted at this point."
0,"I have faithfully upgraded to new versions of Quicken whenever they became available.  In the past, I have always responded to email upgrade via announcements from Intuit.  I tried several times via Intuit but kept encountering problems.  Ultimately, I opted to upgrade via Amazon.com and was relieved that the download and upgrade went smoothly.  Earlier this year, I had problems getting TurboTax (another Intuit product) to accept a state deduction of my National Guard retirement as per several previous years.  Consequently, next year I will be shopping on Amazon for a replacement.  I no longer have confidence in Intuit.com.  The previous version of Quicken met my needs; the mobile capability didn't interest me.  But I was stunned that they'd push upgrades through their website that, this year, they couldn't support to past levels, especially since this upgrade didn't seem that much different.  The effect is I am left more confident in Amazon.com's download offerings and less confident in Intuit.  Just my humble opinion as a long-time Quicken-TurboTax user."
0,I do not like the new version of Microsoft Office I prefer the Office 2010 because it is easier to use.  This was a waste of money.
0,"Basically, this is similar to Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 Windows version. Since I find DNS 13 Windows version drastically improved over DNS 12 (small improvement in terms of accuracy, big improvement in terms of adaptability/convenience), I was quite shocked to find that Nuance is still selling this outdated version for the Mac. I cannot go back to this version after using DNS 13 Windows version.<br /><br />In fact, I found that Parallels Desktop (Windows virtual machine) + DNS 13 is way much better than Dragon Dictate 4. (I use MBP retina display 15 inch + 16GB ram, so my VM can have enough RAM + cpu cores; it works very smoothly, if not faster than a desktop).<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you are really desperate. You'd better wait until the next version comes out."
0,Runs slower than previous version. Screen flickers and updates slowly. Pretty much feel like a victim of extortion since I was forced to upgrade or lose the ability to automatically update my accounts.  This is they type of products we get when a company cares more about profit than their customers.
1,"Very useful application with only a few quirks. I had to call support to figure out how to change its default spelling of two words, both names, as my legal name is &#34;Bryan&#34; (not Brian) and my girlfriend's legal name is &#34;Christy&#34; (not Christine) and it sometimes mistakes other phrases, such as &#34;What's up?&#34; for &#34;Wakeup&#34; (the command to come out of sleep mode)<br /><br />Other than those minor irritations, I have found this app invaluable as a much faster, and more accurate, alternative to trying to type with my one usable hand. Emails that used to take 30 minutes to type are now accurately dictated in five to ten minutes. Works with every app I have tried to dictate into, from Textedit and Pages to Safari and Numbers.<br /><br />I have already recommended this app, or its Windows based version, to three friends who also type with one hand. EVERY slow or impaired typist should buy this application! The time savings alone more than makes up for the cost."
1,Very happy with that.
1,good product.  works as advertised
1,I keep all my tax forms with turbotax because the ease or the product and keeps my state file up to date
1,"since sliced bread.  Why can't everything be this great?  I changed all of my computers to this office suite.  It opens all windows documents and open source stuff.  Many more tools than the other programs that you have to pay for, which i don't understand. Seems to run faster which i attribute to no bloat in the programming.  I am running windows 7 and this works great."
1,"Thank you for providing an electronic way to save my hard earned $$.  It had to be updated once installed (another long download), but that also was a very fair trade off."
0,"After installing it is asking me to enter a serial number and I do not have a serial number. Not able to use, one sad child who was looking forward to reading with Caillou here."
1,"Not too much to say about Microsoft Office - everyone knows what it is.  But I CAN say that I found the Amazon download and installation process seamless.  Download the small app, let it get the software, and then add the product key.  Simple.  Plus, the price I paid here was equal to or less than anywhere else.  Moral of the story:  If Amazon has it, I don't need to look any place else."
1,Worked fine.
1,"I have been using one version or another of QuickBooks for over 10 years.  I have found it a very easy program to navigate, and the ease of entry is amazing.  For a novice or a beginner, QuickBooks is a great program for keeping up with your personal or business finances!  It will create professional looking reports, and the newest innovations in data sharing technologies--using numerous programs together with QuickBooks is great!"
1,This works OK. It keeps our computers tuned up and backed up with no effort on our part. No complaints.
1,Great product. I had been using an Accountants software for the last 12 years. I was very happy I didn't have to go through all the questions.<br />Will buy again next year.
1,"It is easily downloaded and installed in minutes from Amazon.  Norton does a great job of stopping threats, but tends to slow down your computer quite a bit...several of my friends say the same thing."
1,"I have been using Quicken deluxe 2009 for Windows and like it a lot. Since I could not export my data to Quicken 2015 for MAC, I had to start from scratch. Quicken 2015 for MAC seems to be very intuitive and is easy to learn. The tutorials help a lot. And compared to Quicken deluxe 2009 for Windows it offers a lot more features."
0,"NOT Amazon's problem. Intuit screwed up and has admitted as such. In previous years, this version contained the most basic business Schedule C and two other business forms. Without warning Intuit removed them. DO NOT PURCHASE this version if you have any business expenses. Again. DO NOT PURCHASE this version. If you do accidentally purchase this version and need a Schedule C, go to Intuit's site, do an upgrade to Home & Business, then follow the procedures to get a $25 rebate for the trouble for being forced to upgrade because of their unannounced change to their product.  Schedule C business issue aside, Turbo Tax continues to be, what I believe a superb product. I have used it without issue for years."
0,Im not sure its necessarily better than Windows but it is nice to have a choice.
0,"I was happily using Quicken Deluxe 2010 and did not want to switch to Quicken 2015 but was forced to switch in order to use Intuit's 2014 TurboTax.  I believe this was a cheap trick by Intuit to force us to upgrade to Quicken 2015.  The next time I am required to upgrade Quicken to use TuboTax, I will be switching to a new tax program and will no longer use TurboTax.<br /> I see no difference between Quicken Deluxe 2010 and 2015."
1,"I love Quicken and have been using it for almost 20 years. I use it on a Virtual Machine: Win XP in Parallels on a MacBook Pro. Had a few problems with registration, but a call to Parallels support (and a clean up of old programs and registry) resulted in a good product install."
0,Should have known that &#34;Free&#34; equals other spam applications loaded with it.
1,I've used WordPerfect since 5.0 and with each new version is just gets better. I would recommend this suite to anyone who wants an easy to use and powerful office suite.
0,I just purchased H&R Block Federal & State 2014 at Amazon. I downloaded the software but I'm now being asked for an activation code. I didn't see one in the email receipt from Amazon. I've been waiting for a H&R Block Live Chat response for 3 hours now.
0,"Product Key supplied by Amazon does not work. MS refuse to support it as their website says this is an international key and I am located in the US. Downloaded today, whilst in the US, I am a US citizen"
0,"Do Not Waste Your Money.  Unfortunately, I rarely post reviews on products, but this one warrants it.  I am computer literate and an engineer and this program is a complete waste.  It will not allow you to delete (or go back) when you make a mistake.  And, worse yet, it will move a wall point arbitraily and completely ruin the design.  I feel like I just threw away $20.  Despite the other reviews, I thought with my computer knowledge I could make it work - but I was wrong.  After 8 hours of trying...I give up."
1,"I have used TT for the past 7 or 8 years. It imports prior years info, which is a huge timesaver. Alot of friends use free online tax tools, which I respond to them: Who is profiting from your information you are providing?"
1,"it seems like a hell of a lot of money for this program, and i needed to enter an unbelievably small amount of information due to the size (and gross receipts) of my company.  BUT...try doing this by hand and you'll see why it's worth the money."
1,GOOD
1,found it easy to enter information and tenant payments. I like the all-in-one screen design to view it all at once and the size of print is readable.  Reports generated from this ap can be customized just they way i want them to be.  This is so helpful and easy to use.  My accountant loves how prepared i am at the end of the year.
1,"Avast  not only works great , it finds virus activity other Antivirus software packages miss. All other AV packages I have used are less dependable."
1,I've using taxcut for many years. It's very smooth to do tax return start from previous year return and import data from a money manager SW such as MS Money or Quicken. So there is no question or problem of SW itself. What I'd like to comment is buy it from Amazon is easy and cheap than from retail. Amazon SW download is easy to use and fast (given you have good internet connection).
1,I've used this product to do my taxes for the past 10 years<br />and have never been disappointed. It steps you through<br />every phase of your financial life and helps you locate<br />every possible deduction. Very easy to use and takes<br />most of the pain out of doing your taxes.
1,"I have used Avast! for years without fail.  I highly recommend this version, and all Avast! products.  I like this version because it is more user friendly, and interactive.  Use Avast!, you won't be disappointed."
1,It's free and it doesn't consume resources.It's the perfect combination. I didn't had problems with viruses since i used it.
1,I am having some issues with balancing my accounts but i am liking all of the features
1,"Last year, when our church became incorporated as a non-for-profit corporation, I searched for ways to keep the records of our church funds.  It takes a while to learn how to use QuickBooks but the help section and their technical support staff can simplify the process.  I like it!"
0,"Had high hopes, but all I get is &#34;Cannot connect to cloud drive&#34; and there is absolutely no help online.  Dumping this...if the basic client cannot even work, then why would I put my digital life in your hands? I had planned to migrate, but we'll wait now."
1,GREAT!
0,I tried to open the program.  It did not open.  I allowed 30 minutes.  I uninstalled and reinstalled it.  It does not open.  I am using a new computer.  You owe me a refund.  How do I get my refund?
1,Because Its good It does what it's supposed to do Keeps my computer clean Would recommend it to anybody Good product
1,"I have been using Quicken since the days of DOS. Most every year I upgraded to the latest version. Last year I was happy to see a app. Though it does not show investments, it is good. I do not see a need to enter investment transactions on the app, showing balances would be nice. I admit syncing can be slow and I get lots of \\""Not Responding\\"" messages but it does get the job done. As far as the program goes I think it is great. It does everything I want and need it to do. I have not checked out any of the enhancements yet but I am getting ready to. If their are any bugs I am sure Intuit will fix as soon as they can. I don't think they are in the habit of putting out junk or software with serious issues."
1,"I've been using Quicken H&B for years now.  This version actually eliminated a couple of annoying problems I had in the 2013 version, so it was worth the updat."
1,ive been using avast for my last 10 computers and have recommended it to all my friends. I have bought full copies and I have also used the free antivirus and have never had an isssue with any trogan or virus; it's great.
0,I upgraded from Quicken 2011 to 2013.  This version seems very unstable.  I like the mobile version that allows sync with desktop but don't have confidence in the reliability of this version like I did the 2011 version.
1,"My main reason for leaving thoughts on this product is that I just didn't see any of the problems that a lot of the reviews talked about. I was coming from Quicken essentials on the Mac and that program is vastly different. It's much better here on the Windows side and far more useful. That said, there was certainly a small learning curve because every single thing is presented and accomplished completely differently. I am having a really hard time understanding how two user interfaces can be so different and how the feature set can be so completely lacking on one verses the other. Almost as if they came from different companies that didn't so much as have a meeting on what they were trying to do exactly.<br /><br />As for this version: I think it handles the basics nicely. I haven't had a crash, glitch, or bug of any kind with either Quicken or with the apps that I use to sync across platforms. I am currently using the Apple variant on both phone and tablet. They both work well, although limited in scope.<br /><br />I have to point out that I am not using this program to the extent many people likely are. For me, it tracks bank accounts and keeps track of upcoming bills and just generally keeps me current with my finances. I'm not tracking investments or even credit card accounts. I've played a little with some of those things, but having not had access to any of that on the Mac version, I guess I just sort of developed &#34;a way&#34; of using Quicken that seems to work out for me. Credit scores and things that get away from what I use this for aren't really something I can speak to. Seems like every card I have offers a credit score anymore and normally its not a true FICO score anyway. But, I haven't tried it on Quicken.<br /><br />But honestly, Id recommend it to somebody with basic needs to track and plan. If it's any good for investments, credit tracking, and knowing your net worth is a subject for another reviewer.<br /><br />But, to the degree that it's buggy and crash prone and mostly broken....I haven't seen that. I've been pretty pleased with it."
1,"Rollback is an excellent software much easier than windows recovery, very easy to use"
0,"I've used this software for years without much trouble--it's not perfect, but it's easier than doing it on paper and cheaper than the other popular brand. This year was the last, though; after using up all five tries, the thing still wouldn't go through to the IRS and the program can't tell me why. I've checked and re-checked the return and have to conclude that I've been hit with the same software glitch that has caused so many other filers to have the same issue this year with the same reject code. I'll have to mail the paper return instead of e-filing, which is still easier than doing the return by hand to mail, but if we owed money, or if we needed our refund sooner, having to file late or receiving the refund in 6-8 weeks instead of 2-3 would be a problem. I won't be buying from Block again."
1,"I've used Quicken for over 20 years.  It has had too many bugs in general for such a mature product but this is in fact the best release to date.  The application for once feels faster than the prior release rather than slower!  The upgrade process for the 2013 file was also much quicker than in the past.  It also has some bugs cleared up and the budget feature is improved.  They for example have an 'everything else' category to show in budget reporting.  Previously it was possible that you might only budget certain sub-categories and if you spent in a non-budgeted sub-cateogry you'd not see you're over budget.  Now with the 'everything else' catch all, you can't miss any over spending in the budget feature.  5 stars may be a little generous as it is not perfect, but it appears to me to be the best version yet.  Those who complain about not that many new features....and that you are forced to upgrade....should stop complaining.  The software is not that expensive and someone needs to pay them to keep it current with bug fixes, new windows versions and new download updates to keep sync with the banks.  Small price to pay to upgrade each year or two.  I'm grateful this is still being produced as there is no cloud or web only software that yet comes close."
1,very good
1,"Seems to actively protect EVERYTHING without slowing my computer down.  For my family, I'm running it on two desktops, three netbooks, and four laptops.  It's kept every computer virus and malware free.  It even actively protects our emails and has stopped dangerous emails on numerous occasions.  I have even started running it on the family's android phones and tablets. I've tred all the top name antivirus programs.  Avast Free Antivirus 2014 definitely beats them all!"
1,"This product is exactly as advertised.  It is easy to set up and use, gives excellent data and makes running various scenarios simple.  It is way more versatile and accurate than free programs available on-line.  I'm delighted with my purchase."
1,worked well!
1,We use this at work and I love having it installed on my home computer. Easy to use and very handy for taking screen shot!
1,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, so these are her words below:<br /><br />Love the Symmetry tool. The program is almost human. It \\""listens\\"" to me so well. It does what I want it to do before I know what I want to do! Really like the variety of tools it gives me to choose from. It is great to be able to see others creations as it boots up and before I start my own."
0,"I buy the same version every year for the last 15+ years, this year I find out that I can't do Schedule D form in the Deluxe version I have to spend another $30+tax for the Premier version. Thanks Intuit and Amazon for letting me know that there was a change. Sure Intuit says that I can get a rebate after filing my taxes and applying for the rebate before April 20th. Let's see if I fall for that next year when I buy your competitors product :("
0,"Goodbye TurboTax, hello H&R Block.  I was very disappointed with the news that some of the schedules and forms that were supported by Deluxe are no longer available in the 2014 edition.  In order to process my return, I'd have to buy the Premier edition.  First off, TurboTax is priced higher than H&R Block, not a deal breaker, until I found that I had to upgrade to the Premier edition for significantly more.  For example -- H&R Block Deluxe is $32.99, TurboTax Deluxe is $38.69.  If I want to file like I always do, the Premier version is roughly $55.00.  I'm sorry to say, but I've been loyal to Intuit for years, but this is very disappointing and aggravating to me.  TurboTax was very good, but I'm going with the H&R product this year.  I'm glad that I didn't purchase and THEN find out about this radical change.  Shame on you, Intuit - I'm sure that you are going to lose quite a few loyal customers as a result."
0,"Avast seems to do it's job, but it slows down the PC almost to a stop and sometimes it DOES totally freezes up the PC completely."
0,Basic CAD system. Works well.
0,"Just an fyi - make sure that you MEAN to buy just MS Word.  If you decide later you want to upgrade and get the rest of the Microsoft suite of products, you can't.  Their sales team and their customer service team is completely unhelpful and you can't return a digital download to Microsoft or Amazon.<br /><br />Pay the extra $25 and get the CD.  It will make your life much easier."
0,"disappointed that it did not include schedule K or allow for stocks that I sold, apparently I have to upgrade to premier"
0,some options disappeared
1,I like Quicken and I was able to run my back up file to restore all my transaction on to the new computer with Windows 8.1.<br />It works well for me.
0,Will not download to my kindle
1,ENJOY IT VERY MUCH HAD A 2005 EDITION AND FINALLY GOT A UPDATED ONE AND<br />FEEL ITS A GREAT TOOL
0,"You receive a key card with your purchase, and then verify your subscription and download Office.  It's the same card for PC and Mac, but it's a complete crapshoot whether you'll get the correct download.  In my case, I clicked on the Mac download, but it erroneously gave me the .exe file instead of the .dmg version.  If the product downloads incorrectly (and both Microsoft and Best Buy have concurred that this has been a problem), you cannot reuse the key. You have to exchange the defective product to get a new key, and then deal with Microsoft's tech support because you can only download 1 version of this software program with the same university account. In my case, I wasted over an hour with some guy who could only read from a script before I connected with someone who actually knew what they were doing.  Shoddy product. Shoddy service.  Microsoft needs to stop using its customers as beta testers."
1,First recommended to me by a friend.  Now I recommend it to all my friends.  Works without bogging my system down.
1,"So far, so good.  It seems to be easy to use and similar enough to previous versions that I am not completely lost.  Thanks."
1,Easy program to use. Self taught. Very simple user interface. So much simpler that the full version of photoshop. Use it for work.
1,QB Online has fulfilled this mac guy's dreams.  I wanted an accounting software that looks and feels simple and intuitive.  QBO has done just that.  I feel like I have a better idea of how my church's finances are doing because I can see an instant snapshot on the front page and I can navigate important reports quickly.  The best part is that I am not chained to a certain computer.  I can continue working anywhere I have access to the internet.
1,"I switched to Bitdefender 2014 after being charged a high renewal fee by Kaspersky with it auto-renew feature.  They charged me like $35 over what I could buy it from every retail store on the Planet.  I emailed Kaspersky and asked them just to refund me the difference between what their auto-renewal system was charging me and what Amazon was charging.  They wouldn't budge so I asked for a refund and decided to look elsewhere.  Bitdefender 2014 was leading the reviews and it was also on sale so it won out.  What a mistake!  Slow boot times,  tons of pauses with the internet, random PC freezes, and what I felt was a lousy clunky UI.  So after a couple of months I bought KIS again and all is working well again."
1,"This is my second year using Trend Micro. I love the programs  ease of use, and complete security. The purchase process was  smooth. I recommend this application to everyone with a home  computer or laptop."
1,So far so good...
1,instant gratification if you can call doing your taxes fun in anyway. The cost was less than in the stores.
1,"I was extremely satisfied with this product.  Having attempted to do our tax returns via a competitor's software unsuccessfully, I found this software easy to use and straight forward."
1,Great download for a great price.
1,Nothing can replace Office.
1,"Thanks to Avast for providing the sense of security I feel when I go on line. Regularly updating your service is a real plus.<br />  thanks, Jim"
1,"Had an older version for years, bought one of the latest ones from STEAM, and god what can I say about this, It has always been my favorite program for drawing / illustrating, I'm a designer and I need things done quickly, I have photoshop as well but photoshop is simply just too overflown with bazillion tools and options and quite frankly it can easily get a bit overwhelming sometimes -- so Open canvas was just perfect for me, neat interface, everything so simple, the custom brushes and else are quite good but you can easily tweek and make your own arrangement of tools just the way you want them without losing your mind in the process, and I just LOVE how you can adjust the pen pressure sensitivity for each brush right there on the brush configs little box - everything is just so handy and comfortable for quick adjustments on the go!<br /><br />I own a wacom intuos 5 and Open canvas is smooth as butter with this tablet -- closest to real life drawing experience I ever got -- the shortcuts and hotkeys are beyond useful and much MUCH more user friendly than the Photoshop ones, specially the ones regarding brush size adjustments which is done with the pen button while hovering in the air left to right -- not need to press extra keys!  at least that's how I got it configured and I LOVE IT.<br /><br />Also, something very important: Open canvas rarely ever crashes. like. for real, this program is SOLID. its so tiny and light you wanna know how they built it to be so consistent but whoa, it has never failed me once.<br /><br />I can't even count the times photoshop crashed on me completely ruining full on 5+ hours of works in a quarter of a second. Open canvas has never done that. EVER.<br /><br />If you bought it and just can't get used to it, give it time -- try the tools a bit longer, play around, sketch random things freely, toy with the configurations, have fun playing the events & watching the process of your own artworks coming to life! seriously, it will grow on you sooner or later, this program is pure awesome!!you sooner or later, this program is pure awesome!!"
0,"As &#34;free&#34; antivirus programs go, Avast is the best I've used. As long as you're not doing anything too stupid online its basic protection is more than adequate. I've been using Avast for several years and recommended it to many friends and relatives. Over the years the popups and attempts to trick you into buying the paid version have gotten much more obtrusive and sneaky. As long as you understand and accept that a fair amount of nagging is the price you pay for &#34;free&#34; software, Avast is definitely worth trying."
1,I have used turbo tax for many years. Works great.
1,"Worked very well for importing data, simple to use yet thorough. Got the exact same results as H&R Block software, but Turbo Tax was easier to use"
1,"Okay, it has been a while since I have really gotten excited about new software, especially financial software, but this version, coupled with my Android is definitely the exception! I was starting to wonder if Quicken was ever going to embrace the mobile community out there but with this new update it is everything I was hoping for and well worth the wait. Been testing the cloud, putting in transactions from my laptop and Android and everything syncs nicely. It will be a while before I can give it a full test, but at least right now I am pretty thrilled.  I am now considering for the first time when I go on 2 week vacation to Hawaii this winter NOT lugging my laptop along! This I would say is the biggest Quicken \\""must have\\"" upgrade since I started using it back with DOS 5.. Also kudos for the nice elegant interface on both the 2013 program and the app."
1,"I've used avast on all my Windows computers (XP to 8.1) over the years and now on my android devices  too.<br />I've also recommended and helped install it on dozens of my friends computers over the years since I'm the resident geek in my circle of friends.  It may or may not be the best virus catcher, but my not so computer literate friends rarely get themselves into trouble.  I think avast is outstanding from this standpoint.<br />Avast has saved me many times by catching malware and viruses.  I've not had perfect protection, but very close.<br />I don't recall ever having a bad release that had to be backed out.<br />No memory, reliability, or undue overhead issues.<br />It is, however, darned easy to click the upgrade now button and tricky to get back to the free version if you're happy with that.<br />Hope this helps."
1,"Slightly disappointed that this purchase is Mac only, as it usually comes with both.  New version came out just after purchase though, so may look at what an upgrade costs..."
0,"video and audio records out of sync, tech support sucks they will not allow you to contact them and will not respond to questions"
0,"I have had several bugs, had to reinstall  and still have issues. Haven't seen it help my life yet. May be later once all bugs are fixed."
0,"I really liked the user interface, password protection and other features of Norton 360, but it came with a price, and I don't mean in $$$.  3 current technology laptops immediately began experiencing performance anomalies, e.g., s-l-o-w response on internet regardless of the browser used; web pages would not load (blank white screen), other pages that did load were unresponsive to the keyboard and mouse - frozen, etal.  Uninstalled and loaded a CNET.com and majorgeeks.com top-rated anti-virus product that is FREE.  This was definitely money down the drain."
1,Great protection for free. I used it in all my computers and all the computers I service. Doesn't slow my computer like others do.
1,"I've used AVG for about a year and felt it truly  kept my computer running smoothly and efficiently and  is very user friendly.<br /> Wanting to renew my protection I discovered that Amazon has the best deal around so I purchased the digital version.<br />Instructions through Amazon and AVG are very easy to follow and after downloading  and entering product key codes etc..<br />I found that this was for a trial offer only.  I was so angry and felt I had wasted my money so I wrote a scathing  review, then went to<br /> bed.  I spent yesterday thinking about what had happened and decided there had to be some sort of mistake, it just didn't make<br /> sense.  Today I was able to investigate and discovered for some reason the product key # didn't get accepted, so I tried again<br /> and voila everything works beautifully.  So I deleted my nasty review and am rewriting.  As I originally stated I would give AVG a<br /> five star rating for their product and ease of use.  So now that I know this is not a trial offer only and this is the real deal, it definitely<br />deserves  a five star rating!!!  My apologies to anyone who had previously read my critical review."
0,"I haven't even been able to use them since downloading them. They don't pop up anywhere in the main program, so I'm still stuck using the standard tiles."
1,So far so good.
1,"I had not updated Quicken since 2009, so was not sure that I would be happy with the new product.  It is easy to work with and supports my needs very well."
0,"I went to 2013 hoping it would solve the problem of crashing when trying to download band and credit card transactions.  Unfortunately, it still happens.  Disappointing."
1,"Liked the free so much, bought a upgrade.  Better than Norton for sure.  Could of kept the free does almost the same as the upgrade but satisfied."
0,"Buggy as always, but overall still the best at financial organization and planning."
1,Excellent as usual
1,Great product as always Microsoft
0,I purchased the download version of this program which was a huge mistake. It has taken me multiple contacts with Amazon and probably as much time as it would have taken to do my taxes to get the program to install correctly. Finally have it after 3 days but sure didn't save me any time. 3 days ago when i bought it the price was $27.99 now today I see it's $18.99. I think it's so cheap for a reason. Would definitely not purchase again.
0,"It worked for two of my PCs, but the software became corrupted on a third machine.  Hours of support time spent with McAfee and it still would not install.  Other AV software worked with no issues.  I would not buy this again."
1,I have been using Avast for about 5 years. Never slows downs my computer and always removes anything it detects.
1,I am a professional kitchen designer for 15 years and have worked on pro design programs that cost thousands of dollars.( Three different ones). If you don't have a background in these types of programs it will take a LONG time to learn how it works...and to get it to do what you want it to. I am free lancing right now and needed a way to present my ideas. This program produces impressive pictures. GREAT bang for the buck.
0,No download from this product!!
1,"The product itself, I find, is excellent and is an upgrade from the regular Norton 360 I had installed on my 3 PCs. I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.<br /><br /> The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.<br />You wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.<br /><br />Now, how do you get your remaining days back from your &#34;old&#34; subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.<br />He also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.<br />So I have 2 more PC's to do this to, and it whould work out easy I hope.<br /><br />I hate to sound like I'm bitchy and whiney, normally I'm not, but this really got to me. If only the instructions were clear and accurate.<br />If you have no previous product to upgrsade from, you should have no problem. Others here have advised to uninstall the old product first, but I thought I was smarter than them. Well, I AM NOT, lol.<br /><br />Now WHY did I not wait untill my old product subscription expired? Because I wanted to make sure the reg key I got was valid and worked. The others were right. Uninstall the old product FIRST.<br /><br />Still after all my complaining, I give the Nortonn 360 Premiere PRODUCT itself 5 stars. The installation/upgrade process: If it were possible, I;d give it a minus 10. If only I could go back 1 day in my life."
0,"Even though it stated the State version was included, it was not.  I had to get on the phone with Turbo Tax and then finally Amazon to find out this information. For future, it would be nice if Amazon would say that the state version is NOT included with this software.  This is very confusing and I thought perhaps I should have purchased it from a store like Wal-Mart but Amazon said it would have been the same difference.  I had to print the state forms and mail them."
0,downloaded wester Europe only now i can not download the rest.
1,"It's keeping my computer safe and sound, easy to use, and cheaper than the main site!"
0,This edition offers nothing of value over the '12 or '13 editions.  I only bought it because I had to when upgrading to new hardware.  It does not scale well for smaller screens and has limited font options.  It still has limited ability to handle complex investing transactions and does not know how to categorize some of the newer investment instruments.
1,"Its working as it should, have no problems at all, love it, help stop viruses, an malware from taking over my pc."
0,Crashes the computer all the time and freezes it up.  Switched to Kaspersky.
1,"Like others have said, I had problems with the download/installation.  As part of the download, the program tried to initialize but appeared to hang-up.  Even after 30 minutes, there was no warning message on the screen.  After reading the other reviews, I remembered that I had this same problem last year.  The solution was to uninstall the old version of Norton and then install the new version.<br /><br />However, Norton wouldn't uninstall - even from admin tools.  This could have been related to the fact that my old version had already expired.  I searched for the Answer on Symantec's site and found an uninstall tool/app.  After I uninstalled the old version, the new version installed without a problem.<br /><br />It is too bad that the Norton install doesn't automatically check for a previous version and display a warning message prior to starting the new install.  This would save users from hours of frustration.  Or since this is a known issue, Amazon could also help their customers by posting a major warning since Amazon is also blamed for the problem."
0,"Poor support and on boarding, no phone support. The support techs all seem to have different ways of doing things.  My accountant, a professional, full time quickbooks pro advisor, has struggled for nearly 7 months to figure it out - it is completely different from quickbooks even they they are both supposed to keep the books. The import from quickbooks shows my balances off by more than $100,000 and NOBODY, ABSOLUTELY NOBODY, can explain why. The simple steps they tell us to do don't come close to helping solve the issue. We have probably opened 10 support tickets with them.<br /><br />They claim to sync automatically with your bank and credit cards. Good luck making that work for more than a few days, and good luck hoping it's correct. The third party company the partnered with for this service doesn't offer support, is discontinuing the product soon, and Xeros &#34;solution&#34; is to re-set it up every time. Really? 25 times entering the exact same username and password?<br /><br />We enabled their built in payroll system. Turns out that is provided by another company, and they don't support all 50 states. Now I have to do some payroll through their app and some manually.<br /><br />I found/hired a Xero certified accountant to work with my accountant. She is a great resource, but these problems have her flummoxed as well. She even complains about the varying support people and has us ask for the ticket to be assigned to certain support reps, because some of the things that they say are just off the wall whacked out when they don't understand the problem or have the slightest clue how to fix it.<br /><br />We are 8 months into our transition and still wondering if it's not smarter to go back to quickbooks (which I hate) or keep moving forward. Maybe someone from Xero support will read this and reach out and help us figure these problems out."
1,I have been using H&R Block software for my taxes for 8 or so years to complete my taxes for home and business. Great software that will walk you through everything you need to complete your taxes accurately and quickly. Checks your return for things that could be an issue and walks you through fixing the issues. You can complete fairly complcicated returns without having to review a load of IRS instructions to try and figure out what to do. Would recommend to anyone regardless of tax knowledge.
1,The title says it all.  It's free and works very well.  very user friendly interface.  I don't use anything else
0,"I've been using Tax Cut and then H&R Block at Home, online version since 2007.  I decided to use the software version this year.  When I installed and tried to import my data from the online version, it wasn't immediately obvious how to do that (although there are clear instructions for how to access your prior year tax information from their competitors).  Well, 2 customer service agents and 45 minutes later, I'm still waiting to figure out how.  The customer service reps don't seem to know that the downloadable software and online version are two different things.  Argh!<br /><br />If you typically use the online version, do yourself a favor and don't buy the software."
0,I downloaded this software and did a reboot. Immediately my computer started running very slow. I received a notification from windows defender that my anti-virus and firewall were shut down. I was able to reach my control panel and uninstall this program. My computer is back to running at normal speed again.
0,"I was forced to upgrade to Quicken 2015 because the 2012 edition would no longer download transactions from our financial services. There an enough complaints about that here, so I won't go into details.<br /><br />So I did the install. It did not give me any option as to where to install the product; it simply uninstalled 2012 and installed 2015. So there's no way to keep both versions on your system while you check out the new release. That is really stupid and inconsiderate towards users.<br /><br />Then it converted the database. Everything looked fine until I checked the balance on our business checking account, and it was *way* off. We use Savings Goals a lot. Q2015 did not import any of the deposit and withdrawal transactions for the savings goals. And it appeared that the savings goals were not connected to the checking account any more. I couldn't &#34;fix&#34; things by withdrawing the amounts back to the checking account, that just added the funds back and made the balance off even more. I finally had to delete the savings goals and add new ones, then deposit the amount they should have into them. And the checking account balance was still off by $920, so I had to make a manual adjustment to the account (payee: Quicken Screwup).<br /><br />And Intuit has completely messed up savings goals, IMNSHO. Instead of the account grid in previous releases, you get a page of HUGE buttons. Really, with only five savings goals and a monitor running at 1920x1080 resolution, I should NOT have to scroll to get to the last account! And it gets even better. The savings goals no longer remember the last account you deposited funds to. You have to select the account from the drop-down list every time. Since I do savings goal deposits every day, this is a big pain in the backside.<br /><br />So I have to agree with other reviewers that Intuit is not doing any significant improvements in new releases, and is in fact moving backwards in functionality. I also did not appreciate having to set up an &#34;Intuit Account&#34; just in order to use the product, and being nagged to use their cloud services and mobile apps.<br /><br />Quicken 2015 is functional for what I need, with some annoyances. But I am going to be looking for a replacement product. There are a couple of financial products (besides GnuCash) that are well supported and receive regular updates, instead of forcing users to upgrade to an annual release (at an annual price).<br /><br />Edit: Today Quicken 2015 updated to Release 7. After the update the program came up in full screen, when I had set it to run in a window so I can see it and my online bank statement at the same time. But that wasn't bad enough. It came up with the &#34;Open a file on your computer&#34; screen. Yep, it forgot the file that I use. And then it hung. I had to cancel it with the task manager, then launch the data file instead of running the program. The Quicken programmers continue to prove to me that they are idiots.#34; just in order to use the product, and being nagged to use their cloud services and mobile apps.

1,"I started using Avast when the company was in it's infancy and have watched it mature and refine it's products and offerings. It still offers a free version which is rich with great features (not a stripped down useless version like other companies do). This product has saved me from viruses on a handful of occasions which could have been devastating and caused me to reload my OS and applications. I have tried other products and found their full priced versions did not work as well as Avast free version. Avast also offers VPN tunneling for private internet connections, firewall and many other features for a low yearly price. Excellent product... Excellent company!!"
1,"Easy to use. Thorough and efficient program. This software makes the tedious process of filing state and federal taxes much less so. Of course, you need to have all the financial information gathered and typed in accurately."
1,"i have used rollback rx on and off since vista and have to honestly say it has saved me doing more than a few reinstalls of windows.  i have tried other software to protect my system but always come right back to rollback.  i would personally recommend it to anyone.  it's system restore on steroids.  since it runs before booting it works every time, unlike system restore that fails at least half of the time."
1,"I filed via Liberty Tax last year and was amazed at the fees. A lot of friends recommended TurboTax, saying that it was easy to use and led you through, step by step. They were correct. I wasn't too sure if I did it correctly or not so I got a second opinion at H&R Block, and they came up with the same amounts.<br />The only thing I wasn't too keen on were the fees for State e-file as well as the fee if you wanted TurboTax to deduct it from your return. This isn't such a big deal though, as it is still MUCH cheaper than going to a B&M storefront. I just wish that Intuit was more upfront about these fees as I can see them being discouraging to new users. The fees are made clear albeit in fine print, but I sure didn't read it!<br />I would give this product 4.999 starts if I could just because of the fees, but lets just round it up to 5. :o)"
0,"I bought this for per session limits, which it sounded like I could do. It doesn't do anything that you can't do with Microsoft security essentials, which is free. Even totally disabled and uninstalled, it has messed up my online games so that I cannot play them. I am on my second day of attempting to fix whatever this monster did to my computer that is will not allow online game play. If you want to be locked out of everything, this is the software for you, otherwise save your money. There is no return, as is typical, on software."
0,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for about 10 years now and I too am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe. No Schedules C, D, or E. In the past, the product was functional, even though the &#34;Premier&#34; version provided more help and guidance. That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it. But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing. So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes.<br /><br />Now in the name of &#34;consistency&#34; this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something much more expensive. I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be &#34;consistent&#34; and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version. Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money. Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we're supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price.<br /><br />Raising the price is something I would object to but it's just a price increase. It's the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it's not possible to give zero stars.<br /><br />Intuit used to be known for making products that pleased customers and surprised them -- in a positive way. It's sad to see the company's current attitude.<br /><br />I already gave a 1-star review to the new crippled &#34;Deluxe&#34; program. But I do need to use something and I at least considered the Premier version. Even in this high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories. I.e. only good for a tiny hobby business, and maybe not even that. So now having forced me to Premier, even this high priced product is useless to me. Intuit, what is wrong with you people?<br /><br />Everyone who reads this: Maybe you will have to buy the product in order to avoid the trouble of converting to another product. But even if you decide to buy it, please take the time to register a negative review here or at other product review sties.

Even if you have a rational reason for giving in to Intuit's extortion, maybe the negative reviews will cause other customers to choose other products. Maybe someday Intuit will be forced to care about customers."
1,"I upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2014 from Quicken Deluxe 2011recently. Most of the changes I've noticed are minor in scope - cosmetic changes to the interface (which I personally don't like) and some other enhancements that I really don't use. A smartphone interface is available but looks like it is more trouble than its worth.<br /><br />I have been and remain a loyal Quicken user. I want/need a stable financial software package that is easy to use, provides tools that address my needs and is secure. Quicken continues to provide that in this version."
0,"What a Joke, I don't even know where to start about all the issues with it. I am SO glad I only have a 30 Free trial. ( I guess we'll see how free my trial really is in about 10 days.) Do yourself a favor and download open office for free. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles, but it is compatible to office. The only time microsoft 365 worked was when it worked my nerves!!!!!"
0,"7-28-14 Update.<br /><br />Avoid this software.  There are so many bugs in it, its not worth the money.  Google docs can do OCR and now I mostly use it.<br /><br />Cons :<br />1. There is a constant pop-up to purchase the OCR when opening files.  Have not found a way to disable it.  There is not checkbox to not show again.  Very annoying!!<br />2. Not all the Adobe quick keys work eg rotate.<br />3. Sometimes when I open files, they show on the task bar below but I cannot activate nor see the file on the screen.  So I close out.  This happens sometimes when I double click on a file to open.  If I open the software first and then the file, it seems to be fine.<br />4. A few pdf files I opened had gibberish for text.  I re-opened with Adobe Reader and the text was fine.<br />5. Got an email from the Wondershare company via Amazon to provide feedback but the html link doesn't allow for feedback.<br />6. Annotating pdfs and editing the annotations is buggy.<br />7. Wont allow duplex printing, even though the printer system properties have duplex checked.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Price vs Adobe<br />2. Easy download from Amazon<br />3. Menu layout and color scheme.<br /><br />4-3-14 Update<br />Got an software update, and now you can disable the pop up on a file by file basis.<br /><br />Also found more files with text that open as jibberish.<br /><br />Purchased the OCR add-on for 10 bucks and again, when it works, its mostly good; has an issue with  funky fonts, fractions, etc.  But most of the time, the software crashes running OCR."
0,"I am an idiot and not at all happy with TurboTax. Being a long time customer of of both Quicken and TurboTax software (10+ years), I went ahead to decided to use TurboTax again this year because I thought they were trying to make amends. Then I find after downloading the Deluxe version, the State (which has always been included) is only available after I pay another $39.99 PLUS TAX to download it. That is more the the Deluxe version I purchased, plus if I would have known, I could have purchase the &#34;other&#34; Deluxe version for only $10 more. Last year there wasn't two Deluxe versions, (State and no State).<br /><br />Bye, bye TurboTax! Let's see how your customer service is because I am NOT a happy customer right now."
1,works very well!
1,verey easy to use great product
1,I'm totally pleased with my Avast antivirus program and recommend it often to all my friends  family and co-workers It is AWESOME
1,Pros-<br />Free version works like a charm<br />Does not consume too much computing power<br />Cons-<br />None so far<br />Other<br />I recommend this to everyone
0,OK
0,did not support my mac waste of money could if used it for gas !!!!!!! oh well money comes n goes
1,Effective as always. Pretty good price too.
1,Use it every year~
1,Been using turbo tax program for couple of years. Following each step makes it easy to make the correct choice.
1,"Ya man, I was able to to do a rough draft of my ideas for for the cover Art for Shuntai: Classic Gospel Mix and pass it on quickly to my graphic designer without having any knowledge of graphic design or composition."
1,"the product is very good, easy and intuitive, this suite was well set out in a óotimo.<br />Shopping with Amazon is always very easy and works great .."
1,"Amazing software.<br />There are some new fancy brushes which are cool but not really a reason to get it.<br />I have used Painter 11 for 3 years with a Wacom tablet and loved it. I upgraded to a Windows Surface Pro and It is a touchscreen which the Painter 11 had a little trouble with. It responds to my hand touching the screen the same way the touch of a stylus. I have tried Painter 2015 is much faster and working with a touch screen and stylus without it getting all jumpy.<br />Few of the things I find that are an improvement:<br />1. You can better control how much processing power you dedicate to Painter2015 in preferences. you choose 2, 3, or 4 cores of your CPU. It is useful if you are working on a large painting like a poster size collage. It used to be a pain with painter11 hanging when you try to make a large poster.<br />2. You can control the brushes better than in the old version, You don't just control Size, opacity, resaturation and bleed. There are a whole slew of controls for each brush like pressure, shape, jitter, hardness, bristle, angle and rotation..on and on. You just have to play with it a bit and when the brush is perfect save it.<br />3. Works better with Photoshop."
1,Excellent!
0,"Their *own* Intuit Payment Network does not work with Quickbooks now.  The hell?  Also, the new interface for credit card payments is atrocious and makes assumptions you cannot alter.  Even though I disabled the automatic applying of payments/deposits, let's say Joe Smith pays $100.  I do get the funding.  However, Joe Smith does not get the payment applied to his $100 invoice.  No, it automatically assigns the payment to &#34;QB Billing Customer&#34; and deposits the funds into the designated register.  And Joe Smith gets late notices and angry with me and my business.<br /><br />Multiply this times my hundreds of customers.  I have payments going into the ether that I am having to hunt down one by one, even though I can't change them.<br /><br />And customer &#34;support&#34;?  Well, they are &#34;working on the issue.&#34;"
0,The Quicken Deluxe 2011 I bought in November 2010 worked fine for about 10 months. After that it could not connect to my bank to download checking account transactions. Many other users have had the same problem -- see posts on Quicken Live Community. Quicken is aware of the problem but can't fix it. Their tech support and customer service is horrible. Sorry I bought Q-2011; I cannot recommend nor would I myself buy Q-2012.
1,"Just upgraded to version 2013 of Office and great new features make it an awesome upgrade:<br />  - Skydrive integration<br />  - Social Integration (if you choose to use it)<br />  - Fast!<br />  - Subscription option: Office 365 Home Premium allows me to load the entire office suite on 5 PCs or Macs!<br />  - Touch support (Windows 8 features!)<br />And a huge feature of the subscription option for me - Office on demand.  If I'm at a location or someone's office/house without this version, you can stream a copy to use temporarily or use the online version.  It's kinda the best of both worlds, online and offline features, so not tied to internet access.  Other little feature keep cropping up all the time (like clipart and creative commons free internet search for graphics to use!).<br />If you are on an older version, definitely worth upgrading - they even have a Try option on the office.microsoft.com site to check it out first."
1,We put this on all our pc's and our android devices.  We are very pleased and have had no viruses.  It also finds apps that may not be good on our androids and lets us know so we can delete them.
1,I have been using Avast since 1996. I have tried many others since then. I have always gone back to Avast.
1,"Where has libre been all my life!  I much prefer Libre to the hassle and irritation of Office suite any day.  Simple, effective and not near as buggy!  Just watch what you save your file as.  It likes obscure file types, but changing it before saving can keep it from causing issues."
1,I have been using Turbo Tax for about 12 years now and the features and interfaces with products like Quicken and financial websites just keeps getting better.
0,I only upgraded so I could use the phone and not the computer ( no wi-fi at home). Mobile apps are supposed to work like the computer. NOT !!!
0,Doesn't work as stated. Still needs more work
1,This is great! One password to remember. Open vault and log on with 1 click. What a time saver. It fills in forms. You create secure notes etc.
1,"Symantec once again produces an excellent Security product that was easy to install and use. Deploying on multiple devices was convenient and the tutorial was as expected, informative."
1,It's always better to buy from amazon because the stores have gotten do expensive.  I can share with the family and I like the speedy download.
1,Works great and is the exact product that I needed to be able to upgrade the memory in my Toshiba Netbook. Sounds in the new upgrade are a little annoying but everything is very easy to change.
0,I did buy Power Director 13 today to try a new software after many years with Adobe Premiere. After many attempts to load the saved project it seems that I've lost more than 4 hours of edition...unfortunately I can't return it.
1,I used it for years.  It's very good.  I'll keep using Norton until I find something better.  It's also light weight.
1,"Turbo Tax is a program that assists the tax payer so thoroughly that it is a pleasure to do taxes.  It not only take the information you have on hand, but also asks you about many items and situations that might be extra income or deductions.  I feel 100% confident doing my taxes with Turbo Tax.  I have been doing so for the past 8 years and have never had a problem."
1,"I have used TurboTax for years, but it is always a hassle getting the best price and service.  This vendor provided both!"
1,"Very intuitive and easy to use, a couple of small problems, but overall a very good value. Plus you can deduct the cost on your taxes."
0,I have always used the deluxe as I am a standard deduction for 16-17 yrs. due to investments.. the turbo tax package got more complicated and annoying for me each and every year. all added bs for my part. This year was a pitiful exercise in trying to squese more revenue out of customers to force them to go to premier. I still believe the ceo should be fired or at least provided no bonus. why do i need premier for standard deduction and  investments. two stars.
1,"So far I like most of the program as I have seen very little in the way of changes that directly effect me.  The one change I do not like is the fact that whenever I open an account in Quicken it now pops up the reminder panel at the bottom of the screen, even when there are no reminders.  The 2013 version on did that when there was a reminder, not all the time.  It's annoying."
0,Difficult to use.  Don't like it.
1,The downloaded version is great. I have had no problems with this program on my mac. love it!!! I have had no issues getting documents from a windows PC and emailing them from my Mac to others. This was exactly what I needed for my part time job.
0,"I spent a bunch of time on the phone and online chat with Intuit sales.  They promised lots of functionality and that the product was as robust as the PC version.  They lied.<br /><br />I called for support and got the stereotypical super-thick Indian accent support.  Also, they have no idea how to use the software.  I spent about a half hour on hold (after getting to support).  Every time you ask a question, they put you on hold for \\""two minutes\\"" which turns out to be a much longer period of time.  Then they come back and tell you that they are not trained on that topic.  Ask them to repeat what you want explained and they cannot understand.  They keep telling me that I cannot do something I haven't asked about.  Went through two support people and had the exact same experience.  Bad attitude too.  Asked to be elevated to 2nd level support and got a 1/2 hour hold with loud music...  Then they hung up on me.<br /><br />Got the Quickbooks 2012 for Dummies book.  It is designed for the PC version, but says it applies to all versions.  Since I was told that this is the same product as the PC version, I got the book.  It's not the exact same product, it turns out.  For the Mac version, you cannot import lists of vendors (or apparently any other information) so you have to re-type all of your data.  Excel or comma delimited text does not work with their proprietary .iif file format."
1,"Needs a little getting used to, but otherwise - very good program - especially since it is now available as an App for Iphones."
1,User friendly download/install process!  Computers run extremely well with PC Matic.  The automatic scan and fix scheduling option is great:  don't have to remember to do this!
1,"Great software and very useful.  Works very well with my Sony HDR CX240.  I used this on a project for class and works wonderful.  For many of you who have Sony camcorders this works better with Sony products.  Most of the camcorder market uses microchips for Blu-ray created Sony.  Companies like Canon, Panasonic use the Sony chip so, it will work with theirs as well.  I love this software because it make editing available for both apple and Pc products and it works with Pads as well.  It works better than apple movie maker.  Happy to say very user friendly.  I have Movie studio 11-13 and I can see this is well worth the money buying.  Especially the innovations Sony provide is top of the line.  Many of the negative reviews are from people who jumped from movie studio 9 to13 and don't understand the new concepts.  Sony is a forward progression.  Jumping from old edition to new edition will give you some shock also since this product is used in many types of computers people new to this may grumble a little.  If they would just stay in a forward progression on editions they will see it is well worth the purchase because adaptation to new technology gives a great advantage."
1,"easy to download & install, runs like any other software"
1,Works great in my mac!
0,"Thank you to all the people who created one-star reviews. I was instantly suspicious and after doing some research, switched to H&R Block's software. It's less expensive and does everything I need. **UPDATE** The H&RB interface is great, I like it more than TT and am glad something forced me to make the switch.<br /><br />Has anyone noticed that all the 5-star reviews are written by people who reviewed 3-5 other products, all on the same day? Shame on you TurboTax."
0,Never purchased
1,"Worked good, but was awkward to use, and uploading was not smooth, but generally a good program that I've used for years."
0,worse penny i ever spent
1,No surprises with this one. Have been using it for years and has always been a good value tor the money
0,I don't think this is compatible with Windows 8.1. There was no way to open the files and the error message stated it had not properly downloaded and the link to iTunes that it directed me to for another app that would enable file opening was not for Windows 8.1.
1,I was looking for a software program to enable me to draw to pc without scanning my print<br /><br />have to get used to not being able to turn the sketch book- but user issues<br /><br />program was very easy to operate & didnt take long to learn<br /><br />RECOMMEND
0,"After being forced to upgrade Quicken Deluxe 2011 due to Intuit's &#34;sunset&#34; rules, this version refused to convert my backed up 2011 data file.  I just wasted 2 hours with Intuit support without resolution (my case is escalated).  I'll revise this rating if and when I get additional help.<br /><br />In the meantime, I HIGHLY recommend that you impose a User &#34;sunset&#34; rule on Intuit and stop supporting Quicken (and Mint.com, and TurboTax, etc.).  Very frustrated!"
1,I had been a loyal Turbo Tax customer for 15 plus years until last year (2013).  The transition HR Block went without a hitch.  It definitely felt good paying 1/2 as much for equal product.  Even better value this year since I'm spending half as much for more a more complete production.
1,I used Quicken for Mac for years and got a new computer and installed Quicken Essentials for a few years. I was not all that impressed. Now back to Quicken 2015 and love it. Even better than the older versions. Would highly recommend it.
1,"I was in a hurry because I had a project that called for MS Publisher.  I'd never used it before but I can say that if you are used to MS Word, you will have no problems with the basics of Publisher.  It has an online help that really helped me if I got stuck but I had the project reviewed and done in record time."
1,"I see many antivirus or security suite programs in use daily in my work.  I have used the free version of Avast on several systems for a few years.  Avast is one with an A+ rating in my opinion.  It's true that malware exists today that can walk right in the computer door, without being detected at all.  I have run into websites dishing out ransomeware or scareware but I can tell you that Avast blocked those exploits.  In rating, I try to be unbiased, and I do not use any special apps or protection.  It pays also to learn the basics of what not to do to avoid malware, but good solid real time protection is a must, and I get that I feel from Avast.<br />  Computer security also requires vigilant updating of browser features, and even the free version of Avast has a program updating checking tool, browser cleanup tool and more!  I use several older systems and the latest versions of Avast do not bog things down in the slightest."
0,I have been trying for at least an hour and a half two hours to install this program I have uninstalled reinstalled I have done everything possible I guess whoever said Norton does not want you to buy from anybody else wasn't kidding I have to take my computer now to a computer store to see if they can make headway with it I should have just bought it through Norton cuz now its going to cost me more to have somebody try to figure that out
1,Downloaded quickly and efficiently. Excellent. No problems with this product. This is the second year that I have purchased it to use for taxes.
1,Works for me.
1,This charger is great. I have a note 3 and this thing charges fast!!! The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is that it is a little loose when you plug it in. Just feel like I have to keep an eye on it.
1,great
1,Always easy to use. Guidance is easy to follow. Have used TurboTax for many years.
1,Love it!
0,It is missing many key features and would not recommend to others coming from windows.  It is not that useful.
0,All functionality that made Visio worth using is now gone. You used to be able to use Visio to make a quick diagram of a database or program via reverse engineering and present that to non-technical clients. The tools to model a database are now barely useable by hand let along automatically. Why would Microsoft cripple the program this bad?
0,"This video was easy to upload pictures and the design was easy but limited to a handful of options.  However my review is about the music its impossible, and in between each song is a delay if it uploaded.  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL."
1,I always get  the NORTONS SOFTWARE when I can  its the great I can always depend on it it never let me down
1,Thought my work computer was gone and PC Matic saved the day.  Makes it run much better and faster.
1,free it's stops lots of crap and keeps me safer than without it. so I like it well enough used it for 5 years.
1,Norton is good but not that fast
1,"I do not consider myself a \\""numbers kind of gal\\"", but QuickBooks helps me be productive and helpful. It's not just about getting the reports out, it's about being able to provide information that helps our organization succeed."
1,Fantastic to do taxes with especially the import of last year's information to preclude reinputting and for comparison purposes.
0,a joke
1,Works well and very convenient
1,Excellent software for work. No issues so far.
0,"Did not understand a lot of the terms, no good guides or explanations. Turbo tax much easier to use. I recommend Turbo Tax over this product easily."
1,"I did not purchase PC Matic from Amazon; I am an Amazon shopper and I wanted to pass on to other shoppers the value of PC Matic.  I have an ASUS notebook N56E, 3 years old.  I recently started having some real issues with it.  It got to the point where I ordered a new ASUS Notebook (my 3rd).  In the interim, I had seen the commercials on PC Matic and then one evening I gave in to the commercial and purchased PC Matic.  I have been using Norton's 360 Premier Edition, along with ARO 2013 and I felt these were doing what I needed them to do for my maintenance and security needs.  After once running PC Matic it found Malware which had eluded Norton's 360.  PC Matic identified and removed 11 different malwares found on my notebook.  It also reconfigured some things, cleaned up my Registry and did an outstanding job overall.  My computer processor had dropped from i5 level down to i3 and below... it was like I had been tossed back 20 years to the old 14.4 dialups.  I have now had PC Matic for about 2 weeks, my ASUS N56E is basically back to i5 processor level with lighting speed opening and closing, better then when it was new.  As for the other notebook which I purchased... well I received it and I am attempting to learn Windows 8.1 and I am finding myself back on my old ASUS with Windows 7... yea it will take me a bit to adjust to 8.1 but until I do, Thank You PC Matic I can still us my older ASUS thanks to your software."
1,"Our little company does a small payroll with confidence that the taxes and reports to taxing authorities will be generated and easily sent for our account. it would be helpful if Intuit Payroll would get the processing for the state of MN's Unemployment and Workforce taxes set up for epay or eservices with MN. It is available and works in the ONLINE Payroll service. So the Desktop QB Pro and Enhanced Payroll need the same support. The QBs Calendar is useless for adding tasks, etc since there is no notification as dates approach or are overdue. Additional, this calendar and no other events have any notifications outside of having QBs desktop open and running and looking for these things that need attention. This does not serve us well for tax payments to be paid on time and those state reports that much be done on state websites. The only workaround is to post important dates in my Outlook Calendar. Duplication of effort! The same sort of thing happens with accessing the web for Banking log ins and downloads. QBs does not save passwords so that I can log in automatically as I can do in a browser (secure and or private browsing). Again, a time waster. Otherwise, we are pleased as QB Desktop Pro 2013 gives us a control of data that is preferred over the online QB as well as better handling of fixed assets and amortizations. Well, so far, we do not need an accountant or tax preparer. That is a saving of time and money."
1,Use this at work all the time
0,Had two call TurboTax in order to upgrade (they did it for free) to Deluxe for me to do what I used to do with Basic.
1,"Easy to use, very effective, and free.  What more could you ask!"
0,"I'm another long-time Quicken user who finds each upgrade more disappointing. Intuit keeps building in ways to make more money by over-regulating use of the product,[i.e. can't import information for checking accounts except through on-line service. On line service is time limited to insure purchase of another upgrade in 24 to 30 months.}<br /><br />This will be my last purchase from Intuit.."
1,This was easy to use however one caveat.  it was not very clear that you still have to pay to file the state return.
0,"I have spent 12 hrs and two pcs, trying to download the program!!!!!!!and still cannot get it to work. Now it tells me to insert a CD."
1,"TurboTax 2014 download met my expectations in preparing my federal and state returns. It was easy and straightforward, but my returns are simple with nothing complicated. However I did not realize that I would get hit for two state charges, one for preparation and one for electronic submission, for a total of $59.98. This was not stated clearly to me when I went for the download."
1,I've used this for years.  Always solid and dependable.  I love the Deduction Pro.  It's always easy to follow the interview process and saves me lots of time headache.
1,"So far so good! I'd never purchased software online and was a little skeptical, but it was a breeze to download and no real issues so far."
1,I began working with computers in 1988 on a Mac IIx. I chose Norton Utilities as my virus software because it was the only one available at the time and I have been using Norton ever since. It has saved my bacon on numerous occasions. I've tried other virus software but always come back to Norton for its reliability and ease of use. Their support live chat is always there.
1,love premiere. I am student
0,"Have been trying to buy this thing for weeks....   Persnally I have no bad feeling about the software (which is why I HAVE BEEN TRYING to buy this for weeks to begin with.)  Every time I click to buy, it goes to \\""We're sorry...\\"" error page and I cannot go any further.   This happens especially when the prgram is cheap (21 - 25 bucks range) Hum,.... Conspiracy here?   As a try-to-be smart buyer, I don't wanna spend a cent more than what the sale price is.  Can someone from Amazon please comment on this? I saw another exact same complaint below and a little bit surprised to see no comment.     PS. I am not a computer illiterate, I did everything I could do to fix/cleanup my computer, turn off firewall, etc. Please, Amazon, A LITTLE HELP HERE!!"
1,Excellente Video Editor.
0,"I have had nothing but problems with the installation of this program on my Mac with the latest OS.  It's very buggy, is constantly wanting to install updates, forgets the microphone, and is otherwise troublesome.  When I finally got it working, I was reasonably satisfied with the courses, though then it forgot my microphone again, so I had to quit the program.  Then, again it wanted to install a number of updates.  The program is reasonably simple to use, though sometimes you wonder what you are supposed to do.  The installation process is a definite failure, however."
1,"Update 6/19/15: Recently rated the best for 2015.<br /><br />I had 'Bitdefender Antivirus' on my main PC in 2014 and never experienced a problem; there was no spam associated with the program and I had no cause to contact them.<br /><br />This year, 2015, I've installed Bitdefender on 2 PC's (Acer & HP) and a laptop (HP) and the program has installed without difficulty. I've had bad experiences with Norton, but that might be due to conflicts with programs already installed on my system. Avast crashed my PC, and although AVG downloaded OK, there were some pop-ups. I make a habit of reading reviews as there are things I might overlook when making a purchase, and, I also check how many reviews a reviewer has made. It always strikes me as odd when I read negative reviews from those who haven't done many, if any, reviews of other products. Of course, there can be a host of reasons for that, but, I prefer to listen to reviewers who are experienced.<br /><br />In the event I run into any problems with this install I'll be sure to update this review."
0,"I used a previous Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 on my Windows 8 PC for the past two years. I didn't have strong feelings about it one way or another, but I also didn't use the computer much because I thought the computer was too slow. When I purchased an activation code for the next year, I was forced to upgrade to 2015. The 2015 version is AWFUL. Once it was installed we could no long send e-mail from Microsoft Outlook. I googled the problem and found that this seemed to be a common complaint among users of this software. I tried several work-arounds suggested by on-line forums including disabling the anti-spam add-on. We still couldn't send e-mail. So we contacted technical support. First, they claimed that they didn't know this was a commonly reported problem. Instead of logging onto our computer remotely, technical support said that they would e-mail us instructions to fix the issue. The instructions the sent us basically instructed us how to disable all Kaspersky protection for incoming/outgoing e-mail. This, obviously, was not the solution we wanted, but we tried it, and it did not solve our problem. Technical support subsequently (over e-mail) sent us several additional suggestions that did not work. Therefore, we initiated the 30 day money back guarantee process and bought Webroot. Once Kaspersky was uninstalled Outlook worked fine. Webroot also found 14 infections that Kaspersky had never detected. And for the first time since we purchased the computer, it was fast."
0,It works as advertised. It does have a steep learning curve for beginners. I wish more institutions had automatic downloading of data.
1,I love how I can size the screenshot easily.  Or make a short AVI file.  I use this for training my team and to send back information to the end users on what is needed.  Snagit is easy to use right out of the box.
1,this is the best internet sharing software i have used.<br />this is very easy to use very neat and sophisticated user interface.<br />no need to purchase a heavy router to share your internet.<br />i will highly recommend to purchase this software
0,"Doesn't work and the website makes it impossible to get help. I entered the code in to add Microsoft Office to my account, yet every time I add what country I'm from (US) in it won't allow me to add it and I can't continue to the next page."
1,awesome excellent perfect
0,"I've used Deluxe for years and like it.  However, I thought I was buying the package with the state program included, didn't discover my mistake until I began to use it.  Now, I'm really messed up.  The state program is relatively expensive (more than I can afford on top of this purchase), and if I e-file using what I purchased, I can't use any of the available free file programs to file my state because they all require filing both federal and state at once.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED!"
1,I find it hard to correct mistakes when using your program.  I suggest you have a  more USER/FRIENDLY correction program that a user can connect to  without any problems.
0,"...first question out of the mouth of Tech Support, so it's safe to assume they deal with angry customers all day long.  (So why aren't they good at it? Look at the reviews here and you can see that my experience is not unusual.)<br /><br />Funny, but where I was merely \\""annoyed\\"" when I started speaking with this guy, it only took another 30 seconds to get to \\""angry\\"".  He first \\""shushed\\"" me when I asked he help rather than force me to jump through unrelated questions and then followed with a threat to terminate the call if I didn't do it his way.  It was close to 5pm on a Friday and I didn't want to wait until Monday (they're closed on weekends).  Sadly, he ended the call abruptly after two failed attempts to correct my problem (an error on launch that said: \\""Dragon should not be run in elevated mode\\"".  Huh???).<br /><br />It's actually becoming less common (now in 2015) to come across a \\""reputable\\"" company so clearly indifferent to the consistently horrid customer experiences being posted here and elsewhere.  It's true that I saw these negative reviews before buying, but I thought that given my relative technical competency and robust Win7 setup that I would be an exception here and avoid a Tech Support that must be led by a manager who believes that Tech Support is doing the customer a favor.<br /><br />So just make sure you go into this purchase with your eyes wide open: Dragon's Tech Support is clearly not up to handling customers like me who immediately regret their purchase because of the (1) nonsensical error messages that immediately appear upon simply trying to launch the product, and (2) the unsolicited tag-along software that Dragon bundles into the installation."
1,"Even though the upgrade policy is evil, which forced me to buy this, I did not experience most the problems that are mentioned in other reviews.  They say it is really buggy, but I think it's pretty much exactly the same as Quicken 2012.  I did have a problem logging in, because you have to establish an Intuit ID with your email address.  I had done this years ago, but it failed to tell me that I already had one.  Instead, I had problems logging in, and luckily I remembered the answer to the &#34;favorite pet&#34; question that was set up years ago.  Then I was able to reset the password.<br /><br />Many people mistakenly assume that since they force you to have an ID, then their data is &#34;stored in the cloud&#34;.  That is not the case.  Intuit is just wanting to track who their customers are, and have ability to communicate with them.  I do think it should be optional, and I think it's wrong to force this on users.<br /><br />If you buy Quicken every two years, it is $25/year expense.  It is not that bad, compared to other tools.  I vowed to not buy it again, after I read these bad reviews, but we were going crazy, scrambling for a good replacement tool for it.  Until someone makes a better one, we're pretty much stuck.  I will still be on the lookout for for a replacement.<br /><br />Quicken has good reporting and searching.  The split expense functionality is too clunky, and sometimes it doesn't save it.  The memorized transactions get annoying, as they remember too much, and you have to go and clean them up.  Other than that, it's a reliable tool, that I've used for over 10 years."
1,"It is easy to install and does the job that it is supposed to do...keeps my computer safe and protected.  Also, apprecicate the good customer service Norton offers."
1,Based on previous years Turbo Yax Deluxe is very good
0,new version combined quicken essential with mint-minor enhancement to function. Using quicken for Mac 2007 still. Calendar has been removed along with a few others. I'm hoping the next upgrade will make it a more user friendly package
1,"Been using Avast for several years now and It's the best! It's free, efficient and user friendly ... who could ask for more?"
1,"Just acquired and installed TurboTax Basic 2014.  I also used the basic version for the past several years.  I started the 2014 process and it's very similar to last year.  It quickly found the 2013 data and imported it for the new tax year.  I'm retired with my only income from  retirement funds and Social Security so it will handle my tax situation quite well and costs half as much as the 2013 version.  So, it's a much better bargain for me."
0,It was amazing
1,I have been using TurboTax for many years.  I have found it to be very convenient and easy to use.  It is especially nice how it finds and downloads so much data from the previous year to save a lot of input.
1,"I am 2 months into using the MAC version versus the version on PC. The actual conversion of data was very easy. The harder part was understanding the MAC version, any similarity is accidental; however, I am finally getting a handle on how most of the tasks work. For basic accounting of household finances it appears to be very good."
1,I have been protected by Avast for many years...excellent Antivirus!!!  I would recommend Avast to people who want quality protection
0,It was the wrong program for my computer and I did not know it. Wasted my money and still need to buy the program. Will buy these sorts of things through a store next time so I can be better informed as to what I need.
0,"WordPerfect word processing works great, by far better and less intrusive than MS Word. Though the suite can be found for much less than MS Office, Presentations (PowerPoint counterpart) is a bear to work with. Quattro Pro I didn't even try. Corel should sell just WordPerfect as a stand-alone option."
1,Couldn't run my financial life without this software.  The download was smooth and the price was unbeatable here on Amazon.com.
1,"If you have a Blu-ray player on your computer and want to play them, you will need some kind of additional software.  That is, unless your computer already has Blu-ray software that came with it.  But very few do and so most of us need something more.  I have used this software in various configurations for many years.  It does exactly what you want.  There are plenty of extra bells and whistles as this program wants to be your desktop media player for music and video.<br /><br />I purchased this to play movies and transmit them to my tv using Chromecast and it works great."
1,"I've been using TurboTax for almost 20 years now.<br />I now take care of our joint taxes, our two businesses, and our children's taxes.<br />The program saves me time by transferring data from last year and I can get right to work.<br />I couldn't begin to tell you how much money this program has saved us over the years.<br />I don't like leaving any money on the table.<br />Thanks Turbo Tax!"
1,Great product. Helps explain everything
1,Avast has kept my computer save from many viruses.  Even when some of the high prices antiviruses fail avast has worked very well.
1,I love the Turbo Tax / Amazon gift card deal!
1,"I have used H&R Block for a long time and found it to be reliable and a good value. Takes a while to learn how to navigate it to make changes when needed. Sometimes there is frustratingly little help on some topics, but overall I do like it. In the past, I did use TurboTax, but switched one year when TTax ran into rather serious problems. Have not regretted my change, although both programs do get your tax done much easier than trying to do it by hand. Shows how bad our tax system is! This program is definitely worth the cost."
1,"As an owner of a women's fitness facility, I know very little about acounting. Quickbooks was very easy to understand. Customer serivce was helpful & easy to contact whenever I had a problem. I would definitely recommend this product."
0,"There's no question that TurboTax Deluxe has a very good tax return wizard. I have used it for a number of years. Intuit is no stranger to this task but it failed in TurboTax 2012. I finished entering my data, verified the return, printed it for my records, paid their $20 electronic State filing fee and I when I finally click the button to send my Federal and State returns electronically, Turbotax decides to malfunction.<br /><br />It tells me that \\""Validation failed: There is an update available for your program.\\"" I try to update but there is no update. It says \\""If this problem persists, you should print your return to file by mail instead\\"". I always file electronically, which is why I purchase TurboTax. I'm not sending it in via mail when I paid close to $50 to have TurboTax handle it electronically. I will find another way next year. Pretty applications that don't do what I'm buying them for will not be bought again.<br /><br />I decided to close the application and it then decided to apply updates. When it had finished applying these updates it closed. When I opened it up and went through the file screen yet again (For the 5th or 6th time) it successfully transmitted my returns. I spend enough time at work resolving software problems. I don't need to be wasting time on so-called commercial grade products. Quicken mortgages, Quick Books, I will not be going near these products based on this experience. Now the password that I carefully documented (opens the application) is not recognized by TurboTax 2012. Just great!"
0,Turbotax still does not support form 8960 and thereby you will be unable to file taxes early. This is no good. Other products already support this.
0,"Please read all comments for the \\""whole story\\"" Gave up and asked for a refund after 30 days NOW THEY ARE REFUSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />NOT Ready for release and customer service went from mediocre to HORRIBLE:<br />At first it would not install. I found a fix on their knowledge base but now it will not start... Click the icon and it shows up in task manager for a few seconds but disappears without doing anything, not even a pretty splash screen or error message. Over two hours on the phone and they say the should get back with me in a couple days, maybe?????<br /><br />The worst part, it uninstalled version 12 (which worked) and I cannot find the install disk. I am out of luck and Nuance could care less. They have my money I have nothing. Very Disappointed!!!<br /><br />Careful not do fall prey to the \\""newer better Version 13\\"""
0,I use Norton 360 exclusively  I bought new laptop last June and got Norton 360 right away.  However I bought this too soon. as my present expires July 8 . so I will download it then..
0,"I tried to install this with my Windows 8.1. No luck ... even after hours of assistance from the tech support person. He finally gave up and issued a refund to me. I later bought this at Office Depot, and it installed easily."
1,"Great product, fantastic price! When I tried to renew my older subscription with this one, I was told I needed a code that was not included with my Amazon purchase. However, a call to Norton's customer support provided a quick fix, and I am very happy with the resulting product."
1,Very good product
1,work good
0,I didn't know I was getting CS6 old version..... what's the difference? Do I get less updates? Are there less tools?
0,"Like talking to a bratty child.  Once they realize that you know a bit about payments and credit cards, they place you on eternal hold while they make excuses why your payment did not go through.  They blame the bank, they blame you, then they try and get you to call your own bank to authorize a transaction.  Over 1 hour trying to deal with total incompetence.  Never again!"
0,"I used to use Onenote a great deal. Now, it is so crazily put together that I cannot use the program at all on my home computer. I keep attempting to send articles to Onenote and the articles disappear somewhere. I am really disgusted with Microsoft. The older version of the Microsoft at least was put together logically. Microsoft seems to be run by a bunch of idiots who are thrilled with their own crazy way of doing things."
1,It worked very well for me.  I use it every year.
1,"Thank you good product really & friendly customer service, will do business with you again soon."
1,We have used TTurboTax for years and like that it enables us to do our own instead of having to pay an accountant to do it.
1,Afterconcern about  the initial mess up by Turbo Tax I purchase this tax soft ware and was completely satisfied with it.
1,I don't have to be a CPA or scholar wit any tax law knowledge....the program is easy and straight forward. Answer the questions and it's done...CORRECTLY.
0,"Quiken is a great product. However there is really no difference between the 2013 and 2014 version. So those who have not upgraded to the latest, don't bother. Be happy with 2013 or even 2012 and 2011. The improvements are trivial"
1,"This is so worth it.  Cheaper than the Norton site, same product, received the download immediately and was up and running"
1,It is everything you expect from this kind of software.
1,"I took the leap to upgrade to 2011 from 2008 because my new job requires I have Exchange capabilities and I only had the Student edition of 2008. I did not upgrade to Lion so I am not sure if some of the problems others had were Lion-related issues. Anyway, over 11,000 emails moved right over as did my contacts and calendars. Haven't configured the Exchange email address yet, but the IT guy can do that. It was easy, and so for no issues. Nice interface, but I am not a true power user, so some of the dings others gave the program are unnoticeable to me."
0,i did not like not getting one free state tax refund. i have to file 2 state returns
0,Very disappointed that it's not backwards compatible with my previous version. I can't get any of my data transferred.
0,it was infected and when it was installed it locked up m computer
1,I appreciate the step by step part of TurboTax. Easy to follow.
1,Buying software online is the only way to go.  Environmentally friendly.  I have had the best results from H&R Block
1,This is the best free antivirus program.  It blocks all attacks and the updates are seamless. It also scans very fast. It does not slow down my computers as others do.  I have used this free product for all my computers and none have ever had an issue from a virus.  Better than others I tried.
1,"I'm a long-time Quicken user.  I bought the 2013 version, because my older version was going to &#34;sunset&#34; and I would no longer be able to download transactions from financial institutions.  This version has received lots of bad press because of problems with its &#34;cloud&#34; synching and mobile features.  It's only been out a few months and it's already at revision 9 as of this writiing.  I don't feel comfortable with having my financial information in the &#34;cloud&#34;, and I don't use my mobile to access Quicken, so those are non-issues for me.  If you'd want to use those features, I'd check out the latest chatter online to see if the problems have been resolved.  The remainder of Quicken 2013 seems very much like the older version I've been using.<br /><br />I do find it odd that Mint, which is also owned by Intuit, can download balances and transactions from my wife's TIAA-CREF retirement account.  Quicken has never been able to do that, and the 2013 version still can't.  It lost one rating star because of that deficiency.  I still think Quicken is the easiest-to-use personal finance package available and well-worth the price."
0,First you have to buy the software then your bank charges you to use the software. What a rip off.
0,"This product is supposed to work for both home and business.  However, the business portions are bug infested this year.  The trust return features will not handle a final return.  The S-corp program has a non-fuctional depreciation section.  You'd think they'd test this software before putting it on the market.<br /><br />DON'T plan on doing even a simple trust of business return with this product!"
1,"Easy to install , updated.and real secure my computer laptop. Price was very reasonable norton is the best internet security I ever seen."
1,It's good to be directed.  Then I don't hopefully make mistakes.
0,using kaspersky for almost 7 years in my laptops and PC. Having some issue with 2015 ver... it takes at least 2 mins for update\rootkit scan from boot up in Win 7 before I can click on any icons in desktop. Never had any problem with 2014 ver. Similar it doesn't work well with firefox browser (which is my fav browser) and stopped using it because of this. Not sure if I'm the only one having this issue...
0,"I have been a loyal TaxCut/H&R Block user for the past 6 (maybe more) years... but was greatly disappointed this year. I was happy when Deduction Pro was introduced, refined and improved, but this year, having it only accessible online is AWFUL. It's slow (I have a very fast connection) poorly designed, user un-friendly and just plain BAD. If you don't have a lot of deductions, then the program may be fine for you, but for those of us who grew to like Deduction Pro... no thank you. I will not use this product next year.<br /><br />Probably time I checked out other products anyway... let's see who else is in the market next year."
0,I paid for the state software and could never download it.  It redirected me to Turbotax site to pay for it again!  Turbo tax customer service sucks as well.  They closed my case without doing anything.  I am into it now for $96.54 and have NOTHING!  I am now on hold for over 1 hour already!!  This is my second call to them with over 1 hour wait time.
1,Couldn't live without it.
0,Would not load properly and website was no help.  Glad it was free.  Uninstalled and went another way.
1,It's a great product and made doing my taxes pretty easy.
1,I think the calculations are fine.  I used to prepare taxes and I don't see any errors in this program.<br /><br />The counter-intuitive part was that you have to put State estimated tax payments in the Federal interview screens.
0,"Good for home finances, but not a business software. There is no inventory tracking. It feels as if business was slapped on the title so business owners would buy the product. Well I was fulled and spent $110 to my dismay. I am now out the money as Intuit will not refund the money as I am 10 days outside the 60 days for a refund, so I eat the cost. I am now in search of a product that does all the business things I am searching for in software."
1,"I started using it in 2009 because of my higher volume stock trading and dividend reporting.  The 2010 program pulled in the 2009 info nicely and this year it also provides automated interfaces to mine and other brokerage accounts for capital gains and dividends.  It does very well on itemized deductions  and even Schedule-K as well. I am a fan!  I don't need the state program as my state offers a nice online e-file tool.<br /><br />Buy this product, it's great."
1,the software looks amazing ! and you cant get better than the price i paid for it !!! a great buy
0,"I am royally pissed because TT is requiring Premier (and possibly other) users to use the Step by Step method in order to efile.  I read some reviews but have not yet seen this complaint by anybody else.  The Step by Step method is unbearably slow and tedious.  I can't return my package now, bu I think I will go to H & R Block.  I have used TT for many years, and (all but 1 year) have been able to efile, using the Forms method (which means I had no errors).  TT support seems to be less accessible this year.  I notice that it is more difficult to access the Community Forum.  Goodbye TT!"
1,"First off, filling out taxes is a pain. But having said that, the H&R Block at Home Deluxe tax package is a good tax package. First off, the good points. I was able to download Stock Selling information out of my retirement accounts directly from my broke. The information was accepted by the right forms and it saved me hours of filling out forms. Also, the preparation of my taxes and Efiling it with the IRS was excellent. Now for the only nit I have. I was trying to figure out where to add abandoned property on my forms and could not do it. I had to go back to my broker and he told me what and where to put the information into the tax forms. Overall though I am quite happy with the H&R Block at Home Deluxe tax package and will buy it again next year."
0,"the only reason i upgraded was because quicken made me - seems a bit illegal these days and certainly immoral - but they wouldn't let me download my transactions from my bank any longer without upgrading.  nothing new in the new version that gets me excited..  still has many flaws in how things are downloaded - categories, tags, etc..  but had to have it.."
1,"I was leery about upgrading from 2012 to 2015, this upgrade went perfect no issues and everything transferred and the phone app work right away. My last experience when i upgraded to 2012 was horrible. The one change i like is you have to type in your password before the program opens now."
0,"I have used Adobe Photoshop at work for about 10 years, but I've never upgraded and am still using the original product.  I don't use a lot of the features, so I'm probably not a good one to review this, but I'm upset enough to do so.  I finally ordered it for my home computer because I saw that they had greeting cards software with it.  I make my own greeting cards for my family, so I thought that would be great.  So far, I haven't been able to figure it out.  It seems to have very few choices and none of them work with the cards I use and when I try to get into using it, it says I can't unless I become a plus member, which costs a monthly fee.  I'm very unhappy, because it's so complicated now, I doubt I'll use the photoshop part much either. (It's just easier to use the Windows software).  It was a waste of money for me."
0,there is something missing on the download and have had to re-install it several times.  Not sure what the issue is - usually Intuit products are pretty good.
1,I've used TurboTax for years now. It does cost something to buy and use but I don't miss filling out the forms the old fashioned way. I still don't file my taxes by efile even though you get that included in the cost for the federal return.
0,"Renaming rules created a problem.  Any purchase from either a store, a business or a location that had the word \\""Apple\\"" in it was automatically renamed to \\""Apple\\"" and automatically categorized in \\""Software and Electronics\\"".  My hometown has the word apple in it so all my transactions were automatically renamed in this category creating a lot of extra work!!!!!!"
1,Training isn't nearly as time consuming as prior versions.  Up n running ( After download ) in 5 minutes compared to 10 to 15 minutes on prior versions.
1,"Same old Avast,,,, a little bit of a virus itself when it comes to removing it."
0,Had to do an upgrade of the product to work on a  newer version of Mac Product  still does not work I will have to call customer support
1,Very good antivirus.  Has picked up several virus for me.For me Avast works better than AVP or whatever the other popular free antivirus.
0,"I love Quicken 2003 but needed to change computers and upgrade.  I loved the ease of use of 2003, switching between various accounts and the look and feel of the user interface.  All I want is account management and for me those basic features on 2013 are lacking.  Perhaps over time I can find and get comfortable but after just switching so disappointing."
0,"Incorrect description - this is not QuickBooks, but only the license codes for the enhanced payroll.  If you want the two together for almost identical price, search again."
1,I update to the current version of Quicken and hope someday they make improvements. Well from the operation of 2013 there is no difference from 2011 or i just do no not use the functions they improved. There may be security changes and other changes that users do not see.<br /><br />I would like to see full integration with Outlook so I only need to update customer information in one place.
0,"Congratulations.  My 1st one star rating ever.<br /><br />Miserable format.  Obtuse.  Counter intuitive.  And most of all, misleading.  Deluxe is now stripped of the common schedules that I have used for the past decade.  Promised &#34;Free upgrade&#34; was nonexistent for this returning customer.  Had to pay $ 40 more just to get a Schedule C form!  Incredible.  And never again.<br /><br />Intuit's new business model has succeeded only in driving this longtime customer to H.R. Block next year.  Read the reviews people.  RUN, don't walk away from this product."
1,"My son ordered and downloaded from Amazon and helped me.  It was a bit complicated  since I need a simplified version of return. only problems were some dividends and interests and some stock trades.  Anyway I was able to file the Fed and State, and approved"
1,I've been a quicken user for years.  The upgrades are very good.
1,"Be very careful when downloading: I accidentally selected Espanol and ended up with the Spanish version of the install-software. Unfortunately, once I selected the language, there was no way to correct my preference and the only version of the software that I could download was in Spanish.<br /><br />Thankfully, the serial number doesn't care what language you use, so I was able to install using the English version that Microsoft has publicly available for download at some obscure URL through their Digital River website or where-ever it was. Moral of the story, use a touch of caution and avoid spending 30 minutes on the phone with the nice Indian lady from Microsoft support.<br /><br />The program itself is over-priced, but good and a whole hell of a lot better than WordPerfect / LibreOffice / etc."
1,"We just began using Q 2015.  It looks and feels like Q 2013, so there is very little impact to the update.  We go all the way back to Q DOS days, and the upgrades always provide a bit more facility, much more than we use."
1,"I have been using Quicken 2000 to enter all my expenditures, the goal being able to print all my tax related totals easily every year at tax time.  I upgraded now because I wanted a version I could run on my Windows 7 PC.  I was not interested (and security-paranoid) in the ability of Quicken to connect directly with my online bank accounts, sync with my phone (which is not a smart one anyway), set up my budget, and import data, though I could see the convenience value of those features.  I was pleased to find that I could choose manual entry for all the info I track without entering any financial website passwords.  The user interface and input methods are a little different than what I'm used to, but I got the hang of it quickly. Does all the basic good stuff my old version did...which for me is a very good thing.  I bought the Deluxe simply because it was less expensive than the basic version at the time.<br /><br />Edit: Not sure why this is showing as the download...I purchased the disc."
1,"As good as Pinnacl Studio 16. I wanted to have the extra fetures, but have not explored them yet."
1,Satisfied with it's performance.
0,Very poor!  Bought with state and then had to pay extra 20 to do state.  A certified tax preparer would have charged me less than I spent and no headache of doing myself.  Would give it a 0 if possible!
1,I Was not happy to hear about the issues with Minnesota state taxes. It would have been nice to hear from turbo tax
1,"We recently upgraded the company to Microsoft Office Suite to 2013 (Office365, actually). A few users were in need of Access and, while installation of the 2007 version is no problem see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2810106), we decided to upgrade the &#34;power users&#34; to Access 2013. The biggest issue was finding a static license, i.e. something that is not based on subscription. Amazon had a deal that saved us $10/license and I jumped on it. Installation was a breeze and our database opened without any issues whatsoever. If I should ever need to use it my self I will add some more information about the actual use."
0,"I've used TurboTax before but never again. I live in NJ but have NY-source income. Bought the Premier package, which includes one state (NJ). Bought the NY return and downloaded. All was well until the NY state return came up with no info. No name, no tax year, no income, no expense, no nothing. Deleted the return--as directed by someone at Intuit based on another customer's similar complaint--and tried again. Same result. Don't waste your money on this one. Something's happened this year. I've seen numerous complaints about the same thing on their online forum. Seems to work for federal (and NJ) but how do I know? Now I have to prepare the NY return by hand and then get my money back from Intuit. Joy."
0,"Ok for the most part. Limited drain on system. Would be better if it didn't randomly decide that my license key was invalid. Recently had to spend a half hour trying to get it to work again. It had to go online to check the database, but it terminated any internet connection including its own. Fixing it required me to go out on the internet with NO VIRUS PROTECTION because Kaspersky decided my license key was invalid.<br /><br />If I have a license that says it is good for 365 days, 240 left, why should it require an update to the database file? Why would it terminate my protection because it cannot see the company license files? Seriously unhappy with this development and may go back to Norton."
1,I updated to Quicken Deluxe 2013 because I have been using Quicken for the past several years.  I am only using it for documenting finances so cannot comment on budget planning features.
0,"I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.    I had to email \\""customer support,\\"" since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.      I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!"
0,"worst service, untruthful explanations, broken promises, Will never use Turbo Tax again!"
1,I used this product every year. You can't go wrong with this product.
1,"I used various versions of JASC's PaintShop Pro for years. It's all I ever needed. When Corel took over for JASC I was skeptical and put off upgrading. I finally downloaded X6 and to my surprise it's an improved version 9. I have read a lot of the criticism and just don't see the negative issues. For the low price X6 is a great program and should fit the bill for most users. Finally, the most important positive for me, in my opinion, is the superior interface."
0,"Still has bug's reconciling accounts, it today's times no excuses. Get with the program Mr. Quicken"
1,I have several cook book software's and I have abandoned them for Cook'n.  This is by far the best program I have ever used.  The search engine is great.  I just had an issue when I tried to up load windows 10 and the tech support was great to help me resolve the issue..  I have purchased Cook'n 12 and can't wait for the new upgrades.
0,"I have been successfully using Quicken for over 18 years.  I recently upgraded to 2013 from 2011.  A waste of money.  2013 works exactly like 2011. I was unable to detect any change from the 2011 version.  Very possibly I either do not need or want to use some of the programs Quicken may offer, however, 2011 did everything I wanted or needed and 2013 looks exactly the same."
1,great
0,"I am using Windows 8.1 and a Server.  I had to get the IT department to create a path to be able to locate files on my server from WPX6, but it can't seem to open the files once I find them.  I have to copy the files to a flashdrive and open the file from the flashdrive in order to be able to use it.  This is not a very user friendly interface and I would not recommend this product to anyone using the same set up as I am.<br /><br />As far as the features, nothing has changed in WP for several versions, and this one is no exception."
1,"We have been users of this program for several years and would not know what to do without it.  Recently we had some difficulty with it due to a bad upload of Java on our computer. I ended up working with Cook'n support, but still had difficulty getting the program to open.  Today, one of their agents dialed into my computer and spent over an hour correcting the problems my computer was having.  I can not express how professional and service oriented this individual was.  So, besides being one great program, you have to know that it comes with some of the best support available on the internet."
0,"Horrible ... my older version was a snap to use ... had to update from XP to 7, and the old print shop would not work ... still looking for something else - purchased Print Shop Deluxe 3.5, now this CD disc makes a nice indoor frisbee - however, I my old version is still on my old computer, so, using thumb drivers, I can use the old version, than transfer the finished project to the new Windows 7 computer."
0,NOT for international employees as in United Nations staff.  The software does not calculate Self-Employment tax for our specific tax situations.
1,The best and easiest virus program that I have used in yt 20 plus years of having a pc! :)
1,An excellent free antivirus program for home use.
1,I never use anything else for doing my taxes.
1,I am a chemistry teacher and MS Word 2013 has the symbols I need to write most chemistry lessons.  I can also easily import pictures and diagrams.
0,"This product is terrible! I just went back to Quicken 2009. I hope I can get my money back. The budgeting feature is so bad it would be funny, if it wasn't so frustrating. Subtotals on the reports don't even calculate correctly, and the totals even appear intermittently. For 2 weeks I've been &#34;flying blind&#34; as far as my budget was concerned because there was no way to view an accurate report of my budget. Don't waste your money. As far as I can tell, this market is wide open for a reliable product."
1,I've been using Turbo Tax for quite few years now and have had very good success with it.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a good tax program.
1,"In the last few year I shifted from TurboTax Deluxe to this H&R Block tax-return software, it's obviously (the price for the features) a better value for the money than competing version of TurboTax."
0,"After using online the past few years, and finding this year they wanted an extra $35 just for state e-file, I found this on Amazon to be an acceptable deal. It says very clearly provides both Federal and State return filing.<br /><br />However, this only includes filling out the forms for you, as e-filing (who wouldn't want to e-file?) costs (on top of the price you pay above) another $19.95! For the \\""convenience\\"" of them sending the digital forms along instead of you printing and mailing them.<br /><br />Very lame.<br /><br />I should also note that they say you can import last years information but ONLY if you had the same OS software program, and you cannot use online information. It requires a .T12 file type to attempt import.<br /><br />So if you want to avoid paying double for the option of e-filing your state return stay away!"
0,"They charge you a new software fee every time you try and file.. $39.95! Intuit has a monopoly, but their product has many flaws and their customer service even more."
0,"I've been using Quicken for over 20 years and can't understand how a product that once was excellent has turned into horrible. From lost data to inaccurate totals, the inability to handle complex or large numbers of stock transactions the product is no longer usable. I've spent countless hours on the phone ( with folks in India) who are always &#34;is there anything else I can help you with&#34; yet the promised responses/fixes never occur and the software just continues to get worse.. I have a high end i7 PC and the software runs painfully slow. I know this is due to my high volume of transactions (yeah I've got a lot of history with Quicken) but the only recommendation I could get was archive your data and  start fresh. I did and 14 months later again I  spend most of my time waiting for calculations to process or seeing &#34;Not Responding&#34; in the title bar.Like many other users, I'm at wits end and would change in a HEARTBEAT to a competitor software. QUICKEN -PLEASE fix it in 2015!!!!!!"
1,It is a great sw and help a lot for professional pictures.<br />It was a grateful gift for our old manager
1,"I use one-note to organize, what seems to be, my entire life. It is excellent for creating grocery lists (with check boxes!) which can be synced to my husband's cell phone with no problem. I keep track of work projects with this software also, because of the convenient search bar that will look everywhere in my notes. One Note saves me a ton of time. I highly recommend this to everyone, everywhere, that has anything to remember."
1,"Wordperfect has ALWAYS been so much better than Word, this is a bargain!"
1,"It's really revolutionary when you have the system on the go and everything stored on the cloud. It's so much more efficient to work on things anywhere than have to go to the same desktop computer sitting in your office. This is called technology. Just like people will never go back to paper when then have Excel and other software, now I can't imagine going back to desktop Quickbooks and have everything stored in a dumb hard drive. I'll definitely recommend QB online to anyone with a small-mid size business."
0,"Did what I wanted, allow editing Adobe .pdf file without paying Adobe's monthly editing fee.  My last .pdf file editing software is no longer being updated.<br /><br />However, came with many annoying extras that took time to delete and slowed my PC down after I decided I did not need them.  If I had done a &#34;custom install&#34;, may have been able to avoid them."
0,"I found the interface to be relatively clunky and unintuitive and it didn't do the one thing that I really need which was a scan to pdf function.  I was hoping to save some money vs. buying Adobe Acrobat, but ended up feeling like I threw away $20 and had to buy Acrobat anyhow.  I uninstalled this from my computer after less than a month."
1,I experienced a lot of problems with the 2013 version.  I'm pleased that with the performance of the 2014 upgrade.
1,I have been using Avast for about 5 years now on four computers and I have no complaints.  It does what it says it will do -- which is stop viruses -- and does it well.  It does not have all the bells and whistles of the other paid programs but I feel that I don't need those bells and whistles.  I will continue to use Avast.
0,"Have Quicken 2007 on an older PC and was hoping to migrate over to IBank on an Apple computer. This product has minimal functionality and was clearly a waste of dollars; transactional memorizing worthless, locks up, etc........."
1,"This software is excellent - works beautifully on my Mac OS10 10.7.5. It does exactly what it says it'll do. It's easy to download and install, and there's plenty of &#34;print documentation&#34; on line and video tutorials on YouTube. Highly recommended."
1,"My computer crashed, and it was VERY SIMPLE to reinstall TurboTax on my new computer.  I then opened my back-up tax file and was able to file my taxes.  Everything worked very smoothly as usual."
1,I have been using H&R Block Tax Cut now called H&R Block At Home over 12 years and have had consistent quality product along with excellent technical support when needed.
1,I own both Camtasia and Movavi's Screen Capture.  Camtasia has more features and I like it fine but Movavi''s recording and converting capabilities are faster and easier.  If you want to capture something on Screen and convert it to a playable DVD Movavi is the champ and much less expensive.
1,Light on the computer and does what it is supposed to do....and you can't really beat the price of this in stores.
0,"I have used Quicken & intuit products for over 10 years now.  This enormous company no longer offers telephone support.  When you &#34;schedule&#34; a phone call, they never call you back.  I have an issue that can only be done by phone.  They have missed their scheduled phone calls 3 times. They keep rescheduling me.  The chat is useless, or the workers are useless. Some totally inept. One guy couldn't even show me how to reset my password on my acct.  They take 5 + minutes to respond to you during a chat then often are unclear as to what they are saying.  Obviously English is not a first, second, or third language for them.  In other words, Consider this company as NO LONGER HAVING ADEQUATE TECH SUPPORT WHATSOEVER."
1,Well 3 stars says it' &#34;OK&#34;.  First let me say &#34;IT DOES THE JOB&#34;!.  My personal opinion is that it not as intuitive to follow as turbo tax.  I especially liked how Turbo Tax laid out last year and this years income and deductions side by side so you can see the year over year changes (and make sure you captured everything).  With this software I felt like I was flying blind.  Can't complain about the price though and I was ticked at TT for the changes they made  - forcing the upgrade to premier.  Baaaaad business move TT!
0,"Way more difficult than H&R Block software.  Less &#34;Intuitive&#34; than other software.  Too many updates!  Too slow to load!  Processes run in background even when program is not open and update feature is turned off!  Not at all sure it is secure or at least that it is not retrieving other, non-related, info from my PC to sell; a big business and money maker for software publishers now."
1,I am extremely happy with this product purchase. So easy to install as well !! I would recommend this product to my friends !!
1,"I completed my taxes and did the taxes for my 3 adult children, all in one afternoon. The program is easy to use, simple to understand and makes the painful process of taxes easier to understand. I have used this for 3 years in a row now, and I will continue to do so."
0,"I was a little disappointed what how basic it was, but maybe that is because it is web-based program through whatever browser you use. For the most part, it does include everything you need to write up and present a great business plan. For example, it goes over forecasting, target markets, benchmarking, marketing, etc.<br /><br />I would recommend it only if you get a good deal on the subscription. I used a gift card, but I think if I would of spent my own money, I would have been more annoyed."
0,Have been using quicken since 1991.  Wish I could go back.  Keep Hoping they will get it fixed.  I have had 6 support issues.  Do not upgrade yet if you can help it.
0,"I won't reiterate what others are saying here in regards to TurboTax Deluxe and the forced upgrade to Premier.  I needed to finish my returns so I bit the bullet and upgraded.  It cost an extra $32.70.  Enjoy it Intuit, because it's the last nickel I'll ever give you."
1,"hasn't let me down yet and I have been using it for years, one of the best free antivirus packages around"
0,"I have used Norton 360 for a few years.  I saw Amazon had a really good price and let Norton get as close to the expiration as I could before I planned to download from Amazon - too close, because it expired!  No worries, though, I had an Amazon gift card I downloaded to pay for the download only to find out AMAZON MAKES YOU PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD FOR A DOWNLOAD EVEN IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH $$$ ON YOUR GIFT CARD BALANCE!!!  I had to order the product rather than give credit card numbers on an unsecured computer.  Maybe this should be on the product main page?"
1,I have had an outstanding experience with Norton.  Their help desk is amazing.  The price from Amazon was the lowest price offered on the day I was looking for computer protection and everything was as expected.  No surprises.
0,Unable to load on computer with Windows 10.
0,"Purchased this and found it to be a disappointment primarily because unlike most accounting software, you cannot make a journal entry in Quicken.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone interested in keeping accrual based business, to look for alternatives."
0,"A loyal customer for numerous years, but the disabling of the Schedule D and the requirement to purchase the Premier Edition for $30 plus tax before you can continue with some schedules is a terrible way to treat your customers.  Yes, you've said you'll now let people upgrade for free - but those of us that have already been forced to shell out an additional $30 plus tax are stuck with only getting $25 back - you are still keeping $5 plus tax from early purchasers - $5 that you don't deserve.  This feels like such a cheat I doubt I will be buying any INTUIT products in the future - no more  underhanded surprises for me.  It is amazing that a company that had such a good reputation, no, a great reputation, could do this --- reading all your negative reviews I have to ask..... was it worth the extra $5?????"
1,Very good program
1,"A gift for my dad,really likes it and is helping him out alot."
0,Please DO NOT PURCHASE if you are looking for easy because IT IS NOT very confusing just wanted to let anyone know before wasting money on something they claim is easy to use.
1,It does the job it's free and it keeps me safe from spam and other things it's a good component to have on your computer
1,Some of the easiest to use image processing I have encountered.  This will be the best one you'll use.
1,"I've used Avast for years, and have been very well protected.  Easy to install and use -.good good good good good."
1,I was very pleased with how the software worked and with how quickly the link was sent for me to use it right away.
1,I am a CPA and used Turbo Tax for years.  Never been disappointed in it and found it to be accurate and helpful in getting taxes done.  I've tried some other products.  Turbo Tax has a better interface and I think it's easier to use.
0,I am a faithful user and though their software downloads would work.  First of all it downloads as a trial then after it expires you have to put in the product key.  Well this did not work.  I spent six hours trying to get it to work with Norton with no luck and Amazon customer service was not help.<br /><br />I now have to see if I can get my money back.
0,"customer service sucks.<br /><br />&#34;live chat&#34; kept me waiting while overworked staff seemed to be juggling several customers at once, and NOT resolving issues."
1,it was easy and quick to install
0,"Other than not including state, which the Matrix includes, this software is awesome. I have been using Turbo Tax for 8 years now, very good software, misleading description and title."
0,"Quicken 2013 is O.K. I'm used to MS Money, so it takes some getting used too. But all in all they both do the same thing.<br /><br />The reason I purchased Quicken 2013 is on account of Quicken offered a mobile App. I could really use a mobile App on my tablet.<br /><br />Wow, was I disappointed in the App! What a thrown together piece of garbage that doesn't even include the \\""Bill Reminder\\"". It is lacking other useful features as well. Hopefully this was Quickens initial attempt to put an App on the market and they plan on building it up to something worth while in the near future."
0,"Doesn't work well with Vista.<br />Personal TAB not working in my copy (second download), skips tabs. I won't recommend this software for vista users.<br />Update: Works fine in windows XP."
1,"I found it quite easy to use and it imported last year's return without any issues.  Some people say that TurboTax is much easier to use, but I haven't found that to be the case and I will be continuing with H&R Block Tax Software Premium + State 2013.  Downloading through Amazon was a breeze and I love not having the clutter of an extra disc floating around."
0,did not work. Please help. Said key was pirated.
1,"Best Price I could find as CD's are not available to purchase for Macs.  Apple can be frustrating, but I like my Mac."
0,"It did not apply to my business at all. I own a home and a business. I did not understand that it was meant for a &#34;home business&#34;. I couldn't get a refund, so it was money wasted."
0,Not what I was hoping for.  Not intuitive at all.  Difficult to draw plans for my new garage.
1,I have use quicken since its first year out. Have bought or updated all new versions. I don't see much change with this version. Just still have some issues with downloading bank transactions and reconsile. US Bank
1,This is a very nice upgrade to Quicken Essentials.  I had used Quicken Windows 2010 before switching to QE back in 2010.  I gave up investment tracking for a while because I preferred the Mac interface and it gave me a way to move completely to Mac.  With QM 2015 I easily ported over the data from QE then created a legacy QM 2015 file for the 20 years of investment transactions from QW.  I now have an up to date investment portfolio along with the rest of my finances all within QM 2015.  There are several features I would like added but the Q team has committed to continue with upgrades going forward.
1,"It was so simple to set up and and start using. Made tedious bookkeeping chores simple. Connects straight to my bank account so it helps me keep track of items I may forget about, especially if I can use it for a tax write off!"
0,"I am not the best with this stuff but an avid user, I really didn't notice any difference from the PaintShop Pro x4"
1,Works as advertised.  Easy to use disk backup program.  It replaced an older program of another vendor that had some bugs.  Works a lot better than its predecessor.
1,I have used this software for many years and it hasn't let me down yet.  Regular updates with IRS information is easy.
1,"Nice application to scan, track and edit documents. would like to purchase the pro version but is a little pricey, would think that you would get a discount if you purchased the basic version, let you upgrade?"
0,"I've used Quicken for a few years and recently was experiencing issues with it syncing my bank transactions. I did all the troubleshooting steps they suggest in their knowledge base to no avail. Thinking that they addressed these issues in Quicken 2011 I decided to upgrade. This version has even more bugs! One step update rarely works, I have to do the account update from the register page which is not very convenient as you have to reenter all of your banks challenge questions each time. Even when doing this not all cleared transactions are synced. Inuit's knowledge base and support is not helpful at all. Unfortunately you can't return software so I'm stuck eating the 40 bucks and uninstalling."
1,Works great!
1,Very user friendly and accurate.  Direct deposit is also a snap with this software. Payroll taxes are calculated.  It will remind you when paychecks and tax deposits are due.
1,GREAT purchase thank you
1,"always been pleased with my purchases, however, the bonus on this was the $24.99 fee I had to pay to file my state taxex"
0,"I purchased this mainly to record audio from the web, and I found that Spin Doctor crashes my computer whenever I try to record anything. Tech support is available for a fee & otherwise is non existent. I don't see why one should have to pay extra to get an expensive program like this to not crash one's computer. The CD copy function works, albeit slowly, but there are plenty of free programs out there for copying. I have purchased other Roxio products for PC  in the past and none of them worked as advertised, but I was hopeful that the Mac product might work better. Not so. I'm through with Roxio.  I have never posted a negative review on a product in the past, but this one is so egregiously crappy that I couldn't keep it to myself."
0,Can't seem to remember my Bank Account?  Bank America Quicken or Bank America All Other States????
1,"Easy to use. Reliable, have been using this for a couple of years and has been accurate all these years."
0,"I knew this tax year was going to be more difficult than our plain-vanilla returns in the past, with some self-employment, income in two states, etc.  I assumed that even the worst tax preparation software would compensate.  I was wrong.<br /><br />The biggest problem was that it took me hours, literally hours, to convince the software that my wife was the one with the self-employment income and not me.  Granted, I liked the immediate result (larger refund due to self-employment tax), but not the ultimate end result (audit, penalties, interest).<br /><br />There is truly nothing intuitive about this program.  I ended up having to search for form after form because the software was incapable of either automatically completing the form or doing so accurately.  I buy tax software because I don't want to be mired down in the weeds on tax forms.  Which is also why I vote Republican.  Neither the software nor the Republicans seem to be working out this year.<br /><br />There is a reason H&R Block is cheaper than Turbotax, and it's not because Turbotax is overpriced.  This is the first, and last, time I will use H&R Block's software.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you are going to offer to e-file a state return for $19.95, you could at least have the decency to tell people they could do it for free themselves.  This is a criticism I have of both Turbotax and H&R Block, at least when it comes to Ohio, which has about the easiest e-filing system imaginable."
0,"slowed down my computer and even with an uninstaller had trouble getting rid of it, avoid."
0,"Intuit, I will fill out forms manually before rewarding you for gouging your customers. I promise you one thing. You will pay for this dearly. You probably already have. I'm another TT user of 12 years that you just lost. Perhaps forever."
0,I was required to &#34;upgrade&#34; or lose the capability to connect with my bank for online transactions.  Took over<br />three hours to install with tech support.  Does not work as well as previous version.  Would not recommend .
0,So far it has done what I initially needed it to do.  Have to experiment with it more to give an honest evaluation.
1,"This program is very good, has found multiple viruses and has removed them effectively. The fact I can run the program while playing games semelessly, is very comforting. Highey rerecommend this product to anyone."
0,The product itself is an awesome one but make sure never need support for it. I tried to use the hosting package associated with it and after spending 1 hr. on the phone with the UK technical support who informed me that they did not own their server - Amazon did and the issue was on the Amazon side. He had done just about all he could do at this time.  I needed the site loaded for a presentation and he claimed it had affected a handful of folks and so I asked for Customer Service to be switched servers. My call was escalated to a Customer Service manager called Steve who told me that the issue was not unique to me and Serif was not to be held accountable. I asked if notifying their customers would not have been a proactive move on their part to diffuse frustration. His response was that he was too low on the food chain to address that issue.   I asked what compensation was going to be allotted to customers as a result of this inconvenience. He stated I was totally unaware of how the corporate world operated and that Technical dept. handled Customer related issues. He transferred me to the Technical department and I got tired of holding after 30mins and hung up. My issue is still unresolved and I am moving my site to another host partner so Good Luck.
0,Piece of garbage. I spent 1.5 hours online with quicken trying to get my 2012 version data file into 2014. No dice. They don't know what they are doing. I am requesting a refund. How can this be so bad. I've been using Quicken for almost 20 years!
1,"If you're looking for an excellent product for home use (and I mean if you don't own a small business), then this is the product for you.  This specific software had everything that an average person will need for filing their taxes.    Don't be scared of all the negative reviews, the people who posted them should probably have read the description of the item prior to purchasing it.  It is clearly labeled with the features contained in the software.  To say that the product is misleading or not good because they failed to due their due diligence is incorrect.  Take the time and review what you are purchasing before you purchase it.    Again, this is the same, solid, well made TurboTax product as it has always been, just packaged with different features than it previously was."
1,This product has always worked perfectly for me over the last 6-7 years I've used it.  Finds all the deductions I can take and makes sure there are no errors. their work sheet for advising the value of good donated can't be beat.  Has really been very beneficial to us.  Great product!!
0,Who knew Microsoft would be publishing new Office Software so soon?  I didn't!
1,Avast has done what it said it would do. The free version is all the computer tech said I needed..
0,"I am self-employed and bought this after spending $900 on tax prep the previous year. I consider myself reasonably intelligent, but this program drove me nuts and I ended up finding a new CPA after struggling with it for far too long. My impression is that it tries to appear clever by breaking tax prep down in a certain way and directing you from page to page to guide you through, but I returned to it after putting it down for a month and I had lost all my data and could not retrieve it."
0,I have been a loyal user for 20 years.  Currently I am on 2010 but decided to try 2012.  I am glad that I read the reviews first and only installed it to test prior to updating my current version.  There are few improvements but there are many issues (I tested the latest Q2012 R6 version).<br /><br />The biggest issue I have is with the Budgeting tool.  You can no longer enter a budget for a calendar year - it is a rolling 12 months.  I am unable to use this.<br /><br />I am assuming that Quicken will correct all of the other smaller bugs/ issues but they have not responded that they will be fixing the budgeting issues despite the cries from the customer community.<br /><br />I have requested a refund and am hoping that they correct this in the future.
0,"I'd strongly recommend against purchasing the unlock code from Amazon.  If there are any issues Amazon will not provide any customer support.  I was provided a defective code to download the maps and reported the issues immediately via both Chat and e-mail.  Chat was a useless exercise dealing with service personnel who were clearly outsourced to another continent.  E-mail resulted in referring me to Garmin to solve my problem - a total failure of customer service with no recourse for the customer.  When I requested specific support, I received a generic brush-off message from Alex R. stating: \\""I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.\\"" Pay the extra $5 and get it directly from Garmin.  Amazon would rather collect your money and ignore you if there is a problem.   Won't be using Amazon as my first choice for anything anymore after this fiasco."
1,"This may not be as sophisticated a program as the \\""professional\\"" versions, but for my purposes it's been great.  It's easy to get started, and the instructional videos are very clear - although I actually didn't need to watch most of them. The 2-d floor plan view works smoothly - and the \\""dollhouse\\"" view is a good way to check if the flat floor plan really makes sense. Zooming and tilting only took a few minutes to master. You can add furniture and fixtures, and you can easily re-size them to match your own furniture - this was important to me, as I'm planning a smaller house to down-size into, so I have existing furniture that needs to fit. You get an automatic measurement as you draw walls, plus you can toggle exterior or interior dimensions, in metric or ASE units.  It won't let you overlap pieces of cabinetry or furniture, so you can't inadvertently mash things together. However, when moving furniture around, you do have to sometimes move another piece \\""out of the way\\"" - a touch of realism that perhaps could be done without.  Walls, doors, and windows can be added as default versions or customized. There's a library of furniture, appliances, and fixtures, and a large selection of materials and colors to apply. Once you have a design going, it will even give you a cost estimate if you plug in prices for materials.  So far it has not crashed or frozen on me - I can switch among different views quickly. My only problem so far is that the terrain function was hard to understand - thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.   This program most likely wouldn't satisfy the professional architect or contractor, but in terms of being able to produce a floor plan that I can tinker with, and print out to take to my contractor, I like it very well. It's fun to work with - as addictive as any game. A good value for the price."
1,I am beyond pleased with Avast! I never worry about &#34;bugs&#34; and love the fact that there are always updates to keep my computer &#34;clean!&#34;  Thank you Avast for being my guardian angel!
0,"I was completely new to Adobe Illustrator. I thought this would be a good &#34;hobby&#34; project. I bought this and a book and studied and did the exercises in the book and watched lots of YouTube videos and everything was great. I learned all the basics and even some of the advanced stuff. Problem is, after a few weeks, I had no ideas or projects of my own to use this software for. I don't need it for my job and there was just nothing in my life that I needed this software for. I thought I could make my own Christmas cards with it, but I couldn't come up with any ideas for cards. The problem is, without someone else telling me what to make (the study book), I have no ideas or concepts of me own, as I'm evidently just not that creative of a person. Due to the subscription service, now I am stuck paying for something for a year that I have not used since October and probably won't use again.<br /><br />So, my one star rating is for the way they are making people purchase their software. If I had bought this outright, I could at least sell it as used and get some of my money back. If they didn't require one year commitments, I could at least cancel it and not pay for something I'm not using. The way Adobe is selling this software has NO benefit to the consumer customer at all!"
1,"You won't go wrong with this will making kit.  I used it for my personal will as well as drafting a POA to perform a vehicle transaction.  In fact, I created my draft will that was part of my final project for my Wills, Trusts and Estate class and received an A from my teacher, who is an estate attorney.  Need I say more?"
1,"Just purchased version 2 of this software, and I like it.  I do a lot of photo editing in various areas (web development, slideshows, portrait enhancements, etc.), and I have a large number of the higher end photo apps.  But this one is fast, does what it says on the box very well, light on system resources, and does most (if not all) of what the average home user would want to do.  All at a great price.<br /><br />If you're a pro photographer you'll likely want more features, but even then this a great app to have in the toolbox.  And for those who would compare it to something like PhotoShop, you do have to look at the difference in price and the target audience..."
1,"I have used Quicken since its inception in the early 1990s (does anyone remember DOS?). Each subsequent update makes the program easier and more comprehensive, and is extremely helpful at tax time."
1,"The upgrade to 2014 went smoothly from 2013 Premier version.  That was painless.  However, I did encounter issues with the PRICE UPDATE functionality.  At times it will shut down Quicken 2014 and generate an error report.<br />Hopefully Quicken will get a grip on the fix for this error and correct it."

You have to push yourself by using flashcards or multiple choice questions like Memorang has to offer.  If you are the type that is just so focused on only using FA, then don't sweat, everything that is in FA is in Memorang plus a little more to help you understand difficult concepts."
1,Always a fantastic option to take advantage of - keep it going.
1,Avast does a good job protecting against computer virus.

1,I love the simplicity and ease of using TurboTax.  I bought the basic version because I live in the great state of Texas and we have no state income tax.  I've been using TurboTax for 17 years and it is so intuitive to use and includes electronic filing with the IRS.
0,"absolute waste of $10, no templates and just online available clip-art"
1,Great with step by step directions with explanations. No need to be an accountant to file your taxes.
1,Works great
1,easy to install. easy to use. would prchase again next year.
0,"Had issues with the download, then accessing it with code. I finally asked for a refund. Before receiving refund I tried one last download and it worked. Saw many reviews of others having same problem. It's been almost a year since I bought this but I clearly remember it ( and recorded my frustrations in my tax file) and I'm hoping I won't have the same issues this year."
0,"I went to H&R because of Intuit's dirty tricks on pricing.<br />I found H&R Premium clumsy and hard to navigate.  This product would probably be fine for someone with a less complicated life than mine.<br />Examples:<br />1) Import from last years Turbo Tax, did not bring along depreciation method and history info on rental properties.<br />2) I like to use the software to document every significant entry, I create a backup list with check dates, check #, amount as detail-list.<br />H&R supports this, although poorly, H&R keeps these detail backup documents by form-line-number.  If you have more than one copy of any form, H&R presents a list of all the lists by form-line-number, you have to guess which form ( which property ) each list supports.  When you open one of these lists to see what it contains, H&R switches the focus to whatever property that list references. The dilemma is that on many screens there is no on-screen indication of with which property you are currently working; when you select the wrong list you are unknowingly switched to a different property.  Makes for a mess.<br />I finally got fed up and bought Turbo tax Premier anyway!"
1,We have been satisfactorily using this software for years. We tried another a couple of years back but were disappointed. We used to do our own taxes but this software always does a superlative job.
0,"I bought this because it was less than half the price of Norton, but I know I'll be getting Norton after all. I bought the McAfee for my desktop and for my laptop. After I downloaded and installed it on both, in addition it kept installing McAfee Siteadvisor, which messed up both my computers so bad that it took over an hour and a half to run a quick scan on them, besides other slowness and browser crashing problems it caused. So I uninstalled Siteadvisor on both computers, and they were still messed up until I went back to a windows recovery point before Siteadvisor was installed on both computers to get them to work well again. I'll never buy anything from McAfee again after this terrible experience."
1,I use this program to create Space artwork from scratch. It works like a charm.  Great tool for an up and coming artist.
1,Excellent product! Easy to use and worked first time and as it says on the box.<br />Bought  it to capture online educational streamed videos and it worked first time to my great relief!! Quality was excellent after initial teething problem with sound and video non-alignment but this was sorted out after downloading an update from another site as recommended by  online support. Online support was also very good.<br />Other features yet to be tested out including saving it captured files in mobile devices format which will come in very useful; for example I am learning the tenor part of a piece of music and won't mind rehearsing in the head while commuting and this will surely make it easy as &#34;do re mi&#34;.. nit the learning bit but the  software use. Wonder if  I can use the software to put music to holiday pictures?<br />5 stars all round.
1,I picked this up because I had been using Picasa to do my photo editing and storage and wanted to up the ante a bit. Lightroom is an excellent piece of software for organizing and editing your photos. The learning curve is not that steep and Adobe has quite a few tutorials if you are not familiar with Lightroom and just starting out.
0,"I don't dislike this software as much as I dislike Corel's support for it. I decided to purchase Corel Office initially because it was MS Office compatible and light on hardware resources. I purchased the retail box that contained the program on a USB drive. Unfortunately, none of my computers would recognize the USB drive, so the program couldn't be installed. I then downloaded the product from Corel's website as a trial version. When Corel's download finished installing, it asked me for a serial number to activate the full product. I entered the serial number from the USB version I purchased and was informed that the serial number was invalid. I emailed Corel support and after several days I finally got a response. After furnishing proof of purchase for the USB version, I was given a replacement serial number. The program worked fine, given its limitations. Then, after having to reinstall the program twice, because of a Windows upgrade and a computer operating system crash, I ran out of installs for the program. Corel will not authorize additional installs without purchasing extended support, which has to be purchased online and without benefit of a &#34;human&#34; representative, and there is no support number you can call to ask for a &#34;favor&#34; just so you can use the program you purchased. You get three installs and you're out of luck if you need more. So, I have a perfectly useless program. If you decide to buy Corel Office, just be aware of the three installs rule. Extended support will cost you more than program. Good luck."
1,Purchased the Internet Security package 2014 last year and this product replaces it. It was a great sale price so I bought it instead of extending the subscription. Installs quick and uninstalls the old product automatically. Good for 5 devices. Does not slow down the system at all. A+
1,I've been using this program (version 4) since September 2013. It has made me hyper-aware of where all of my money is going and I'm well on my way to getting out of debt. I'm not sure why these reviews are so negative. I find the software extermely flexible in being able to adjust budgets on the fly and the mobile apps (free) work great for entering transactions as they happen.<br /><br />I would definitely suggest watching their videos on the YNAB website or YouTube channel to get a good idea on how to use the program. Take heed that this program is not magic. It will not create a budget for you and automatically make you save money. That all takes work. The software just makes it a lot easier than say an Excel spreadsheet. And the videos they provide are top notch in teaching you the budgeting method.
1,"It works fine, but I do not see any significant improvements over Quicken 2014."
1,Have used TurboTax for 5 years and love the simplicity.
0,"What can you say about something that's free!  What I can say about their tech support is that I came away thinking that the first person was USELESS...So He said  I needed to talk to an engineer, when I asked for a quote as to How Much His Help would be I was told $400.00. This is the same kind of SCAM all these Indian techs are involved in. Oh! I can't help you so fork over the Dollars, and maybe the other guy can fix you Ha !"
1,"I upgraded from 2011 reluctantly because I had seen some of the negative reviews. I was quite relieved when all went off without a hitch, and I moved seamlessly to 2014, scarcely noticing much difference. Since I downloaded, the program has upgraded itself several times, refining and resolving minor issues. I like that. I love Quicken. I have used it for many years and don't know how I could get along without it."
0,It does not allow you to email the form for an extension.  Gives convoluted instructors for printing and snail mail!
1,This thing is light.  I can not tell a slow down on my rig.  Others I have had have slowed me down to the point of removing them before the year was out.  It has easy settings and on the first scan it found one that I thought another antivirus had removed but it missed parts of it.  So far I am happy with it
0,"This software was so frustrating to use!  I paid the fee, upfront, to get access and enter all my info, with the intent to file online.  But, I ended up doing a manual return and losing out on the fee I'd paid because the program was too time consuming and frustrating.  First, you can't get a look at the 'big picture,' as you fill out the forms.  You can only see the Taxact pages, with their boxes for entries.  If you want to preview a pdf of the whole form, as you go, you have to pay extra.  Second, it would timeout and log me off, again and again, even though a pop up would appear and let me say that I wanted to stay logged on.  Then, I'd have to go back to the beginning. which was the worst part, because about half the time it would drop my info and give me all blank screens.  The first time that happened, I emailed for support, but I never received a reply.  At the end, you can get a pdf of the completed 1040, but not of any of the schedules - again. that's an extra fee.  I finally got so annoyed and spent so much time that I just deleted my entries and filed without any software.  I would not recommend Taxact!"
1,Norton constantly tries to slip in weird items whenever I download updates. Not cool. Norton can eat Avast's shorts! Woohoo!
1,Fast service
0,"To charge me $30 more than I paid last year for Schedule D has put TT on my Do Not Buy List. If you want more of my money this year than you took last year, the best way to do that is to add function.......not take it away. I will never purchase TT again and will over the next several months look for an alternative to Quicken. Intuit's arrogance has cost them a loyal many-year customer."
0,"As it turns, Quicken will not accept the file format (.qif) that PayPal exports its data in.  PayPal is currently one of the largest companies in the world handling financial transactions and Quicken, for whatever reason, has chosen not to add a file conversion pathway that is in any way usable.  We have spent two full days with the Intuit/Quicken tech support people, have had multiple interactions with several workers and in each case have received different and ultimately dead end advice.  Looks like we will have to abandon the program and purchase something else for our small business/home bookkeeping.  If you want to transfer PayPal records to your accounting STAY AWAY FROM QUICKEN!"
1,"I have been using this program for years. I have subscribed to the pro version for the last 2 years.<br />Advanced System is now ASC 8 not 7.<br />Advanced System Care Pro (or the free version) is a stand alone program. But there are also downloadable (free) add ons that are useful to excellent. These add ons are downloadable through ASC.<br />Some observations I will share.<br />(1) Considering the entire program and all the bits and pieces its a great program with some serious reservations.<br />Its a great program for the everyday computer user to clean up the computer in one step/operation.<br />It does do a great job cleaning up system files. Never had an issue causing system problems from using it.<br />But my reservations:<br />(1) It seems that iObit is always trying to add programs. Programs like their Malware fighter, which I find next to worthless as compared to Malwarebytes. You have to be careful as these programs will slip on to the computer. Now these programs are NOT bad per say and can be very helpful. Driver Booster is an example of an outstanding add on  program  to update all your drivers. I highly recommend this program.<br />(2)  But the issue I have is that some of these programs  want to run in the background. There is no real need for this. It will just slow down the computer, especially if you are doing intensive demands on it. The faster the processer/ more Ram  the less of a problem this is.<br />You will need to turn these programs off under settings on each of them, You have to uncheck &#34;load at system start up&#34; so they do not boot up initially. You will also have to turn them off after use. Especially if you do not reboot your computer daily.<br /><br />I would have no problem with awarding 5 stars if these 2 issues were addressed by iObit.<br />(1) Do not run on start up is the default settings. The user can turn on if they choose.<br />  Actually Norton 360 and Malwarebytes are the only programs that I run in the background.<br />(2) Stop the add on programs without full disclosure, such as a pop up, asking the customer if they want to add this program to their computer.<br />  Saying downloading is not enough.  They can always be deleted thru  add/ remove programs or programs and features (windows 10).<br /> These programs running in the background, especially all the add on programs can slow your computer down.<br /><br />That said I do like ASC 8 a lot. But It does take some persistence to stay on top of these two issues. A novice might have problems with these items.  If you land up with all these add ons running in the background it could slow things down."
1,very good product...nice Price...I am glad...thanks !
0,"Amazon purchase on 11/28/2013.<br /><br />Prior versions of Premiere Elements allowed you to edit out several sections of a video at once. Elements 12 requires you to split the video into sections, trim off the end you don’t want and then rejoin these pieces. So now it requires a lot more effort to edit multiple sections of a video.<br /><br />But my main problem with Premiere Elements 12 is that it does not offer a output format that matches the resolution and file format of your original file. I download videos and perform screen captures of videos on a regular basis which I then edit out the clips I wish to keep.  Prior versions of Premiere Elements required you to specify your video file format, resolution, frame rate, etc. before you even import the file into the program. How would I know this information and why would I care? So it is an improvement that you don’t have to specify this info before importing the file but the program still requires that you specify all this when you try to save your edited file. You choose the wrong format and your file size jumps 10 fold and takes forever to render.<br /><br />NCH Video Pad Editor file output has as a “Detect” selection which brilliantly matches your input file resolution and frame rate but unfortunately does not match your file format type.<br /><br />So I am looking for suggestions from my fellow Amazonite’s as to a video editor that:<br /><br />1) the import file function detects and matches the file resolution, frame rate and file format type of the original file<br /><br />2) allows editing in the same resolution, frame rate and file format as the original file<br /><br />3) has as an export file format selection that matches the original resolution, frame rate and file format.<br /><br />4) the editor allows editing out multiple clips on one time line.<br /><br />I do not want to use a video converter before or after editing as that again creates the problem of selecting the proper resolution, frame rate, file format, etc. and most likely increase the file size and decrease the video quality."
1,"Good price, and made for an efficient return.  Easy to follow interview.  The quickest return I've ever done.  Only printed what I wanted."
0,I installed this product to edit some photos and it seemed to be working OK but when I closed it it disappeared from my harddrive! I then re-installed it and the same thing happened again. Fortunately the edited photos I had created did NOT disappear but I had asked that they be saved as JPEG photos and when I looked at them Windows would NOT recognize them as JPEG photos although I could view them with the Windows viewer. Very strange.
0,"Every time I do an up grade (and only when Intuit threatens to cut off my on-line banking) , I have nothing but problems.  I have 8 online accounts and I have to fix all of them. I will be the next 3 days getting this up-grade to balance my accounts where they should be.  I had all accounts up to date and backed up before initiating the upgrade.  It took my files and changed the format to the 2014 version and screwed it all up.  If I were not using the on-line banking, I sure would not purchase this 2014 version.  ITS JUNK"
1,"TurboTax, year after year, without fail, has been the easiest way to do our taxes.  It just works, plain and simple. It doesn't get any easier than this."
1,"I recently purchased Quicken 2015 for Mac, an up grade from my previous version.  I love the enhancements made.  All of them.  You just have to try it to see.  And, not only the big changes but the little ones as well.  Excellent job."
0,Din not competely oad because of a deeply imbedded virus. It id not id the file or offer suggestions for a fix . A lesson learne.  Avast basic at least is prote ting from further damage.
0,"When I download transactions from the US Bank Credit card account, it downloads duplicate transactions. I contacted Quicken tech support numerous times and they said it will be fixed soon. It has been more than six weeks and it is still not fixed. Very disappointed."
0,Needs to be more user friendly.  I jumped back into MapQuest when I needed to.  Used with the dash GPS as a supplement worked well.
0,"Quicken 2014 Deluxe has got to be the buggiest version of Quicken I have ever used.  It's fat, slow, suffers from feature bloat, and is plagued with usability issues.  Every patch they release only seems to make things worse,  where the R5 update still has keyboard focus loss issues.  You'll just be typing away and suddenly find an input field in the check register no longer has focus,  and god help you if you try to ALT+TAB to a browser window, copy some text, then ALT+TAB back to Quicken and try to paste.  Quicken completely loses it's mind afterwards and nothing sees to have focus, other than the main Quicken Windows. Clicking a check register field to regain focus is really slow and sometimes takes multiple mouse clicks.<br /><br />If you install the latest R6 update,  you'll find that any 'transfer' you manually enter in your check register will disappear from the register once you hit 'save' (and good luck hitting Ctrl+ENTER to save, it sometimes works, sometimes doesn't).  However, the transaction will show up in the receiving account,  you just can't see it any more in your check register.  The total dollar amount in the check register is reduced,  but the transaction is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />I had to uninstall Quicken, reinstall,  then cancel when prompted to apply updates to get my Quicken back to a usable state (which still suffers from keyboard navigation and focus issues).<br /><br />You now also have the exquisite little convenience of having to create a login for an 'Intuit ID'  before you can download your banking data from your financial institution.  Plus,  you _still_ have to supply a password for your bank prior to attempting to download data.  I presume the Intuit ID login is so that they can always sniff \\""non personally identifiable data\\"" every time you sync up with your financial institutions...<br /><br />I've used quicken for 15+ years,  but I'm looking to dump it ASAP.  In particular,  I'm reviewing GnuCash (wwwDOTgnucashDOTorg) which is a free, open-source alternative financial management program available on Windows XP/Vista/7/8, Mac OS X, and most Linux distributions.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and avoid Quicken like the plague..."
0,"The software is hard to use and doesn't track loans automatically. Also, if you do buy, get it off the shelf from a reputable place. I bought this as an electronic download and tried to return it and it seems I'm out my $75. I followed the instructions to return it and they simply ignore my emails or tell me to be patient (more then 45 days).    I won't ever buy anything from this company again."
1,"I wasn't even looking for this product, but the moment I found it I knew it's what I've been needing for years.<br /><br />Chronicle is so elegant in its simplicity, yet it gives me the information I need with no wading through (as one apples/oranges example) Quickbooks labyrinthine system. I'm just done with Intuit's klunky software anyway, but to find this useful little gem in a sea of other options was truly a gift."
1,"We use Xara Designer Pro as a book layout and cover-art tool. For page layout, it beats Illustrator and Photoshop - but also beats InDesign. We still use Photoshop for text styles and background eraser tool - as those two things don't really exist very well in Xara. Even though Xara can do PDF combines, etc. - we still combine our PDF documents in Acrobat Pro, as well as do PDFX conversions. The new Xara Designer Pro 9 has the ability to export PDFX files, but I have had trouble getting our printer to accept the files. Therefore, we always export PDF-A from Xara and then convert to PDF-X from within Acrobat.<br /><br />Overall, it's  a very nice piece of software, and a must for any graphics or layout artist."
1,I upgrade about every 2 years and I love the improvements and the new remote features.  I purchased this one to pass the torch to my now adult son and have been teaching him how to use it to manage his budgets and assets.  He is amazed and loves it.
1,"I was in a panic.  I had an excel spreadsheet that I emailed from my work computer to my home computer, but the format was going from a newer version  (work) to a older computer (home) with an older version of excel.  I already downloaded the patch, but that didn't work.  As a last ditch effort, I read the reviews for OpenOffice and that it could open excel files, so I gave it a shot.  I was very pleased when OpenOffice was able to open my file, no problem.  The look of OpenOffice is different, but not so that I couldn't figure out the style.  It did take a long time for the file to open, but I think it was because OpenOffice was in the process of converting it to their language and the file is HUGE.  I'm not a techie person, so I could be wrong, but once it opened, I saved my excel file under an OpenOffice file and opened it again to see if it would take as long to open and to my surprise, it opened right away.  This was all I've done in OpenOffice, but I plan on using it more in the future."
1,"This is the best money I have ever spent on a workout program. She tells you what to expect during the workout, how to adjust the moves to your level, and provides a clear view of her doing the exercises with you. It is so easy to adjust it to your workout level.<br />  In 4 weeks I have increased my strength and endurance.  I exercise in a small area of my living room, and I am sweating by the time I am done. I feel really good about my workouts. It is like having a personal coach, who comes into your living room, encourages you and makes you push yourself to get in shape.  The variety and challenge is what keeps me committed to doing this. Also, I tell myself you can do 30 minutes...just hit start and France will keep me motivated!"
1,"It is now several years that I use TurboTax --always with no problems. Few years ago, because I changed the mix of my investments and the taxes increased, I checked the TurboTax results with those arrived by a professional tax accountant ---the two results were within few dollars."
0,"I have been using a Printmaster version from 2003 and I have always loved it.  My new computer did not have it and I had no access to the the discs, so I finally decided to purchase the new and \\""updated\\"" version online.  What a joke!  Antiquated, written much in computer code and not consumer friendly.  If it does as much as the old version, I cannot figure out how.  Impossible to do even the simplest of tasks I did in old.  This program is horribly outdated and looks as if it was created by a sole computer geek rather than a respected company.  I wish I had read reviews first!  I am going to try to get my money back.  So disappointing--- Printmaster used to be so good!"
0,Downloaded the Mac Version when I only own a PC. Downloaded the wrong version for my computer so I could not use it.
0,"Waste of money, I do not recommend. Software does not sync and update balances correctly. Very cumbersome and aggravating to navigate."
1,"Yes, prefer it to more expensive Turbo Tax. Sometimes have to be creative to get it to do what you want but that is more a consequence of our diabolical tax rules than the software."
1,I have used Turbotax for over 5 years now. I find it easy to use and accurate. I will buy Turbotax again next year.
0,"This product should have never been released especially for the price.  While money management software in general has become sparse on the MAC side, there are still some better alternatives.  Having basic missing features (like loan amortization) at its inception doesn't help.  Quicken provides users an option to vote on what features they would like to see on upcoming releases, but honestly, users shouldn't have to wait weeks or months to find out what features may potentially be offered when those same features are already offered in less expensive alternatives.  Quicken for Windows is definitely king.  But Quicken for Mac is definitely the opposite to that.  And to avoid having to use virtualization software to use Quicken for Windows, I'd rather find a different software package that is more native to the Mac OS."
0,Turbo Tax is a great product I use it all of the time for tax purposes.  I am please with this product from Amazon.
1,Good price and no real issues so far.
0,"Like many others, I upgraded from the 2009 version to continue to be able to download bank updates, etc. I do not use the budgeting section, so can't verify the problems. Other than a couple of tweeks and some cosmetic changes, the program has just about the same functionality as the 2009 version. Certainly NOT worth the cost of upgrade, except to be able to continue to download updates. The 'requirement' to upgrade every three years is nothing more than Intuit ripping us off. There is nothing in Quicken 2012 that would entice me to upgrade, other than being able to download updates. I am also tired of getting not-so-special offers from Intuit (credit cards, loans, etc.). At least the price on Amazon is cheaper than on the Intuit web site."
1,"ive used many different brands of antivirus, and have been relying on avast for the last 4 years without an incident"
1,I have used H&R Block for a few years now.  It is simple to use and I trust the results.
1,Great as usual
0,Why would you have one without state taxes too?  I inadvertenly clicked this one and now I have to spend another $40 to file my state returns.<br /><br />So Bummed.
1,"I've not been able to find any of the bugs or problems indicated during other user reviews from December 2012 time frame. The data on my phone/tablet/pc all synchronize without issues.<br /><br />WHAT IT NEEDS:<br />If the mobile [Android] app allowed you to take pictures of your receipts. This would allow me to enter a transaction and attach my receipt to upload/synchronize with my Desktop software.<br /><br />Currently I have to rely on using the Android App \\""Cam Scanner\\"" to create receipt images on the go, or when home I have to use my print/scanner. If Intuit added this feature it would skip a lot of steps for their users.<br /><br />Overall, very happy so far."
1,"Great software at a great price. Was my first time using H&R block and it was just as easy as Turbo Tax. I was a loyal user of turbo tax but always felt the price was kind of high for the software, so this year I decided to give HR block  a chance. The price was right for my budget.  Will be using it for now on."
1,Love these programs. I use it for work and play. My laptop would be worthless without it. I love that it's compatable with Windows as well. 5 stars!
1,"Enhances performance somewhat, but has REALLY annoying pop-ups telling you how much time is left on trial. They should chill that a bit!"
0,"I guess what makes me really mad is that I almost used this product to try to complete my 2014 taxes. I would have been really surprised when I could not complete all my forms. I usually wait very late in the tax season to do my  taxes. You cannot estimate my anger at this change with no notification. It's  one thing to raise the price of your product and let it compete in the market place. It is completely different to dumb down your product and sell it as the same thing. Whoever thought of this marketing scheme is an idiot and should be fired. At the least, the new product should be called by a different name like TurboTax Light with reduced features but not TurboTax Deluxe."
1,I love Avast. It tells me when they have blocked something unusual when it comes up for downloading and it tells me it is  always checking for viruses.
1,"The product is everything I expected, both good and bad.  I am less than in love with Windows 8 and this latest version of office is designed to run in concert with it.  The Office tools interact and behave as they were designed.  Finding things as I transition from older editions of office is still a challenge.  I've had the product for about 2 months and have had little exposure time - thus I am hopeful I will become more comfortable with this office suite over time.<br /><br />The (1 PC/1 User download) mechanism was easy to use.  The installation was quick and easy, with no identifiable problems."
0,"Really regret not using the free trial because this is just for common fixes. Blurriness, exposure fixture, cropping etc. If you want creativity you probably need the other photoshop. I definately do but now have to wait since splurging on this simple quick fix. :("
1,Does the job so far....normally use Norton but newest computer came with McAfee so stayed with McAfee when the first year expired. See no difference between the two so far and McAfee was also cheaper.

0,"Since someone decided to not publish my original review of Quicken Deluxe 2014, I'm editing it out entirely.  I had posted my experience with the product, the unresolved issues with online banking and a comparison of my experience with Quicken Deluxe 2013 (which did not have the same issues).  I have submitted a refund request for my Quicken 2014 purchase, and, am waiting for the refund."
1,Excellent program-user friendly
1,I have tried other antivirus and they sucked i didnt want to spend the cash cause norton can be so pricey so i went with a cheep brand wish i didnt cause i still got a worm killed my computer had to buy a new one and now 900$ later learned my leason.<br />I will always buy Norton and the down load was easy too.
1,I have been using an older version of Photoshop and Premier Elements and have been having some video editing difficulty.  I decided to upgrade to see if this version would handle video layers better than the older version.  It does and I'm very satisfied.
1,"It feels allot better to see protection when working on the internet at home, work and on the road too."
0,BE CAREFUL!!! It seems THIS version does NOT include the State Program???
1,great
1,I ordered this for my grandchildren age 8 & 11 and they both love it.  Their 4 year old sister is wanting to do it too so I would call it a winner.  All children should learn to type.  This program was easy to download & I really like it.
1,Very good.
1,"After using Microsoft Movie Maker for a couple of years to create just basic videos with photos and music, I was ready to upgrade. I collected videos from my brothers and sisters to make a Christmas video and found that they had sent me different video formats which MS Movie Maker couldn't handle.  After some research, we found the Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite and downloaded the trial version.  I was able to quickly add the videos and the software was able to play all 4 of the varying formats.  I also added photos and music easily, and after a few mistakes, finally found out how to edit the videos and add text and other features.<br />I'm sure I haven't learned everything about this software yet, but so far, I'm very impressed.<br />I would say that for all the most common video editing and creation functions, the software is very intuitive and you can click around and find what you need and how to use it (ie, split the video, add text, fade in/ out) pretty quickly.<br />The only annoyance was the limited Help information that was available.  Most of the more advanced things I needed to edit my video, I had to do either poke around until I found it, or do a Google search to find information on it.<br />For the price, this is a high-quality software with lots of features and functionality.  I can't wait to use it to create my next video!"
0,"I'm giving it one star mainly because of the lousy customer service.  I was trying to capture video from the digital tuner on my HTPC.  It worked fine with PowerDirector 9, but after I upgraded to 13 it kept giving me errors.  I completely uninstalled it twice (using Revo Uninstaller) and re-installed it to no avail.  After two weeks of waiting for a response from their &#34;technical help&#34;, their great idea was to try and capture it with Windows Media Maker and then edit it with PowerDirector.  Well, I didn't pay $100+ and then not have everything work properly.  And it would sure be nice if their &#34;technical help&#34; didn't speak with such bad broken English."
1,"This is my second year using Norton and I am very satisfied with its protection. Although it can slow web browsing down some it is definitely worth it. It has blocked many attacks on my PC. Also, you cannot beat Amazon's price on this product."
1,"I've used Cook'n for a very long time and have been very satisfied with this software. I know that in our fast-paced society many people are very impatient and insist on the immediate resolution of their technical problems.  Cook’n had its share of issues with the entry into the world of &#34;apps&#34; and has responded, in my opinion, in a timely & professional manner.  Are there bad apps out there? Yes!  Is Cook'n one of them? No!<br />I know that we all get angry when a software product does not meet our expectations, but before you write a &#34;1 Star Review&#34;, please consider the fairness of your comments."
1,great
1,Did the job. Very easy to file an amended return. How can you really like anything even remotely associated with income tax.
1,Why mess with something that works?  I've used Norton since the 90's.  It should come with cool utility tools again.
1,"I find Family Tree Maker to be quite useful.  I do use it in conjunction with ancestry.com to manage my family trees for personal genealogy research, but I believe someone would also find it useful without an ancestry subscription.  Some of the features I've found quite useful are the ability to set up filters you can save to search for certain family members and to add your own fields and history notes.  I'm also using FTM to maintain family trees for characters in a novel I am working on.  The fact that I can add historical notes that will then be visible when reviewing specific characters is quite useful.  Some of the filters I've set up are to locate family members who might have been the right age to serve in the military during specific wars from the Revolutionary War to the present.  I've also set up a few to allow me to review deaths during periods when epidemics such as the 1918 flu were rampant in the area where the people live.  In each case, I'm able to produce a list of people then check for details that I might otherwise miss in their histories.  Considering that my main tree, which I began based on extensive research my grandmother started, contains nearly 2000 people, being able to set up such filters and save them is quite convenient.  Since I can add items to the history listings, and they'll show up alongside a person's dates, I can easily look at the individuals to see what kinds of records I might be able to find to support such things as their military service records.  You're also able to add notes on where you left off or what other things you might want to look at next so that, when you have to put down your research for an extended period and pick it up again later, you're able to get back into it without losing too much time figuring out where you were.<br /><br />You're also able to generate quite a few reports, including various standard charts and reports such as the Ahnentafel report, various trees, descendants, etc.  But you also have the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.  There's also an option to create a book based on your work.<br /><br />I've used earlier versions of FTM in the past.  I've been working on genealogy research for more than 20 years, off and on.  I find that the current versions of this software are much improved.  Syncing with Ancestry works well, though I've had a few mishaps when I didn't quite understand how to handle upgrades correctly.  For the most part, the software is pretty intuitive, if you're used to working on genealogy.  It is quite specialized, so someone who is new to genealogy work would really need to look at the manual for guidance when getting started.<br /><br />The software is quite useful and I'd definitely recommend it to others.  Though it does cost more than some genealogy software (I've used many other programs, including shareware and freeware products, as well), I believe you get a good value for the price.the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.

0,"I have been a Microsoft Money user and switched to Quicken 2009 when Microsoft announced they would discontinue Money. While Quicken 2009 was not perfect, it did what it was supposed to do (mostly). Given that I had a large amount of legacy Money data, I decided to try (as in buy) Quicken 2010 mostly for its in-built Money converter. I should have stuck to Quicken 2009 because it has been an incredibly frustrating experience so far.    Every time I tried to open a file, I kept getting the dreaded \\""Quicken Launcher has encountered a problem and needs to close\\"" error making the program virtually un-usable. I got in touch with Quicken support (after a 30 minute wait) who essentially asked me to re-install the software using the QcleanUI method. This seemed to work fine for about 20 minutes. During those 20 minutes that it worked, I figured it would not update some accounts which previously updated without a hitch (in Quicken 2009). I am now back to getting the dreaded quicken launcher error every time I try to open a file.    Bottomline, Quicken 2010 is plain un-usable at this point. Apparently, I cannot get a refund if the product is downloaded via Amazon. So much for 60-day no questions asked money-back guarantee. I hate it when things don't work when they should. Quicken 2010 unfortunately, does not work."
0,"it made me think i wasted $450 on 3d monitor and glasses kit until i uninstalled this program beautiful and functional user interface though, just plays 3d blue-rays like crap.   Sincere apologies to any craps that may have been offended by being compared to Power DVD 14.   Trying to get refund now since Win DVD 11 actuly has good 3d playback"
1,"Great product and works well Zipping and Unzipping files. I rather pay for it, then go download it from some third party sites and get other unwanted freebies (Virus, malware etc...). WinZip 17 Standard [Download] also can be used to share ZIP with Face Book,Dropbox, SkyDrive and Google Drive, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. This is the full version and the winzip website also has a trial version."
1,Made my PC like new!
0,My Cd key for the download will not work :(  Cannot find a way to contact amazon or software company.
0,it was a very difficult process to go to the alternate website and get it to download it would have been easier if it was a point and click at the time of purchase
1,Powerful software at a modest price.
0,"Don't bother.  If you have investments, you need the premier version.  In effect, they have doubled the price.  Forget it."
1,Immed. download. Great product.
1,Easy install and best price.
0,"This was an upgrade from 2012 Norton Antivirus.  The installation is as bad this year as it has been in the past.  You have to totally remove 2012 in order to install 2013 which is a major problem unless you have the Norton removal program.  The program works as expected, but the installation problems are going to cause me to look for a different vendor next December."
0,If you're looking to upgrade to take advantage of the &#34;Free Credit Score&#34; feature - a feature that is placed prominently in the ads - save your money.  It doesn't work.  Message boards have the feature not working for at least the last 4 months with promises of fixes in R3.  R3 doesn't fix it.  Wish I would have looked through the boards prior to sending any $$$ to quicken.  Lesson learned.  Will never upgrade again until I see demonstrations that promised features that are attractive to me work.
1,"We were fed up of suprasavings and the moment avast was downloaded, it was detected and stopped."
1,I have been using H&R Block for years now and have had no issues at all. Great app and is very easy to use and follow along.
0,"I purchased this item to install on my MacPro running OS X Mavericks and to my surprise it would not install because it is not compatible with the operating system. I based my purchase on the  &#34;System Requirements OS: Mac OS X 10.7 and above.&#34;<br />Unfortunately, I did not notice the conflicting statement &#34;Not Currently Compatible Mac OS X 10.9.&#34; Yes, I was careless not noticing that the second statement negated the first... however, I did not expect to be tricked by Amazon into purchasing an outdated version of the software. My experience with Amazon has been outstanding over the years and this one, although technically my fault, it leaves me with a negative feeling. I purchased the latest version directly from the vendor and it installs without any issues. The $26.42 that I payed for the outdated version sold on the Amazon site is a total waste. The least I expect from Amazon is to refund me the $26.42  and the right thing to do is modify the conflicting statements under System Requirements to make it clear that the item is an older version that does not work with the latest version of Mac OS X."
1,I have been using avast for over a year and I couldn't be happier. My son recommended it as he has been installing on clients computers for many years....never any problems!
1,Excellent Antivirus! Easy download and great price. Able to use on 3 PCs. I'm glad I found this on Amazon at a fraction of the cost of the retailer's full price.
1,"Unfortunately I can't be 100% objective with my review because the only other video editing software I've used is Windows Movie Maker. I made a few gameplay/review videos for Youtube with that but I quit for months because it was SO cumbersome, clunky, tedious, and slow. It drove me nuts! I knew I wanted to make videos because I don't know, I like to express myself? But I almost gave up after making 4 or 5 vids using FRAPS to record and Movie Maker to edit because it was SO painful. Yet I kept watching all these cool channels, so jealous how they were cranking out video after video, nice looking ones too. How do they do it?<br /><br />I started doing some research, spent a couple evenings reading reviews, watching some videos, tutorials, etc. and Cyberlink PowerDirector just kind of jumped out at me like it would be exactly what I was looking for. Reviews said it was fast and easy. Right on! So I did it. I took the plunge, it was in my price range, and oh my gosh I love this stuff! I really really do. I've made two videos and uploaded them to Youtube so far since I bought this and wow, it was a snap!<br /><br />Drag and drop, cut and slice, add quick and easy effects, even adding things like censor blurs (people don't need to see my Steam friends or server passwords) is SO easy. Processing videos is easy, there are are tons of formats to choose from, and the quality is fantastic. So yeah, I'm hooked. I seriously can't imagine an easier piece of software if you just want to throw together videos that look nice but don't require digging through hours of tutorials and manuals. I only had to look up how to do one or two things but the rest was so intuitive. It's actually made the process of recording and editing gameplay videos enjoyable! Yeah that's right."
1,Happy with program very unhappy with additional charges to e-file
1,avast! Free does a great job of protecting my PC. I almost never have any of the kinds of malware they promise to protect against. It's hard to complain about a free product that works SO well. I'd recommend it without hesitation.
1,"In the world of hacker, this is my computers ultimate body guard. It was easy to install and easy to use everyday."
1,excellent
1,"excellent, has solved a need for my personal use in"
1,"I've been using the Norton AV app for many years now. Symantec products are the best in my opinion. They've kept all my devices protected flawlessly. Navigation is simple and intuitive. If you should happen to encounter difficulties the Help menus are informative. If you're still feeling perplexed, no need to fret. The Norton Live Support Team is in a class of its own. They will even offer to remotely troubleshoot your issue(s) and relieve you of any anxiety you may have of doing by yourself. It's the only virus app I'll use, and for good reason. It just plain works!"
1,The best Internet security..
1,Process was very simple and a lot easier to navigate than Intuit's. Product was also cheaper here at Amazon. I had an earlier version of Quicken that stopped working but had a lot of information in it. I downloaded 2012 and it recovered everything and started working right away. I haven't had any troubles with it.
1,Very easy to download and install.
1,Turbo tax takes almost all the pain out of doing taxes. It practically takes you by the hand and leads you through the process. I have used it for the past four years and have no intention of changing to another company. It is truly worth the price!
0,Turbo tax still works but seems less intuitive than in past years. It failed to retrieve my personal info from last years file and on opening the option of resuming a return is not immediately apparent. I didn't find the help menus particularly useful. Maybe it's just the nature of the subject but it seems to get progressively more murky and difficult to use. There is a whole screen available why not use it to communicate more effectively?
1,The interface is still not as nice as the PC version (used that for about 10 years) but it is more user friendly than iBank!
1,I have used Quicken for years and this version still does what it is supposed to do. I haven't tried the mobile function so I can't comment on whether that works or no.
1,I have been using Avast for about three years or more. Best free antivirus I ever used.  Helps my computer stay free of viruses!  I Highly recommend it.
1,Been using avast antivirus for many years and it been keeping my information and computer safe and virus free would recommended this to any one who asked!!
0,"Software does what is supposed to do. Did not include Free EFile like All other offers on Groupon, etc."
1,"Even some Mac fans prefer or need to run MS Office applications instead of notes, pages, etc.  College kids appreciate the advanced word process, spreadsheet capabilities.  My kids said this eliminated a few compatibility issues they ran into when doing collaborative projects or emailing assignments to professors.  Seems that on occassion the Mac software or open office isn't fully compatible with MS Office."
0,Norton just didn't do it.  Too many popups got through.  I love PCMATIC.  It really cleans the computer and stops all the nonsense stuff.
1,Served us faithfully for many many years
1,"This File has corrupt data. Unable to load into computer.  Contacted Amazon, Support staff suggested bypass of router.  Direct download via Cable Modem resolved this issue.  Thank you Amazon Support."
1,I use it regularly. I have added recipes with ease. I had a computer problem and the program and data was destroyed. I emailed the support team about it. Within two days they sent me a download that added the program and all of my lost data. Very quick response. I highly recommend this.
1,Great for beginners!
1,First time I used turbo tax.  Found it easy to follow and got back about the same out as I did last year when I paid hundreds for a &#34;professional&#34;
1,"we have used Avast (free download) for years and have found it to be a great protection.  Several times each month we are warned away from a harmful web site, and feel much more protected with this program.  It is easy to use and updates itself each day!!<br />Highly recommended"
1,"Been a while since I've used Photoshop, but so far I have no complaints about Elements 12. I was able to look up some how to videos for Elements 11, and they worked for this version too. Looking forward to learning more, and this version is still newbie friendly! I downloaded this over WiFi, took maybe 4 hours BUT I am in a rural area, so the net is usually slow anyways. Aside from taking about 4 hours, there were no issues with downloading and installing."
1,"The Advanced Systemcare PRo v5 - fixed a lot of problems, but I had a computer full of trash & thousands of problems - I will rate the PRO v5 a Great Start to full repair & to let you know what is wrong with your system<br />(4 STARS of Magic)  Thanks.<br /><br />I paid for the upgrade to the PRO v6 and WOW!!!<br /><br />It Fixed everything, I could Imagine - the upgrade for a year was only $12.00 more -<br /><br />I rate the v6 Excellent (5 STARS TURBO MAGIC)"
0,2014 does not work as described. One Step Update crashes Quicken every time I try. Can't be fixed as of now.
0,Very Buggy. No Support
1,"For those of you that cannot download, clean the malware from your computer free with malwarebytes software. Then you will be good to go.    No problems here, downloaded in 5 minutes, Installed, updated and started the ole' taxes. Running Windows 7.    Great price!"
0,"This review is about the download version I purchased directly from the Microsoft store. Upon entering it, it tells me it is already in use. Wtf!?? Who is using it? Is Microsoft selling pirated copies of their own product?<br /><br />What's worse, when I log into my Microsoft account, I'm told no Office products are associated with it. I'm glad I printed the serial number after I had purchased it.<br /><br />Something smells fishy about this."
1,Always use Turbo Tax.  So easy and helps to get every deduction and a complete tax return.
1,"I never know it's there.  I've never had a problem with it.  The last three security software programs I've purchased have caused nothing but headaches and constant maintenance. This software runs silently and smoothly.  I no longer have performance issues like I had with the others, I no longer have to suspend my entire security just to download and install updates, what a PITA that was.  I love this software.  I hope they don't mess it up like so many others have done with their new and improved versions every year.  New and improved is great as long as it still works like it always did: smoothly and silently!"
1,"I have used Avast for years now.  The thing about Avast is that you can set it and it takes care of everything else.  No need to worry if your computer is being protected against malicious attacks, illegal shut downs or all the other junk that is going on in cyberspace.  Avast is to me, very affordable and no one should be without it.  Give it a try and you will be amazed of all the things Avast can do for your pocket and your computer.<br />Thomas, KY"
1,I like avasts it  has not given me any problems5 stars I would ask all  my friends to try it out.
1,"This is a good product to get your taxes done.  It brings in the information from previous years, and you're able to download documents from various investment institutions. Sometimes the questions that are asked are confusing, but overall - I'm extremely pleased with the software. Please note that you get one free State download, a free e-file for the federal, but you must pay to e-file state taxes."
1,Been useing advast free over 4 yrs never had any problems and was always notified when an attempt was made unto my computer thank you avast
1,"After having avast! Free on my old PC, I decided to continue with it on my new, high-speed Lenovo desktop purchased 2 years ago.  The PC's speed impressed me and as I started spending more time on the Web, I was notified that my Free was expiring and I should purchase the full-coverage model.  Was really disappointed.  During download completion I missed the little box indicating Chrome would be downloaded as well.  Thus began the sluggish behavior of the PC, and strange glitches I didn't appreciate.  I cancelled the full-coverage model, removed Chrome, and retrieved my speed - glitch free.  the Free! version does what I need, however I tried the anti-Grime feature and again was faced with loss of some of the things I had set up as standard operating features.  Went back in time to remove Grime, and now run Free! and am happy.  My guess is that for those who do lots of surfing, lots of connecting to new sites this is not the safest route, but for me it's a good thing."
0,"I have used Quicken continuously since the DOS (1980's) days, and this is the worst one ever for me. First of all, it did now download properly. When I did finally get it to run, it kept wanting my Intuit ID every time I tried one step update. I uninstalled it, then tried to reinstall it...big mistake. I had to contact their help online...talked to someone on the phone from India for three hours over two days to get it up and running again. Essentially very few improvements over my previous 2013 version. Won't update some of my mutual fund prices. Won't include income from a registered retirement fund (RRIF) as income on the home tab, my money. This version was a waste of money. It seems they did not get all the bugs out before trying to sell it. I will not try any new versions unless they have been out for awhile."
0,"I keep getting an error whenever I have a security update on Windows 7. It tell me that I don't have permission to access the folder or drive that this program is on. Funny, since it's on the C: drive and in the same location it was when I last ran it. I've talked to customer service (via chat). They were helpful, but their solution involved running a program that cleaned all traces of previous versions of Quicken from my system. I've been using Quicken for at least 15 years, so that was a lot of cleaning. Fortunately not all 15 years of history are on this hard drive!<br /><br />Once we got that cleared up, it ran great until the next Windows update. Now I'm back to the same problem. My solution... don't close Quicken. I know it's not a solution, but I rely on this program for paying my bills and managing my finances. This is not a program I want to have problems with. It also keeps saying that Quicken doesn't support the \\""run as administrator\\"" and that I should log in as an administrator. Tried that, didn't help. Oh well. I just keep hoping for an update that will fix these bugs! Maybe 2014 will be better...<br /><br />Not impressed with this release at all, but I'm still devoted to Quicken.<br /><br />Update...<br /><br />Still having problems with Quicken 2013. It still refuses to play well with Windows 7 access controls and every time there is a security update to Windows, I have to re-install the software. I'm un-installing it this week and switching to Mint.com. Intuit owns Mint, so they haven't lost me completely."
1,I used to use Quicken years ago and wanted to start managing my finances electronically again. It was very quick and easy to download.
1,I've used Word Perfect since the late 80s.  Reveal Codes is the best!  I simply can't imagine using any other office product.
0,"If you are an XP hanger on, you do not want this years edition. It requires you to activate all the parts of Microsoft that you have grown to hate. Firewall & &#34;ALL&#34; the security updates since man has moved out of caves. What this will do for you is to eat data like it is free, I went over 3GB in the last week of my monthly term so I used 4GB in one week. With the computer turned on and doing nothing, it used 600M on it's own! I have tried to uninstall ALL the updates which made KIS not work at all and my only hope is to reinstall XP or move on to Apple which is the more likely choice. Goodbye Microsoft and goodbye KIS, you did have a good product for many years. One last note, getting help is like trying to swim the Atlantic bleeding profusely. One of the nice bug's in the program adds an unseen character to secure text boxes, thus not allowing you to log in to accounts etc. Tried to contact them, gave up."
0,Do not buy this as a down load.  It may be ok IF  you were to receive a cd.  You have to go to office.com and then get a message your download will start shortly.  It never does.  I want my money back!

1,"Fast, does not degrade Performance. Great security and peace of mind.  Warns before entering a suspicious site!"
1,"Downloading and installing this software was a breeze. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit and did not have any issues. I'm still waiting for the federal government to finalize a form before I can file my return, but I have everything else filled out and ready to go.<br /><br />I thought the software was very easy to use.

1,"I upgraded from Quicken 12, as my bank no longer supported the older version. I downloaded Quicken 15 on 5/1/2015, and still does not work as of 6/3. will not download from bank, can't update or reconcile, all auto entries do not work, etc.etc. I have spent hours with tech, located in Phillipines, it worked one time, on download, but quit. No auto entry as yet. I would like to go back to 12 and just do manual entries, but told I can not do? They have had several patches, downloaded, but NO HELP.

0,"DO NOT BUY, YOU WILL PROBABLY BE RIPPED OFF! --- I figured I have used Office my entire life I would give this program a shot.  In reality the product is actually pretty decent.  Being able to access your files in one central location is obviously a positive.  For me though, that is all this version really offers.  I was more than willing to settle with that, until the customer service.  India.  Of course a billion dollar company outsources their issues to India.  If they were able to fix the problem then sure, I would not mind having to say &#34;excuse me?&#34; or &#34;can you repeat that please?&#34; 57 times in conversations with 4 different people.<br /><br />The issue:  I purchased 360 and I am trying to renew.  When I try to renew the product I went ONLINE and filled out my current account information.  However, it said that my email was not attached to my product key so I was not allowed to renew? HUH??? Getting a little confused I explain to him that the issue is with their sever and if they could just go on their server and get me sorted out then everything would be just great.  He goes through all the BS looking at my diagnostics and says that everything is running perfectly and he said the computer is like new.  Then he says, &#34;The issue is in your computer.  You need pay $239 for technician to go in and fix.  We will fix everything.&#34; WHAT?.. My computer is less than a year old.  I hold in my hand 3 BRAND NEW keys for Office 365 and they are telling me that I need to pay an extra $200 to fix?  Not to mention the issue is ON THEIR SERVER.  It is NOT on my computer! I tried it on three separate computers and it didn't work. His reply &#34;I understand sir, that means that we fix all three computers.&#34; $200 to fix three computers? Lame, but okay may be worth it.  Nope.  Over $700.  I demanded a supervisor.<br /><br />He literally sounded like the EXACT same person.  And what made it seem the same is that he was telling me ALL the exact same stuff.That the issue is on all three of my computers.  I need to pay over $200 a computer to get them fixed so that we can run our brand new software that we recently purchased on our less than a year old computer.  As you could guess, I am now livid.  How do I know more about computer systems that you do?  This is your job.  My job isn't even remotely related to computers so I don't see how I could get this and he could not grasp this basic concept.  All I needed was for them to give me the access I needed to but in my brand new keys into my online account.  These people are literally Microsoft's professionals that are supposed to help us when we have issues.<br /><br />I used to love Microsoft.  I swore by Microsoft.  Then I changed to Mac.  Now back to Microsoft.  I had it right before.  Save yourself the issues, the headache and the money.  Yes Mac's are more expensive, but they are 1000 fold better.  I have had the same mac for the past 6 years with zero issues.  However, if you do have issues you go to the genius bar, FOR FREE.  With people who actually SPEAK ENGLISH and who know what the heck they are doing.  I was wrong to give Microsoft a second chance.  Back to Mac I go... sprinting."
1,Easy to use.  Walks you through the process.  Makes sure you won't get arrested while maximizing your refund.  And it is a lot cheaper than the competition.  I've been using it for years and will keep on going.
1,"So far everything is as great as it was with Norton 360.  I haven't noticed any problems.  Also, the download worked perfectly first time thru.  I have windown 7 on an HP desktop.  I will do this next year if I am sent a notice of the one day sale on this.  I have no complaints so far and the price was right.  Again, it took off my Norton 360 and loaded this with NO problems.  Good buy!!!"
1,"I had a subscription, but Norton wanted $50 more for an auto-upgrade than Amazon so I downloaded.  The trouble came when I the install did not ask for the key and would not activate to replace the old product.  By trial and error I found that there is a place under \\""Support\\"" on the main Norton Internet Security screen to enter the key.  Worked fine then, but it could have been documented somewhere."
0,"This product is terrible.  It was difficult to figure out how to create the business card, and after I finally did, I couldn't print it!  I tried everything.  It would only print full page (letter) size.  I tried changing the size every way I possibly could with the software as well as my printer.  Nothing worked. I wish I would have read the reviews here first."
0,"I have been using Quicken for decades. It isn't great but it allows me to track my accounts and helps me do my taxes.<br />The basic deal is you have to upgrade every three years, which is okay. So I had Quicken Premiere 2012 and it is time to upgrade to<br />2015, fine. I tried it a few months ago, it was broken and I got my money refunded from Intuit. But then I was trying to print out my tax summary data for 2014, well on the 3 year rule, Q 2012 won't print tax data for 2014. Okay, so I bought it again. I tried to buy direct from Intuit (50% discount, about the same as Amazon). Didn't work. Okay wanted to get started on my taxes, so I bought it from Amazon. Installed, converts qdata file to 2015 format and then bang, won't allow you to register the product. I tried with my old ID<br />no go, tried making a new ID no go. Okay who needs to register? Nope it won't let you open the converted file. Now I'm stuck and SOL."
1,"BEST alternative to the high end Adobe product and light years easier, more capable and more intuitive than any of the 5 Premier Elements versions I tried out.  Similar in capability to Corel's X7, but is more intuitive than the X7."
0,"I first thought this was great solution but I didn't see real results until I purchase the product and started really using it.  It doesn't convert image correctly, and I wasn't able to make the changes that I need to the PDF document."
1,It tells me daily that it has stopped a virus or malware.  Very happy with it.
1,"have been using it for years, no complaint, with one exception.  Too many promotional emails, i.e., junk mail, from Norton."
0,"I am not impressed.  This was a complete pain to get installed.  Because I could not get it installed last year on windows 7 64 bit, and all the reviews are saying the same about this version, I didn't even try.<br /><br />On XP 32 bit the installation file just blew up.  I had to download a third party unzipping tool to first extract the setup files and then run them by hand.<br /><br />My biggest issue is with their dumb decision to put deduction pro online.  Instead of a local install, it is now a browser application.  I hate browser applications that should be locally run applications.  I know the stupid reasoning is that it is now easier to deploy and that they can now claim to be on the cloud.  That is the same bad logic I fight everyday as a Software Architect.<br /><br />Luckily, these people aren't paying me, so I don't have to stick with there crappy browser application.<br /><br />Good-bye HR Block, hello TurboTax."
1,Love it

1,"This is not the first time I have used TurboTax to do my taxes and, just like the previous years, I was amazed at how thorough the program is and how quick and painless it is to file my taxes!  Will definitely use it again and again and again!!!"
1,"Since upgrading, stock prices download more quickly and I think accurately.  Previously, downloading often failed.  Otherwise there are not a lot of changes"
0,"I am not very pleased with this version as before I was able to at least download the state version and work with my daughters forms or my parents and print them out. This version only allows me to work with one, which is terrible!!!"
0,Do not buy this it does not operate as the desk top version. period.
1,I've been using avastF Free Anitvirus for some time and have had ZERO problems or issues with Win 7 or Win 8.1. Does not slow down my machine but has provided a sense of security for a long time. A great product at a great price...free. Bravo!
0,I signed up for the unlimited trial and the client is down right horrible. The only way to upload files is by dragging them into the client. And thats the ONLY thing the client does is upload. HORRIBLE. I wish I could mount it as a drive or something so I can use something else to sync files into it.
1,"it is unfortunate that turbo tax has removed some functionality from the basic package, and now require some users to buy the premier package to do their taxes.  seems like a money grab to me.<br /><br />fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) i require the premier version anyway.<br /><br />i find turbo tax very easy to use, and have been using it since 2001.  i especially like how it connects to my online fidelity account, and downloads the several pages of stock transactions that need to be reported."
0,This is total junk/trash.  Does not work.  Cannot get it to install and run. Errors after repeated attempts.  I would give it less than one star if possible
0,"I have been using TurboTax Deluxe for years.  This year I used it and tried to transfer my stock/dividend information into it form by broker, and it made me upgrade to TurboTax premier.  There was no additional cost--but is this a tone time thing, or in future years am I going to be forced to buy the more expensive TurboTax premier, because I want to transfer everything from my broker, rather than entering  everything on my own?   Second item--I did my daughter's taxes using TurboTax deluxe--because of what the IRS thought was a security problem last year, they issued her a 6 digit pin code to enter on the return.  No where during the interview process did TurboTax ask if she had this item to enter.  I had to go to the forms and enter it there myself."
1,I have been using turbo tax for years.  It allows you to efile with the state and federal while double checking your information for oversight and mistakes.  Feel confident my taxes are in good hands.
1,"purchased this after being recommended.  The computer is running faster, scams run automatically and inform you of the results. I can also run a scan should I feel it necessary.  It is much simpler than other systems.  I like it"
0,"Decided to try Rollback RX, as W7 System Restore let me down yet again, well specifically, it wouldn't restore.  Only tried RX once so far, but it performed perfectly. Seems straightforward. I love that System Restore is replaced!  June 2015 Update: I've actually uninstalled this as I started getting system crashes. Still love the idea of replacing the Win System Restore but after using this I've realised that you're messing with absolutely low-level system data and I'm not sure I can trust this.  I'd only want to trust this if I had a rock-solid backup in place, and I don't, which is why I was interested in this in the first place.  Downgrade from 5 stars to 2 stars. Maybe it's a great product and my system is unstable, rated at 2 stars to encourage caution."
1,Have used other free antivirus and had problems. Avast free has been great. I would not trade for any other.
1,"I did get a refund, so I guess it was worth it.  I wish I didn't have to file taxes, but since we do, Turbo Tax has always worked well for me."
1,Makes filing taxes so much easier. Have been using TT products since the late 90's
1,I am impressed with the ease and features of this product..I will definitely continue to use TurboTax..
1,Easy to get and use. Very glad I purchased here and I saved $$$ for a product I love to use.
0,An economical alternative to Photoshop Elements-Diversity and surprising quality. A very nice gift . Great Value for Money.Bravo!<br />Will buy again

0,"I would have given it a 5 assuming it would be an upgrade on my older Word Perfect.  But it would not load on (up-to-date) XP.  Amazon do not give refunds on download software.  Re-downloaded 3 times, rebooted, all give ERROR 1303.  A search of Corel support does not have this error code.  To get Corel technical support under their 30 day warranty you need to register the product.  You can't register the product without a Corel Account.  I created the account but to register the product you need a \\""Product Serial Number\\"", the Product Key supplied by Amazon does not work.  Amazon does not supply the required serial number.  After extensive searching on user forums I found that the serial number may be issued by a company called www.identit-e.com.  They have a primitive website where most of the links don't work or still have the original setup instructions \\""PUT LINK URL HERE\\""  DUH.  They tell you how to create a new URL containing the product manufacturer name but that doesn't work either.    I've sent an email to Amazon explaining the difficulty of getting Corel warranty support.  Amazon have given excellent product support in the past, I hope I can return here with good news.    UPDATE:  Despite a policy of not issuing refunds on software, AMAZON issued a refund.  That is MORE than fair but I still don't have the software and my old (very old) Word Perfect is no longer perfect and keeps crashing.  I'll try ordering direct from Corel."
0,I have used several versions of Printshop. This one is the most user UNfriendly of any of them. Hoping I can figure it out and get comfortable with it but as of right now I am disappointed with it!
1,"I love all Norton products. It really helps keep my computer and my kids computer, virus free. Would definitely recommend."
1,This was a renewal of an existing product. The purchase was easy and the delivery of the required key was immediate.
0,"This is for Office for Mac 2011.<br />I have been limping along with Office 2004 for Mac for quite some time and it has served me well.<br />I finally received something that someone created in EXCEL that I could not open, an XLSM file, so I decided to upgrade.<br />After downloading and installing (the only positive part of this experience, btw!) I found that I was able to open the Excel XLSM file, but accessing one portion of it caused Excel to lock up.<br />This was a simulated EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and the specific sheet in question was nothing really fancy, just lots of check boxes and drop-down boxes.<br />I had to force-quit EXCEL several times attempting different ways of accessing the file.<br />I thought that perhaps the file was corrupted, but additional downloads of the file produced the same results.<br /><br />I gave up and went to my school to see if it was accessible in the computer lab.  I had no trouble opening up the file on an old DELL running Windows XP and Office 2007, in fact, the file had been created with Office 2007.<br />Why can't my brand new version of OFFICE 2011 deal with this Spreadsheet? (I performed all the necessary updates after downloading the software.)<br /><br />I loved the process of buying the software and downloading it.<br />Why can't Office 2011 for Mac deal with an Excel spreadsheet created on Office 2007 for Windows?<br /><br />UPDATE: Sent the file to MS tech support.  They could not open it on Office 2011 for Mac either.<br />Also- the document was locked and password-protected so they could not view how it was actually created, but the support guy did say that the Windows version of Excel offers the ability to create Macros and other things using proprietary Windows tools such as ACTIVE-X (not available at all for Mac in any shape or form) that would render the document unusable for Mac users and he said 99/100 problems with Excel on a Mac are caused by Windows users creating documents using these tools that are not cross-platform compatible."
0,"State tax forms still not loading! Called 1 week ago and was told they were working on a fix, but not loading yet (Feb 2)."
1,"Norton is a reliable, trustworthy product."
1,Downloaded the program with no difficulties. I have been using it for a few years and it still works for me. No problems found so far.
1,Great software having used Norton 360 for two years now!! So confident that this one went on our church computer.
0,"worked fine for a few days, then out of the blue it would only open the window to &#34;create a safe&#34;. i could not open the safe. i contacted the company<br />only to be told there isn't anything thay could do on there end... the option thay suggested was to download a new safe, free of charge and then<br />export what was in the old safe, to the new safe. Wouldn't be much of a safe if that could be done...<br />i have a new safe, but i have nothing in it, i don't trust it yet, everything i had in the old safe,very important doc.etc are gone forever. think about it<br />before you buy it and use it, it just might be TO SAFE."
1,"Very easy to install. Very easy to upgrade. Easy, intuitive interface and functionalities. I can manage day-to-day finances as well as my investment portfolio with minimum set-up effort. The budget and reporting facilities keep important aspects in focus."
1,"Just as simple as turbo tax if not easier, and cost less."
1,Fast and easy download.  Cheaper than the norton website and does the job of protecting my laptop.  What more can you ask for?
0,Their product is superb but their tactics a underhanded.  Got to the end to file my state electronically and they asked if I wanted it the cost of the state filing deducted from my state tax return $$ and the balance deposited in my account.  I checked yes and it proceeded and the stated I would be charged (i believe it was $25 for this service).  I was very disgusted as I was the last step of the process. If I tried to go back I was concerned that I would lose all the data and time I had invested in the process.  But I het the reverse arrow anyway and was able to reject their offer and just pay on line via my credit card with no additional cost for the process.  I had problems with turbo tax at the IRS free tax filing site.  They said it was free and then after filling out all the tax info they charged me for the State Filing w/o stateing this at the beginning of the process.  I saw a lot of other complaints on line about the exact thing.
0,Better than many others I have used and more comprehensive. very good for the price.
1,"I bought this for preparing my taxes for one LLC and one sole-proprietorship. If you have a single member LLC, you don't need the business version to do your taxes. I used to buy TurboTax but have found this to be the best and easiest to use. And I saved more money with this version than I ever did with TurboTax."
1,GREAT!!
1,"Very easy to install! Have been using Malwarebytes free for years and decided to upgrade to &#34;realtime' version, Good price too!"
0,"It's way better than piece of crap Essentials, but still has a way to go before it will be up to snuff. I would never have bought this if I knew how easy it was to update Q2007 to run on the latest OS X release. Found this out after I purchased this. Go to the Quicken website - you can do the upgrade for $15 and keep using your current files. Hope this helps"
1,"A few little quirks...and the ubiquitous prompt to file the State return that is not and has never been required, but overall good experience again. 5th or 6th year of using it.<br /><br />Note: I ONLY use the install (.exe) version. I strongly dislike the TurboTax Online version of the same product. I like to save my file on my local computer and have complete control without the cludgy web interface"
0,"I usually love Quicken, but this version has given me nothing but problems.  After the first 3 updates it crashes as soon as you open it.  I have been waiting on a fix, but have yet to get one.  I went back to my Quicken 2013 until the problem can be fixed.  I have been a Quicken user for a great number of years."
1,"I've used this program for years and it is the most complete, the better of the choices on the market. The deductions list aren't the most thorough, I prefer going onto the IRS website for deductible expenses."
1,"Nice, easy to use product that brings some Mac like functionality to a Windows OS without a lot of overhead"
0,not at all what I'd hoped for.  wasted money.
1,Have used Turbo Tax for years. Online purchase was quick and easy.  Was set up and ready to go in no time.
1,"I just purchased this and can say the switch was quite easy.  With a much more straightforward interface, no annoying plugs for upgrading, no &#34;rebate mania&#34;, I'm sold.  TT (Intuit) had better heed the backlash from their recent decision to force long time users to the more expensive premium version.  Or...not.  This product is cheaper, and does the job it was designed to do...complete and file your taxes without attempting to fleece you."
1,I use this every year and it saves time and money.  The tax laws get more confusing each year and this program gets easier to use each year.
0,too complicated.
1,Installed with and ran with out any problems.
1,"This is one product that makes doing taxes a \\""stroll in the park\\"". Talk about easy and is a breath of fresh air if you have used it in the past, since it pulls all the previous information from prior filings. What use to take me hours, now only takes about an hour. Whew! Now if we can get the IRS to simplify their process we may be able to strengthen the economy again. Their the 'Tick' side of politics!"
0,"That's it! I'm done with TurboTax. I refuse to pay $40 more for what is essentially the same product I used every year. Way to shoot yourselves in the foot, Intuit. I'm going to try my luck with H&R Block."
0,"To complex unusable and no way to return out $180.00<br />Not user friendly, I need an accountant to translate.  I don't have a hard copy if I swap computers /laptop<br />I really feel cheated out of $180.00"
1,"offers just the right balence between performence and security. I have not had any slow downs, but again i have a medium-high performence PC not very many software applications slow it down. Overall a good product been using AVg for 2 years and have not had any virus left on my computer, the scanner always found and cleaned right away."
1,Great website design software. Unlimited capability. Powerful stuff.  Makes designing a site an art form.  Almost more fun than some games.
1,Easy to learn and use. Neat to watch your creations come to life. The bones really help a lot. Can spend hours creating and having a blast.
1,I think that I will come to love it. It's just that it takes so much time to learn how to do the simplest of things and at times I'm overwhelmed with the number of options.
1,"Always have thought this is the best alternative to Photoshop. Not too expensive, and fairly user friendly. Only annoying part is this company doesn't support versions that are old. But that's the same with pretty much everywhere so no complaints! I have been used this product since the first version, and will continue to. Recommend!"
0,"You still have to pay for efile for state, on top of the flat pricing. Very shady, and that information is hidden unless you read EVERYTHING on the product description. It's cheaper to go on turbo tax's website and buy the product there. Then pay for the efile for state, with their promotion right now. Not pleased amazon. Not pleased."
1,"Great program, but had a time registering it."
0,"Not sure if it was just coincidence or not but on two different Sony Vaio laptops I uninstalled Norton 360 and both times my system board and hard drive crashed! Can't explain it but it has happened twice. So simple advice, don't uninstall Norton 360 if you have a Vaio laptop. That being said, Norton 360 when not destroying my system appears to be protecting it just fine."
1,"I don't understand all of the scary reviews of how difficult the software was to download and install.  It took me about 10 minutes or less from start to finish.  Also, I can go back to my Microsoft account to download another copy if my current computer crashes.  This I couldn't do with the Office 2010 Product Key Card.<br />One thing I thought was neat is that Amazon had me re-enter my purchase method information and sent me an email to assure that it was really me.  The only bummer is that the price went up $10 overnight."
0,"This is a pretty small collection of images (1,200 total), and there's not as much variety as I would have hoped.  Lots of clip art images with backpacks, lots of computers and lots of desks, but very few of kids being active in sports other than soccer and skating.  And way too many close-up photographic portraits of kids - just faces; not doing anything, so not really interesting for my purposes.  I was looking for something to use with an elementary school PTA web site for such things as carnival and field day, but there's really nothing that I noticed for either except for one clown image.  The images aren't bad, just not varied enough in my opinion.  I'm not sure how much use I'll actually get out of it."
1,Works well
1,"No confusion on return, went very smoothly."
1,I think this is a plus in my photography work. I am waiting for new product revs to download them to my computer too. This is one good investment i someone likes photo fixing
1,Exactly what i needed to secure 2 home computers at a very reasonable price.  I will buy this again next year
1,"This is the only recovery software that has ever actually worked.  It recovered data from several hard drives that I had done full system restores on.  I was so impressed with this product that I got out a stack of old crashed computes that I never dared to throw away and recovered the data from them as well.  The only draw back is, the product is great if you are recovering your own data, but if your computer ends up in the wrong hands, anyone can gain access to all your data, even data that was deleted from the recycle bin or wiped from the computer during a full system restore.  That is kind of scary."
1,System is generally easy to use.  State is mostly easy but sometimes lacks detailed instructions.  Changes made this year were poorly planned but TurboTax seems to have corrected them.
1,Great piece of software. Been using it for nearly 20 years. It has grown with my business.
1,I have used TurboTax for years and I am pleased with the results. I saved on the purchase price by buying and downloading through Amazon.
1,great free antivirus
1,"Every year I but my norton antivirus because it is a way better price then at my local stores, I never had a problem with it, and when I restore my computer I can always log on to my account on amazon and re download the norton. It keeps my computer safe from viruses, never has failed me ."
0,"Do not buy this version!!  It is a waste of money!!<br />I upgraded to Quicken Premier 2013 since they offered fixes to the budget functionality which they messed up in 2012 and the new Mobile cloud capability.  I should have known after what I went through with Quicken 2012 that it was not going to be good experience going to 2013.  I was hoping that they got their act together after the mess they deliver in 2012.  I have been a user of Quicken for over 15 years and faithfully purchased and upgraded every year to the newest version.  I would have to say I am very disappointed with the quality of software that they have pushed out last year and this year.  In the whole time I have been using Quicken I have never had to uninstall and reinstall the previous version, due to the functionality being unusable, until this release.  Quicken needs to turn around a quick fix for these issues if they want to keep my business.  They should not wait until the push out Quicken 2014 to fix these issues.<br />Once I upgraded to Quicken 2013 I went directly into the budget to see how it was improved.  I will give them credit that it does look a lot better than it did in 2012.  They did listen and take the functionality back to the way it was prior to 2012 with some improvements.  They did add some good features like the roll over capability, but they missed one of the key complaints about the 2012 functionality.  You still cannot enter cents in the budget.  I don't understand how they missed this but this is a key part of doing a budget.  A budget is suppose to be accurate and to the penny.  But in Quicken you have to round to the nearest dollar.  This makes no sense because if all of your incomes round down and all of your expenses round up then you have just over spent without even knowing it.  This really needs to be fixed.  So this was the first strike against Quicken 2013.<br />The next thing I noticed that the totals on the account list were not showing correctly.  They were off or the negative amount of what was in actually in the account.  I did narrow it down to where it was only happening to the accounts that had savings goal transactions.  The more playing around I did the worse it got.  If you checked and unchecked the \\""Show saving goal transactions...\\"" checkbox the total in the account list kept changing.  Each time you check the box a different total appeared.  Whatever they did to the savings goal functionality completely messed the totals up.  This was strike 2.<br />After this I tried to reconcile the accounts thinking that if I did this maybe the accounts total would get back in sync.  This is when I ran into the next big issue that was a show stopper for me.  When I went to reconcile an account that only had interest accrued for that month and no transactions entered, it told me that I had no transactions to reconcile.  In previous versions it would add the interest transaction and bring up the summary window for you to finish reconciling.  So I was unable to reconcile accounts in Quicken 2013.  This was strike three.<br />At this point if figured I might as well look at the mobile functionality.  They already struck out.  The concept is good but after playing with it for a little while I realized that I made a mistake purchasing Quicken 2013 and upgrading.  After I turned on the mobile sync and had it set up on my IPAD I saw that I was getting alerts for categories that I did not spend any money in for the month.  Upon investigation I realized that the sync randomly deleted categories from a lot of my transactions and randomly changed the category on other ones.  At this point I realized that my quicken database was now corrupt and I would have to go back to a back up of my data.  So I uninstalled Quicken 2013 and reinstalled Quicken 2012.  I would not say that 2012 is much better, but I can at least continue to use it as a place to record my transaction.  Ever since I upgraded to 2012 I have not been able to maintain a budget.  Which sucks!!  I pay all this money for software that is suppose to help me manage my finances and it only makes me have to do more manual work outside of Quicken.  I really hope that Quicken refunds my money because I did not pay to be one of their testers."
0,this system seems easy enough to install  but it did not upload anything
1,Great
1,"Very easy to use.  transfers info from previous year, so it is very simple and easy to use.  I do not understand why they charge for state returns.<br />(At least one state should be electronically filed for free.)  I would have had to pay $25  (over half of my refund) to have my state tax return filed electronically.  The state does not charge, so I assume Turbo Tax is making the profit.  I paid $.70 postage and paper filed."
1,"I bought this program with some trepidation as previous tax software which I have used just were not fully applicable to our tax situation.  My husband is a pastor, and we can attest that this is the first software we have seen which is set up for the various issues clergy face.<br /><br />We found also that TurboTax is quite intuitive, helping us maximize our deductions, and saved us several hundred dollars over the tax preparation company we used last year."
1,Legal !!!
1,This is the third time I have used Norton and I love it. Not too invasive and protects very well.
0,"Installed fast, scans fast, but does not give any report for what is scanned. I am very sure i have spyware but the program doesn't give any scan results so idk if anything has been found. I hope its working... but for $20 I guess its worth the attempt."
1,Most viruses load while booting up and cannot be deleted while running. Avast has a boot time scan which detects the viruses before they can start. I repair computers and recommend Avast even if they only use the free version.
1,"I have been using Quicken for several years now and just recently upgraded from Quicken 2013 to Quicken 2015. This is such an easy program to maneuver around in and I've had no trouble adjusting to the upgrade. For the first time I've actually added my Credit Cards to track purchases and Quicken makes it so easy by downloading my transactions for me. Really this program is so simple and when everything is entered will give you a very clear picture of your financial status, your spending habits and where you may need to cut back on. It will also keep track of your portfolio. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to keep a budget or just wants to keep up with their financial situation. It also makes end of the year tax time much easier because you can print reports of everything you will need for your taxes."
1,It worked as claimed and I saved some money in the process. Hope that it will work for you as well.
1,Great dealing no problems with downloading very easy to use norton has very good quality going to buy every year
1,Awesome price. I needed a to renew my CA software but I decided to go back to Norton. I really wasn't happy with how CA worked with my pc. Glad to be back with Norton simple as that. Quick and easy download.
1,"I have been using Norton 360 for years and this is the best thing that happened. I used to wait for sales in stores.Then buy the cd and installed on 3 computers, then mailed the rebate back for the coupon, just a waste of days. I love this new download version.Price is affordable. I downloaded it on one pc and from the same pc renewed for the other two with Norton Management. How easy, at the most took me couple of hours and I am done for a year.Love it, thanks! Great product and I highly recommend it."
0,Prefer Turbo Tax but couldn't pass up price.
0,"i purchased this and it cannot be downloaded and cannot cancel, all i know is i need to wait up to 4 hours"
1,worked fine
1,Easy download and contained in my digital library for future use without having to keep the CD's.  Easy to use program that I have used for years.
1,"I love the product, just wish it would suggest a budget based on spending habits....maybe it already does this and I just haven't found it yet. Also, I wish this was compatible with H and R Block online taxes. Otherwise, great product and really opened my eyes up to where my money was going!"
0,"I found this to be a poor third rate effort to offer a Quicken product for Mac.  No memorized transactions list.  Half baked reconciliation process which requires you to enter interest earned as a transaction, not part of reconciliation.  If someone would offer a product even as good as Quicken for PC was 10 years ago for Mac, it would be a best seller."
1,Photoshop Elements is a great alternative to buying the full Photoshop for people who play around with the program. I use it for some advanced features as well. I love that I don't have to pay monthly for the program when this has a lot of features as well. Try this trial before paying for a subscription service! You may be surprised what Elements can do!
0,"2011 was much better.  2014 is slower.  2014 constantly loses where I put the cursor, or seems to, I see it on the screen but I can't use my arrow keys till I click AGAIN.  So I'm going to say 2014 is not only slower, but &#34;clunky&#34;.  Oh, and what's the 1 thing software like this should do unfailingly?  Math.  Basic addition and subtraction.  It's not hard.  Previous versions had no issue with it (or at lease 2011 and before).  2014 has constant trouble with math.  Solution is easy, close the program and immediately open it again, to find all your totals corrected.  Just hope we all don't make an important decision thinking we have more in an account then we actually do...<br /><br />Hard part is, there's literally no competitor left on the market.  Yes, similar software exists, but every single one of those (primarily online) solutions fills a different need then this.  And they force you to upgrade every 3 years.  No clue what I'll do in 2017..."
1,It works
1,"I upgraded from Quicken 2007 with some trepidation after reading the online reviews that emphasize the new program's non-parity with the Windows version. Most of the critiques focus on missing features relevant to folks that are active day traders and folks that run businesses at home, etc. For me, I just wanted to consolidate my cash accounts at a local Credit Union and a brokerage account at Fidelity that holds a cash account, mutual funds, retirement accounts and stocks, along with several credit cards. My primary goal is to keep track of things in one place and mostly to simplify tax-related reporting each year. Rather than import my old data from Quicken 2007, I decided to start fresh and set up everything with data starting on 1/1/2015.<br /><br />The setup was seamless and I have everything working nicely. The free iOS companion app is nice but limited (no viewing of brokerage account, for example). For _my_ needs, Quicken 2015 for Mac is working well.<br /><br />Feature suggestion: The ability to link images to transactions is nice, but it requires one to save an image as a file and only then import it through a file search process - cumbersome. Both of my cash accounts (my credit union and Fidelity) post images of canceled checks online; the current workflow requires one to do a 'save as' of each online image to the local drive and then navigate to the image from within Quicken. It would be great to simply drag and drop the online image onto a specific transaction so that the image(s) of the canceled checks are archived locally."
1,yes H&R Block DID everything I wanted.<br />I would rate it at five.
0,"I have a screaming fast computer. Raid 10 drives, I7 processor, Lots of fast memory. The only thing that runs slow on this computer is Quicken. And I run a lot of different software programs on this computer. Sure can't recommend this. I wish there was an alternative, but since there is no Microsoft Money, these jerks have an undeserved monopoly."
1,I enjoyed using Turbo Tax. It was very user friendly. It asks all the important questions. I give
1,I have been using this product for a few years and don't have the problems I had in the past.I gave it 4 stars because there is always a need for improvement to stay ahead of the problem makers
0,"I needed to do a tax return for a family trust.  So I needed form 1041 and associated forms.  Because I had used Turbo Tax for many years, I chose to buy their version that included form 1041.  I expected the Business version to provide all the hand-holding explanations that the Deluxe Turbo Tax provides for personal tax returns.  I was surprised at how bare-bones the Business version was!  I spent more time reading the IRS instructions than I expect to.  Considering the price I paid for the Business version, it was not much help."
1,Still the best; I've been using TurboTax for years and can't recommend it enough. Easy to use and thorough in every respect.
0,"We just bought a brand new iMac and Photoshop was one of the first apps that we installed on it.  It repeatedly crashed (at least 5 times on the first day) and was not stable enough to be used.  I eventually resorted to using iPhoto.  This was a royal waste of money (note: we had Photoshop 11 on our old PC - we encountered issues there as well, but not to the extent of the Mac version)."
1,It has helped me to remove some unwanted viruses and malware that have at times infected my computer. I like it.
1,"As a 15 year user of Turbo Tax Basic, I came to Amazon for my yearly TT download.  However, I immediately noticed TT had a &#34;1-star&#34; rating this year, whereas it was always rated 5 stars in the past.  In reading the TT reviews, I realized TT was basically now selling last year's free (1040EZ and 1040A) software under the &#34;Basic&#34; name.  Anyone, like me, who bought the &#34;Basic&#34; version for the schedules (A, B, C, etc.) and forms was getting pushed to the Premier version selling for close to $50.  Just another corporate money grab. Yes, I read that TT tried to recant their bad decision by providing the schedules and forms...but guess what TT....too late.<br /><br />I was initially apprehensive about having to learn a new (H&R Block) tax software program, but I found the H&R software easier to use than TT.<br />It is extremely easy to use, very accurate, and has all the schedules and forms I need.<br />Now that my taxes are complete, I have decided to stick with this H&R Block software until they (hopefully never) pull a TT scam.<br /><br />In closing, if you are like me (and others) whom have used Turbo Tax Basic (the real one), I can assure you will not be disappointed in changing to H&R Block Tax software.<br />Thank you."
1,"Been using PSP Xseries since PSP 2 and it works great for me with only minor issues with regard to how it does what it does.  Of course, all the hype about Adobe photoshop got me interested in seeking an even better alternative so I did their trial download. Photoshop costs a lot more, and it is certainly more powerful, but for what I do (restore old photos, create collages, prepare photos to use as icons, etc., it meets my needs wonderfully. My only critique would be that the &#34;soften&#34; function sometimes leaves telltale lines which then require further correction. For all that it does for the price tho, that's a very minor issue. You can do quick photo adjustments or extensive adjustments, or both. I've attached a couple of photos I took at Disney world. You can see how the program helps you make significant changes in order to make the pic show as what you want it to."
0,"I've just taken the 30 day trial for MSOffice.  I have not used all areas.  That's why I'm only reviewing Word, for now.<br /><br />The install went okays but Word keeps freezing on me, literally, every 3rd time that I use it. The old Office never did that.  Actually, that's what inspired this review.  Word froze on me, again.  I'd just saved corrections to my research paper. Lost functionality so I had to close the window via task manager.  Reopened it...AND my paper wasn't saved with any of my additions.<br />This is not the end of the world but, damn it, this is a 20-page paper!  I've nursed a headache and two nosebleeds writing it. I'm not exactly angered, though, because I didn't buy it (thank God).  In fact, that I didn't purchase is the only thing preventing a massive conniption fit the likes of which this library has never seen.  I'm just irritated.  So, of course, this is an opportune time to take it out on the internet. LOL<br /><br />Additionally, this version of Word (at least) doesn't really add anything new.  They've just switched how you go about doing things about.  Visually, it's a step-down from other versions. In my opinion. Personalizing for the 2010 was just better.<br />I actually like Windows 8 but this OFFICE?  I don't know why it's more expensive.<br />I plan to install MSOffice 2010 and be done with.<br /><br />I want to mention that I bought my computer direct from the factory a month ago.<br />It's not MY computer."
1,"Quickbooks Online is a fast, foolproof way for me to invoice clients, keep tabs on my expenses, and make tax time much easier."
0,"The disk that came with it (for extra artwork) could not be used as it said it is not compatible.  This program is basic, which is what I was looking for, all I needed was a simple program.  I would have rated it higher, except the art work isn't the best for choices and without the extra clip art on the disk, the price wasn't really all that great for what you get."
0,Had great reviews so I thought it was a better alternative than paying $80 for the other brands but I should have. Avast still allowed my computer to get viruses. Now I can't even connect to the internet or save documents. Horrible product.
0,"Norton pretty much gave up on software for Mac computers many years ago.<br />Intego has been in the business of protecting Macs much longer now and has upgraded its software with each version.<br />If you have Mountain Lion OSX 10.8 installed, you should consider it."
1,"avast! Free Antivirus 2014 is very good.  I've used it for approximately 6 years, and I've never had a problem with it, and it has caught viruses and dealt with them.  I recommend it very highly to anyone who wants to have their computer kept safe.  I also use a separate Anti-Spyware program, and it works together with avast! Antivirus."
1,"I love Norton, not only for the virus protection, but all the add-ons that help me keep my information and passwords safe."
1,Best PDF converter I have ever seen.  Will convert even if the quality is poor.  Well worth the cost
1,"For free software, this seems to work really well. I have used it on several different computers over the years."
0,Works good but too expensive.  I plan to look for a cheaper program next year.
0,Install it to get the bitlocker for encryption. Other than that we don't need it for other purposes. So it is kind of expensive.
0,"NO OFFLINE PRINTING!  TurboTax is great if you do not mind uploading YOUR final return to THEIR servers before you can print.  Yes, that is right.  BEFORE YOU CAN PRINT.  I have been a TurboTax Software user for 10 or more years.  I will never buy their product again.  Why does TurboTax require me to connect to the internet through their servers to print my return you might ask?  I would love to know the reason for that too.  My return is between me and the IRS, not TurboTax.  We have been victims of identity theft in the past.  So, excuse me if i am just a little apprehensive about sharing information with TurboTax SERVERS just to print my return.  I am going to the post office and getting the paperwork to file my return the old fashioned way.  Why?  Because I cannot export my return to print it NOR can I print my return to MAIL it to the IRS.  If you don't like to put your social security number on the internet with a company that has NO BUSINESS asking for that information, save your money.  Use another product.  As for me, GOOD BYE TurboTax!"
1,"Adds that degree of security heavier users need. I relied on disk/partition imaging, which has often saved me, but too often I haven't taken a new image recently enough. That's where Rollback RX fills in the gaps, and helps deal with issues that unexpectedly arise, offering a quick way to get back to a functional bootable PC with the least distraction. Microsoft's System Restore only covers the major areas, and even then it's all to easy to find you've no restore points for one reason or another. And with Windows 8, Microsoft have made Safe Mode virtually inaccessible in some circumstances without having made changes to the default configuration.    That's why you need Rollback RX."
0,Unnecessary programs were installed.
1,"I had some huge files on my SD card like 60 GB AVCHD files taken on my camcorder with video and just couldn't fit the video on a DVD. Duh ... Finally I got smart and googled my problem. I chose Movavi to compress the files and it was so easy, intuitive, I didn't have to rack by brain to do it . A breeze...I got the video suite but the converter showed up almost immediately when I opened the program ,not sure why but I'm glad it did. Didn't check out the editing features yet though. But just thrilled with the converter. It takes a little time but hey for $59 I'm very happy!"
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for several years now, and I love the fact that I can order and download it through Amazon so much cheaper than I can anywhere else.  This is good value for the price.  Also, this program has helped us stay on top of our taxes and finances for quite a while.  The step-by-step approach, along with the extra helps one can get to clarify, are great."
1,"I bought this to edit my HDR photos.  I purchased a $30 Photomatix plugin for Lightroom and now have the perfect HDR editing tool.  This makes the perfect HDR photos in just minutes.  With the help of a youtube video I was up and running in no time at all.  Lightroom comes with many presets for photo editing and you can find thousands more free presets online that allow you to do amazing things with your photos and it only takes seconds to do this.  I now love to shoot photos on a cloudy day because of the dramatic effects you can get using Lightroom.  Lightroom allows you to do many things that you used to require Photoshop to edit and it makes it so easy to accomplish what used to be a cumbersome task in Photoshop.<br /><br />Easy to learn, easy to use, and excellent results what more do you need out of a photo editing software."
1,"No doubt about it. Dragon Premium 13 is the best dragon yet. Now, if we could get Microsoft onboard to build operating systems compatable with the world's software, I could use Dragon 13 on my other computers."
1,I've paid for quite a few that either didn't catch issues or else weighed my machine down.  This program is free and awesome!  There is no excuse for anyone not to run an antivirus now.
1,"I love this product & since I could download shipping wasn't an issue.  I already posted a review right after I downloaded it but I'll say it again that to me, this is the best product of its kind.  I'm pretty sick right now so that's all I can say but honestly, I don't know if I could express my appreciation for this product anymore than I've already have. It's just not possible because of how great it is.<br /><br />Thanks again!"

0,"They say it's free to e-file, but it's not. They say the charges are for something else.... whatever, if I print it out and mail it in it's free but if I e-file it's $50 times 2 since I filed for my fiancee, they can say it's for whatever or whatever but I still have to pay one way and don't have to pay the other... that's not my definition of free. But it beats going to H&R Block and getting bent over the the desk."

1,I bought this version because I upgraded my PC to Windows 7. The transition is smooth and the new version has some new and useful features. I am quite happy with the purchase.
1,"I have used Norton for quite a few years and as of this date, have not had any issues with virus, so I guess the software is doing it's job. No 5 star because it does slow down the computer more then necessary, I think."
1,Haven't gotten virus yet.  So I guess it is a good thing.  I like how its easy to use and you can create settings to scan based on your preference.
0,It's very different from the old one I'm use to. Not as easy to use. I will learn it the more I use it tho.
1,Switched this year from TurboTax because the cost Intuit decided to implement. Seems to work just as well and imported all my info from last year.
1,better than expected...it did the audit of the tax return as well.
1,Best place to get this software every year is Amazon. As for the software I have a tried a lot of other programs and this one is my favorite. However I do find it a bit complicated at times.
0,"I bought this software as a first time video editor, so I can't compare this product to other. In general the software does the job. It allows one to edit video, add and edit music, and export the final product. However, the software is not very user friendly and the available manual didn't help much. I spent a lot of time on user feedback sites in order to understand how to add / utilize several features. Also, the sound edit feature is limited (example, when trying to clean up background noise). From other user feedback, it appears that it's much better to edit the video's sound with another software."
1,"Very awesome program. Instead of &#34;backing up&#34; you actually copy the stuff that hasn't been copied already. With back up, you get the full path of the original files. This works wonders."
1,"Due to the arthritis in my hands, I find it difficult to sit for more than a few minutes at a time and type reviews of books I've read emails I wish to send in commentaries on blogs. Since I also have decided to return to college and this requires writing a great number of papers, I have selected Dragon NaturallySpeaking with the hopes of creating my papers in a far more easier and enjoyable manner.<br /><br />This software did not take me very long to understand or use, and it has made it far easier for me to communicate with others."
1,"Great site, easy to use."
1,I thought I had to just renew my Norton Antivirus at the same HIGH price on my computer!! It was like $40-$50!!! I did NOT want to pay that price!!  Was going to try Ad Aware but then I would lose all my passwords that were saved under my Norton Account. Somehow I was lead to Amazon and saw I could get the same thing for $12!!!  I was amazed n delighted!!  It took me step by step! Everything was quick and easy and I can always find my info cuz Amazon stores it under my soft wear purchases!!  Yay for AMAZON!!!  I'm a happy camper!
1,Did what it was supposed to do and was way cheaper than H&R Block and  it had the same thing they had when i checked it against them.
1,Did the job
1,Seems to be working great! Norton is the only security that I have ever used that works!
0,"Norton is great - if it works correctly.  I bought this product from Amazon but the downloaded installation had a glitch that lost ALL my password and login information.  Years of research associated with logins will now be lost because I counted on the vault to hold not only my sign-in info, but also the websites I needed.  It was easier to use the vault for special websites with log-in info than to use bookmark.  I spent 3 hours on tech support to get the software loaded because of the glitch - and I'm a computer tech!  Tech support was superb.  I highly recommend Norton - but purchased from a trusted source.  You get what you pay for."
1,Best Ever
1,"The download worked as expected. The software is easy to use, navigate, and understand. I expect to purchase this product again next year."
1,"this software is user friendly and easy to understand. Finally a software company is treating its customer with some respect asking us if we want to make changes verse making changes and forcing us to figure them out, and it works too."
1,I would recommend it to everyone.
0,"Crashed my entire system (Mac OS 10.9.5) ... not only do I have to start over on my return because the software apparently doesn't do any sort of saving in progress, but my entire system became unresponsive after I finished entering all my federal info.  So 45 minutes later, back to square one.  I've been using TT for years (and, unlike others, the Deluxe still suits my needs) but this is a joke.  I seem to recall this happened last year too.  Save your money and buy something that works!"
0,"Looks to be a repeat of Quicken 2014 H&B in terms of lack robustness and reliability.  I installed it yesterday and had a significant software update today as well as one hard crash and three lock-ups in less than three hours of total usage.  It doesn't appear I've lost any data, but this is not building confidence.  Q2014 H&B had similar issues and took almost six months and numerous updates to stabilize.  What is going on at Intuit???  Don't they have proper regression testing, unit testing, alpha/beta trials, Q/A, etc.  This is NOT how to properly develop/field mission critical software.  Get it together folks...if a solid competitor appears and offers me a deal I'm gone as a customer.  And I've been using your software for over fifteen years.  This is not acceptable."
1,Excellent product for ease of functioning & learning.
1,It was quick and easy to load and use.
0,"This is ripe for a class action, as Amazon is not doing anything about it, but keeps selling the product. Basically, if you are a Mac user, the product will not work. Once downloaded, the product won't open."
1,"Amazing.prompt support.  They really care. Works great with Pinterest.  Wish I found years Over the years I have bought multiple recipe Organizers. Well I finally have the only one I will ever need. You can scan recipes in there, you can just go to a website and add the recipe w/o typing the whole thing. It has a feature that if you have a recipe saved in a type written format - you don't have to type the whole thing in - Amazing.  This software has so many features it is unbelievable. Also they genuinely care about customer service.  I actually had e-mailed them a couple of times with questions and it amazes me how quickly they respond. Same day or next. There are video's as well you can watch on using the software.  Out of all the software I own and have used their customer service support is the BEST I have ever had. I have a folder full of printed recipes that I am going to scan and import into cook'n. This is so worth it. Also, as they keep adding features your software is automatically updated. Phenomenal!!!"
1,Like it.
0,"The retail version of the shrink-wrapped physical TurboTax package in the store is the same price as the retail download version (not counting discounts from resellers like Amazon.)  This is a shame for a company touting to be environmentally friendly and highlighting it as a selling point for their \\""download\\"" product.  After all, a digital download is significantly cheaper to Intuit:    -- there's no CD to press  -- no packaging (which is all PLASTIC with Intuit)  -- no fuel to deliver it to stores  -- no labor costs involved with producing and delivering physical product  -- and no leftover manufacturing waste to dispose of.      Yet Intuit still charges you full price for the download.  So in essence they say, \\""be environmentally responsible -- and pay us more than a premium to do so.  You'll feel better stuffing our pockets with the cash we saved by not producing and distributing a physical product, all under the guise of being environmentally responsible.\\""    Shame on Intuit.  The price should be less than half of the retail version -- not the same.  I know what I'm talking about -- I work in the Software Industry.  Besides the costs indicated above, they also avoid these costs to their bottom-line:    -- maintaining and managing physical inventory (and required warehouse facilities)  -- accepting unsold inventory returns  -- disposing of unpurchased inventory in landfills (who wants Turbo Tax 2009 in 2011?)  -- loss of physical inventory due to theft  -- and other benefits not on the top of my mind; I'm sure you could add a few.    AND HERE's THE KICKER:  This exact same software when purchased via CD comes with both Windows and MACINTOSH versions.  Not so with this download -- It's PC only.  This is ironic; Apple makes the most environmentally friendly PCs in the world -- and Intuit makes a BIG point about downloading software as being great for the environment -- and then forces customers to purchase a CD with PLASTIC packaging to run it on a Macintosh.  Seethe irony?    Go ahead: purchase the download.  It is better for the environment -- AND simultaneously lines the pockets of Intuit for taking advantage of YOU for being a responsible human being.  Shame on Intuit!"
1,"Great product from Symantec, as always.  I have used this for years and it never disappoints. I recommend it highly."
0,"I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of these reviews are fake. There is absolutely no way that people are so cheery about this overpriced, buggy software.<br /><br />This version of Quickbooks (even after all the Intuit updates) has a number of incredibly frustrating bugs, the worst being Bank Feed's overly aggressive autofill which makes using it an absolute nightmare. I spoke with a Intuit tech support rep and he acknowledged that the tech team was aware of it but given that they were already working on QB 2015 I should just hope that it was fixed in next version. (!!!)<br /><br />In the meantime, he suggested only using the left shift on my keyboard as the right shift (and arrow keys) seems to trigger the autofill.<br /><br />Seriously? In a $400 piece of software? This is the best solution you can come up with?"

1,I didn't find the functionality reduced for may tax bracket. I trust Turbo Tax.
0,"It's ok for a big box product, typical memory consumptions, etc.  I know there are smaller more efficient products out there but I needed something that would be goof proof for my extended family to use - they never pay attention to updates so we needed to automate that process"
0,"I don't like the 2014 version of quicken because it opens an update page every time I sign on and before I have the Quicken 2014 version up. Also it mixes transactions on the download and changes to name to a different transaction that the original one on the banks side. ex: transaction is xyz from the back and qrs shows up on download. Also, with different banks you just can't do an automatic down load."

1,"This is a great deal, especially considering the protection you get.  I also like the fact that they are US based."
1,I like it all the way.  It is reasonably priced and I like it.  Keep up the good work always.  enough??????????????????????????
1,I have been using this product for years.  This new 2015 product now includes both Internet Security and Norton 360 instead of separate programs prior to this version.  They are now both incorporated into this one product.  Norton has always been one of top rated for Internet Security programs.
0,Been using Nortons since the days of the 386.  The low rating is because you can't download it from the amazon website.  Easiest why I have found is to download the free trial from Nortons and then activate that.<br />On the other hand you can download Norton utilities from amazons site.
1,QuickBooks Online Plus is fantastic. In the past 6 months I've used it it has saved me countless hours and increased my ability to do the things I need to do to keep my business running and making more money than ever!
1,"I have been using avast for years,  It works well and i rarely have problems. Thanks Avast<br /><br />I can recommend avast without reservation."
1,This is such an easy program to use for video editing.  I was able to take our old home moves and convert them to DVD format.  I added titles and background music.  The special effects are so simple to use and they really make a great difference in the final production.  It's well worth the money.
1,"First off, CorelCAD is not \\""a new kid on the block\\"".<br />The CAD engine behind it is Graebert's Ares, as in Ares Commander. (Graebert as in PowerCAD, FelixCAD and a mobile CAD on Win CE.)<br />The same engine is in Dassault Systemes' Draftsight.<br />My interest arose because I no longer have the need or budget for keeping up with AutoCAD, or even AutoCAD LT.<br />From time to time I need to crunch files with something like a million vectors and AMG coordinates, and have found that the difference in performance between native 64 bit and 32bit software running on a 64 bit system is substantial.<br />The basic version of Draftsight is available as 64 bit and is still free, but if you need to go to the next step, the upgrade from Draftsight Basic to Premium is a big leap: minimum is 5 licences and annual subscription, eg about $A2000 p.a.<br />The solution that suits my needs is CorelCAD 2013, available as 32 and 64 bit.<br />Some useful add-ins are included, more possibly available if/when they start getting written. This might happen, as the Ares user base is large enough.<br />CorelCAD will load LISP routines. For me, some worked, some didn't. Not necessarily the fault of CorelCAD or the Ares engine, but nothing actually crashed the program. A few old favourites from way back worked fine, others terminated with a \\""null\\"" response.<br />If you need LISP routines and have the skills to modify them (which I don't) then you should be able to find a work-around.<br />If you are experienced with AutoCAD, then you will find that CorelCAD's display is very similar to AutoCAD 2000 - 2008, and you can use AutoCAD commands out of the box. 95% will work the same. The default Alias function picks up the rest, and can be modified.<br />There is a 138 page pdf file, \\""ARES(tm) for AutoCAD Users\\"", available at modest cost on Graebert's website:<br />https://secure.graebert.com/"

I immediately had error messages when trying to download the product. When I called customer service they basically said I had a cheap laptop and it would require software protection which they could provide at $249 for a 2 year service. Now I do want to let you know that this all took 1-1/2 hours to do.  And my laptop is brand new and not cheap! The customer support person said that I would never be able to download this product without this \\""patch\\"" service. That's BS! I asked for a refund. He had me call another person to get this done. I am so disappointed."
1,I've been using it for several years now and I really appreciate how it walks me through the painful process of both federal and state taxes. It's user friendly and explains questions as you go. It's much cheaper than any tax service and keeps me up on what I might need differently each year.
0,"I've been using it two days now and it's not all that easy to use. It's not really intuitive and so far I have found their help to be lacking.  I cannot recommend this software, I wish I had bought a different program.<br /><br />If you select \\""standard\\"" installation they automatically install a program called Simplicheck on your system. Even if you select \\""custom\\"" install they still try to install it.<br /><br />They force you to give a name upon registration.<br /><br />I paid for this software, that's all they need to know, and they have no right in install software on my computer behind my back - very deceitful."

I really like that so that I can be aware of that site in the future plus it makes me feel safe. Avast also reminds me when I need to update any of my software which is very helpful. It has several types of virus scans including preboot scans which will help you to remove any unwanted programs or malware which is awesome. It has many many more features too numerous to name just suffice it to say that it is excellent. I have tried others such as Norton, AVG etc. and have always had problems with them. I have had nothing but satisfaction with Avast and would recommend it to my friends and family as well as any user out there! I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you Avast."
1,Did what it was supposed to do
0,"The software is a solid product but customer support and documentation is minimal.  If you like to know how things work, need help working out technical issues then this product is on thin ice. As long as things go well with no problems - it has all of the basic functionality and is easy to use.  I would think a product of this magnitude would have better support or at least a user manual."
0,"One star is generous.  I've been purchasing the same Turbo Tax Deluxe software for years.<br /><br />I purchased the same thing this year.<br /><br />When I was trying to enter my K-1 income, a tab popped up advising me that I needed to pay an additional $30 to upgrade the software since &#34;Deluxe&#34; no longer includes business income.<br /><br />There was no warning from Turbo Tax that they were going to extract more dollars for the same software.  I feel deceived and cheated.  I am done with Turbo Tax.  I am flipping the bird in your direction, Turbo Tax."
0,"Should be renamed &#34;Quirken&#34;.<br />But what else does as much.<br />(I really miss Microsoft Money and its support and updates! But, alas....!)"
0,"I bought this to design the inside of my new house. It's pretty limited. You can't add things like crown molding if you didn't select that style room. You can't put a backsplash wherever, If you try to add it to a wall it will tile the whole wall. You can't render files to 3d realistic photos. I've downloaded some of the additional content but it's still not enough. If you want to be able to professionally design a home you have to spend the $2900 to buy the better program. This will come with basic items and some basic designer items but not what I needed or was expecting. Can't even find a decent style of granite."
0,"Don't waste your money.  Quicken for max ox lion is a bust.  First off, converting to OX Lion was a big mistake.  Then, I find Quicken didn't convert their product to OX Lion.  So now I have lost all financial records for the past 5 years...Thanks Mac OX Lion and thanks Quicken."
1,gets the job done
1,"I never imagined that I could find something that was close to Microsoft Word, Excel etc. but Apache is right up there with them. It is easy to follow and somewhat easier than the office programs via Microsoft."
1,Works for me
0,"I got a virus, got rid of the virus but it killed all my Excel files, plus my PDF files - another story. File extension was O.K. xls and xlsx but corrupted data. Had over 1,00 files. This software DID NOT repair 1 File. Thank God I had back-ups for most of the files!"
1,I'm sold on turbo tax.
1,Great product. Been using it for 7 years....Would recommend it to whoever is doing takes at home. I love it
1,If you want to share you must log into your Amazon account on the computer you want to download it on.
1,Solid product that I trust.  Step by step guide makes easy work of our very complicated tax laws.  Recommend to all.
1,So far I like everything about this product!  It's everything the ad says it is.
0,"I can offer many examples of companies that gave away their business because of stupid decisions. Japanese car companies, Walmart, and Southwest Airlines are textbook examples of businesses that benefited from blunders. I am sure H&R Block cannot believe their good luck. Why would anyone buy this product next year even if Intuit recognizes the mistake and fixes it? Network television is probably next, but Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Walmart, and Apple are all headed in that direction."
1,"The first project I bought this for was scanning old genealogical records to create a PDF book.  I needed to crop, rotate, and in some cases, reverse white-on-black scans to black-on-white.  Finally, I needed to combine all of these pages into a single PDF file., and make it &#34;searchable&#34;; so I could find specific text within the scanned pages.  It took some effort, but in the end, I was able to accomplish all of these things with the software.<br /><br />The only real issue I found was with the &#34;Make PDF Searchable&#34; feature, which OCRs the text so you can find words within the document.  The feature itself worked fine, except in some cases where I had rotated a page and cropped it, the &#34;Make Searchable&#34; function would move the crop rectangle so that part of the page was no longer visible.  I was able to work around this by using the &#34;Make Searchable&#34; function BEFORE cropping.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with its ease of use, I didn't have to look up much in the manual.  This is great software for a price far less than Adobe Acrobat Standard."
1,"Just install the Norton 360 protection then forget about it. There is no need to review the attacks on your computer before anything is done to defend your files the Norton 360 takes care of these problems all on its own unless you suggest that it contact you prior to protecting your computer. I downloaded mine in order to get the most recent version (a disc version could be weeks or even months old before it gets to you, the end user.)<br />  I have been very happy, my computer runs faster, It got rid of my defunct registry keys and everything else that slowed me down, I'm extremely happy with the results!"
0,"I still don't get why the reconcile feature insists on adding a \\""reconcile amount,\\"" when none is needed. This never happened when I used Quicken with a PC."
1,"Simple, fast and a good value."
1,"Not sure why people have been having issues, but this digital download installed and worked flawlessly on my iMac (20-inch Early 2008) running Snow Leopard (10.6.8) in 32 bit mode.  The processor is an Intel Core Duo and I have 4 GB of RAM installed.    When I go to the black Apple at the top-right side of the screen, click on it, select \\""About This Mac\\"", click the \\""More Info\\"" button, Apple's System Profiler application launches.  On the left-side of the System Profiler window, I select \\""Software\\"".  The \\""64-bit Kernel and Extensions\\"" line on the right of the window reads \\""No\\"", so I know I'm in 32 bit mode.    I'm very satisfied with this year's TurboTax Deluxe for Mac and would not hesitate recommending it to others.    If you want to be really safe, you may want to go to Apple's knowledge-base to see if your computer is CAPABLE of booting in 64 bit mode.  You can find the article on Apple's website at the following URL:[...] . Also, if you test yourself to see if your Mac running Snow Leopard will boot in 64 bit mode, just restart the computer and hold down the \\""6\\"" and \\""4\\"" buttons until you get to your Finder/desktop.  If you follow the steps from my second paragraph above, the \\""64-bit Kernel and Extensions\\"" line on the right of the window will read \\""Yes\\"", if you are booted I'm in 64 bit mode.  If the Mac you own DOES NOT use the 64-bit kernel by default in Mac OS X v10.6, then the next time you restart your Mac, it will boot back up in 32 bit mode.  If your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with the 32-bit kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup.    Again, I downloaded, installed and used this copy of TurboTax Deluxe in 32 bit on my iMac (20-inch Early 2008) Core 2 Duo without any problems at all.    Hope this helps some confused shoppers!"
1,when microcrap doesn't update I check here
1,Very simple to use.  I recommend turbo tax to the average tax payer who dosn't want to spend $400 at H&R block.  I used turbo tax for the past 10 years.  The only difference was this year I purchased the deluxe turbo tax in which I thought there wasn't a big difference from the basic.
1,"This upgrade was very easy to do, and it works very well. I did it all without having too much knowledge about this OS."
1,"Used heavily in vet school for editing and converting professors powerpoint and pdf presentations, some of which were disasters, huge in size, way to spread out, etc. Definitely recommended, I became a class hero for fixing and condensing notes and presentations"
0,Can't say would not download return to inteuit.... Sent the e-mail for return but have not gotten any response....
0,"Just adequate, but obviously very low on Intuit's priority list. I won't go over what others have reviewed. For me, two immediate problems:<br />1. Quicken shows the wrong projected balance on my credit card account, and I can't figure out why, nor is there any help.<br />2. No grid lines in the account window to separate one transaction from the next visually. Just a blank white field. Why drop the alternating green/white fields from before??<br />Really sad."
1,Superb editing software.
1,"I had previously work with Sage and Peach Tree however Quickbooks makes accounting so much easier, and uncomplicated. This is a software that would cover basic needs as it would also do bigger companies needs. Our small business gets well managed and perfectly accounted with QuickBooks Online. I highly recommended."
1,Easy to use!
1,"After my big disappointment with Quicken  Essentials 2 years ago, I have to say that  Quicken 2015 really delivers on the Intuit promise for quality products. Having the ability to properly track investment portfolios and to synchronize with mobile devices are great features. I still hope for a yearly budget in a future update, some of my planned expenses are not monthly."
0,"Uh, oh . . . so glad I read the reviews for Turbo Tax 2014 BEFORE ordering.  I've been using this software since 1995 and search each Dec-Jan for the best price.  The changes to Deluxe this year are putting me on hold, waiting to see if Intuit responds and adds back Schedule D function to the software."
1,I have used several other antivirus programs including the &#34;big&#34; names.  I have found Avast gives great performance in protection.  I especially appreciate its seamless use ... it doesn't hog resources or create software conflicts.  I highly recommend Avast!
1,I tried many other programs for converting videos but I have never found one that can do what Movavi does or do it so quickly. On my newer Intel Core I7 system it is able to convert 8 videos at a time using the 8 cores of the cpu. It is so much quicker than the programs that don't support the multiple cores and hyperthreading of newer cpus. I convert over 200 videos a week for my music video use so it cuts my converting time by hours each week. The other great feature is being able to drag and drop a group of folders and it will convert all the videos in the folder leaving the new files in the original folders. The only thing I wish it would do is to be able to have a watch folder that will leave the original and converted files in the original folder just like when I drag and drop a folder. Currently you have to specify a folder for all the converted videos to output to. But that is only for the watch folder.
1,"Nice upgrade, still a little pricey, but cheapest here on Amazon."
1,My taxes have become more complicated since I started investing in the stock market.  This was my second year to use Turbo Tax Premier.  It just gets better.
0,"This suite consists of 4 programs:<br />1. DVD to iPad converter<br />2. DVD Creator<br />3. iPad Video Converter<br />4. iPad Transfer Platinum<br /><br />You get a email with a registration code for each program. Each registration code is 64 characters long. The first time you use the program you have to type in your email address and copy and paste the appropriate registration code.<br /><br />The DVD to iPad program works fine although it took over three hours to convert an hour and fifteen minute video.<br /><br />However, the iPad Transfer program &#34;failed&#34; (their term) every time I tried to transfer a DVD video they converted on my Windows 7 computer to my iPad. The message was something like their program was not compatible with the new iOS 7. What? This software package just became available and iOS 7 is six months old. I found another way to transfer the converted videos to my iPad using an app called VLN.<br /><br />In my opinion, this software package is not for the novice computer person. In addition, it seems a little disingenuous for the software maker not to specify upfront what programs you are getting. In addition to have one of the key programs fail? Come on!<br /><br />Way over priced for the little value you are getting."
0,It is definitely not as intuitive as TurboTax. I didn't feel confident in the results like I did last year when I used Turbo Tax. I'm giving it 3 stars because it did work (I guess) but I won't buy it next year.
1,My tax return was completed quickly.  I like all the questions the tax software has to maximize the return.<br />Filing my return was simple and easy.
1,This software is great.  Buying this way was very easy.
1,Yes.. I did fill up my expectations... Also great costumer services by magix company...
1,"Good product, very easy to use. I buy it every year. I cant say there is much of a difference between this and TaxCut except that I always find this cheaper."
1,Perfect editor for special effects and more--love it love it love it
1,"Pretty easy to use. I have only used it for basic video editing so far, when i get some more time i plan on trying out some other functions."
0,"I have used Quicken for 20 years now, and upgrade versions every year.  Upgrades always went well until the move from 2009 to 2010, and they've been getting worse every year.  Upgrade to 2013 is no exception.<br /><br />The worst part about all of this is that when you upgrade, your data is converted -- so there is no going back.  Don't tell me about backups -- I backup my data to 9 different hard drives every time I make a change to my Quicken data file.  The issue is that the data is converted, and no longer backward-compatible, so once you have converted -- and then commence to make any additions to your data -- there is just no going back (unless, of course, you keep an older version running on a different computer, and replicate EVERY transaction in both versions in parallel -- how long you think that'll work and keep them both accurate?).<br /><br />Anyway, when I upgraded from 2009 to 2010, all 42 of my online repeating payments got screwed up.  Quicken's solution -- delete them all, and re-enter them.  Note that that required deleting and re-entering in BOTH Quicken and the bank, since 2010 would not download the existing repeating transactions from the bank.  Well -- it downloaded a few of them -- but -- would you trust that going forward?  For the next 4 months after recreating all these transactions, I manually confirmed each and every one of them, each and every month, between the Quicken screen and the bank's screen, to be sure they were working, that the payments had happened, that I didn't end up with any late payments  .......<br /><br />Well, in the 2010 to 2011 upgrade -- guess what -- the same thing happened again.  Another 4 months of manual confirmation after over 40 transactions were manually deleted and re-entered.<br /><br />So -- along came 2013 upgrade.  This time the repeating transactions actually transferred over, except now there are some that have expired (they were for a set time, the last payment has been made) -- and they won't disappear from my automatic payment listing.  I CANNOT make them go away, I CANNOT delete them -- so now I am manually confirming every month that the bank is not sending multiple payments to the utility company, cable company, etc.  There are a couple of \\""ghost\\"" repeating online payments that do not show up in the scheduled transaction lists that regularly show up in my check register though -- so I have to confirm that those payments aren't real every month too.<br /><br />Further, the reports function just simply does not work.  The ad hoc reports produce garbage, don't include the right information, do include wrong information, selecting by category or account etc just doesn't filter the right data.  The custom reports that I had set up and used for years, and which had survived the version upgrades successfully over the years -- did not survive the 2013 upgrade.  I can't recreate them because the reports function in 2013 is just plain BROKEN.  Back to Excel.<br /><br />Transactions do not reliably download from the bank's website when the accounts are updated.  Most do, but not all.  Somehow other computers are not satisfied with being close -- at least not *my* credit card company.  So, reconciling accounts is a major chore to ferret out the missing, and all too often duplicated, transactions that are found in the registers.  Doing a \\""One Step Update\\"" is always an adventure because the passwords stored in the password vault don't always work -- some do, some don't, never the same ones -- and evidently, sometimes they must hammer away at trying to get access so many times that I get locked out of the website for too many invalid attempts -- I don't find that out until I go to do a manual logon to a site that didn't download correctly, so I can then do a webconnect download, and find that I am locked out, and then have to go through a password reset process with that provider.  Never happened until v2011, but was consistent in v2012.  Still here in 2013.<br /><br />When I called the bank about the downloaded transaction and online repeating payment issues, they pointed the finger at Quicken (and most probably rightly so) -- and forwarded me there.  First thing Quicken did was ask for a credit card number in order to provide product support.  It was going to cost me more for product support, for a brand new product that didn't work as advertised, than it cost to purchase the product in the first place.  After calling that bluff (and I am sure being noted as a bad customer in the process), all the other horror stories about Quicken support were experienced as well -- no follow-up, no feedback, no success.  English as a second language is a minor issue in this disaster.<br /><br />So -- Quicken 2013 really becomes nothing more than a very pretty looking Excel spreadsheet for me -- a fancy check register -- because I no longer trust ANYTHING that it does.  I manually confirm online payments that it sends -- repeating, one-time, or otherwise.  I manually check my bank balances with the bank's webpage, because I do not trust that all transactions are accounted for, and therefore cannot trust the balance shown, nor the forecasted balance for the next 30/60 days.<br /><br />What a great product this used to be.  I've just never figured out how to live without it after relying on it for so long.<br /><br />But -- as I find myself looking for ways to simplify my life, living without Quicken is beginning to enter those thoughts."
1,cleaned up all issues on computers
1,It is great!  Have used it for several years and have never had a virus invade my computer.  It provides a warning when something is threatening.
1,Great!
1,I have used Turbo Tax for years and am very happy with my refunds and the easy process. Great item.
0,"I have been using Quicken for more that five years (after Microsoft Money stopped updating its product) and each time there are problems with the upgrade.  This time the Online update feature, for some unknown reason, garbled all my online banking passwords, to the point that I had to call several banks to get my online access unlocked."
1,A very effective utility
1,The best for the money!!!
1,Never had a problem and works great......Thank you Avast
0,"I've been a Quicken user since 1999 and this is the worst update I've seen. There where do many little glitches with the presentation that it felt like an early beta version. For an established brand releasing a product with so many obvious flaws really damages their credibly. Thankfully many of the issues have been addressed in the seven releases since launch, but not without frustrating many long time customers and dampening the loyalty Quicken had enjoyed."
1,This product really does the job for you and your computer.Robert
0,The good:  Fast results<br />The bad:  Difficult to navigate.  Needs to be more user friendly and intuitive.  I had trouble getting back to items I wanted to change.
1,this is the best security but it can be pricey so I used a cheaper one after it expired but would still recommend it.
1,I am very happy with the new version of<br />quicken it does everything I need and more. Thank you for the update
1,easy to follow
0,"Disappointing!  I've been using Outlook since before 2000 and thought this would be an improvement... Over what, I did not know, but this version did increase that size of the .pst file allowed.  The issue I seem to have is that I can't find how to allow a change in &#34;AutoCorrect&#34; and because of that, there is a huge disconnect between this version and previous!"
1,Tax season gets 1 star... This program gets 5. I have been using HR block from the beginning. The best tax program around.
1,"I little bit of a learning curve, but a good product once you learn how to use it."
0,"I am using this program for a 501(c)(3) form 990 return, and it is one of the most FRUSTRATING experiences I have had in recent memory.  The layout of the interview is inconsistent -- sometimes it asks you the relevant questions, sometimes it says to click on &#34;Whole Form&#34; and enter the information directly on the form, and sometimes it says to click on &#34;Whole Form&#34; and enter the info directly, but when you try to do so, it tells you that you are overriding the interview questions (which don't appear unless you click on the &#34;jump to&#34; button)!<br /><br />There are errors in the return because I can't figure out where to add the right information.  And it says there are errors, but it is difficult to find out what the error actually is and how to fix it.  In addition, there is obviously supposed to be additional information entered into Schedule O, but it doesn't tell me which fields need to have additional information entered there!<br /><br />Terribly unhelpful.  Even though my information is all entered, I am considering ditching what I've already done (even though I already paid for the software) and checking out Turbo Tax instead.<br /><br />I already used the software for my personal tax return.  Although it was accurate, it is not nearly as user friendly as Turbo Tax.  It is not even as user friendly as last year's online version of H&R Block.  I originally switched because Turbo Tax made a significant error on my return (which H&R calculated correctly).  At this point, I may just ditch the whole thing and hire an accountant for our tiny nonprofit return."
1,"Seems to be doing well without piles of commercials.  Not bad so far, I like it."
1,"Gotta love the instant gratification of downloading the software, activating it, and having it up and running in less than 30mins!  Make sure you read the PDF instructions on activating it, otherwise you'll probably become quite frustrated trying to activate the software. Also, IF YOU BOUGHT THE STUDENT EDITION: rather than scanning your school ID and waiting a few days for approval, I recommend using your school email.  They send you a message, which you simply reply to the link in it, and vola! activation within just a few mins."
1,I absolutely love this product.  It totally protects my laptop and warns me of any threats that happen.  I would definitely recommend Avast.  I did recommend it to my cousin and she is using it now.
0,"didn't download, got no help trying to make it work. waste of time and money"
0,I am very disappointed in the mobile app that Quicken advertises as being able to see your data on your Android or ios device.  I assumed that that would mean all of the data you have not just your bank account.  The main reason I upgraded from 2012 Quicken was to be able to see my stock portfolio I have on my home computer Quicken while I was traveling.  It will not do your stocks even though you pay a premium for Quicken Premier when you buy it.  I would assume most other users who do their stock portfolio's on Quicken want to be able to sync or see it on your tablet device.  This is a MAJOR disappointment and therefore I cannot recommend this upgrade.
1,Fantastic. .
1,"The product seems to be working as advertised.  I installed this product on a Windows 8, 7, and Vista machine without any problems."
0,"I had this software dumped on my computer when I ordered a free e-book from Rhodes Breads. It appears to be a limited version, but I would never upgrade after my limited experience. Starting the program is painfully slow, and I get error messages from a frown face with \\""We're sorry. Something has gone wrong\\"" to the regular HTML 404 error messages while trying to navigate the recipes.  It looks a little like software I used 10 years ago and could use a more modern look. All of the recipes I click on in one section have the 404 error message. It also got hung up trying to shut it down and had to force close it. What a  mess. My favorite experience was receiving an email from the creator telling me to give it a 5 star rating and not give anything lower than 4 star without contacting him first."
1,does the job for me and didn't break the bank.  no complaints on it after purchasing and downloading it through amazon.
1,big ol refund nice and quick.  :)
1,"I use their products every year and there are always some annoyances. I was going to move to Turbotax but having done last years in the H&R program this was the easiest way to get it done this year. TurboTax for the Mac will not import H&R 2012 tax files. By the way save this right now to your wish list as there are so many versions of this you may not find this one that lets you download the mac version-Fed-State. And NOTE this a version in same color box that is less money but it does not include the state. If you need State get it in this one. Look at box is has Federal and State listed and checked.<br /><br />Note -- > print your activation code that comes with the install when presented (though you can get again later from AMAZON if you lose it)<br /><br /> So I will list what I found so far :<br /><br />The first time you run it it will automatically check for Federal Updates. Do NOT do it then, cancel. Until you complete the ACTIVATION it will  crash. This could be fixed, but they never do from year to year is seems to be the same.<br /><br />After activation the Federal update will work. Be advised it take s a long time as it \\""checks\\"". Since there are no indications that things are going fine as it goes along, it appears it is hung. Nope, just takes a long time. I think it takes long because there are no  2013 tax returns to find yet.<br /><br />As far as I remember, the above has always been this case from year to year and it makes a new or inexperienced user concerned right from the start.<br /><br />One more note- if you have to do more than one State (such as you live in one and work in another) I would not use this product. My experience is that it never handles it well and there is great chance of errors the way it is designed. Plus it starts to cost so much you might as well just go and have someone do your returns for just a little more money."
0,Was unable to file my state taxes due to an issue with the software.  Now I here that my data may have been compromised due to a security issue with the Turbo Tax product.  Definitely will think twice before using this product in the future.  Didn't think HR Block had a chance in this arena? Think again.
0,it isnot what I expected to be like.  I cant find what to look for.  P cant find the info .
0,the program has plenty of functional plugins you can download. but the loops and samples it comes with aren't very good. if you want that garage band feel i would recommend saving your pennies and checking out mix-craft pro 6 instead
1,"AVAST... what a great product, the BEST free antivirus you will ever use. Great updates, and notifications. All my family and friends have this product on &#34;ALL&#34; their computers and taps.<br /><br />Thank you AVAST!<br /><br />John"

0,"I've used Quicken for 4 years and it is a useful product and it does save me money.  However, Quicken home and business 2013 adds no features I need and it was a hassle to install.  The fonts were screwed up on my screen, I lost many pre-assigned categores, and some of the info on my investment holdings was messed up.<br /><br />Why can't Quicken just keep the current product working well????<br /><br />I only bought Quicken 2013 because of Quicken's required every three year purchase for support.  If that isn't the case for you, hold off on buying it."
1,"I have this for all of my home computers. You have no idea how much you need great anti virus software. I had a 2 day lapse in my protection and I got 2 nasty viruses. The only way to get rid of them is to pay over $100 to have them removed. Don't let your protection expire, EVER!"
1,Everything I ever wanted in a photo editing software and more.  Absolutely Amazing.  It is easy for beginners and there are many many tutorials on youtube about how to use it and do different things with it (including losing 10 pounds or 50 pounds by clicking a few points.
1,"I've used the free version of avast for many years now, and its been consistently good. It doesn't slow down any reasonable system (it does slow down my netbook, but that thing has a weak Atom processor and very little RAM - everything slows it down), nor is it intrusive or overbearing."
1,Found it to be as good as any attorney would do and for a fraction of the cost. As long as you have it  witnessed and notorized it is completely legal.It tool my husband and me 2 Sundays to fill in the information and made an appointment to have it notorized.
0,I generally use Turbo Tax program but was very disturbed to recently learn that even those customers that kept their information on their desktop computers had their information stored on Intuit servers.  This is truly disgusting and should not be allowed without prior consent.  I would like to email them about this but no email is available.  Very disappointed in this
0,"2011 runs fine on my win7 system, but not 2014?<br />I have spent 3 - 4 hours with intuit tech support via chat and phone to get nowhere with this download.<br />They were supposed to escalate to the next level, but I have never heard back from them."
0,"I downloaded the free trial. It installed an old(er than what I had) version of MS V C+++ runtime. And then failed to install. Multiple times. Unwilling to put more effort into it from there. Support is garbage: well, if you buy it, we can assure you it will work. No thanks. Your trial should work and if it doesn't, there's no reason to send you money. I can write a converter in 'C' with less aggro than talking to tech support requires. Garbage product by a garbage company.<br /><br />Not running (couldn't even install) on Win 8.1x64.

My situation is very straight forward so I guess this would have worked for me in the past also. Because so many people were upset by the lack of sched C filing in this years Deluxe version, and abandoning TT in droves, they are offering a free upgrade to Home and Business for return Deluxe customers. I suppose I do not qualify for this because I have been buying the more expensive and, for me, unecessary version, for years. Therefore I am not a \\""returning\\"" TT Deluxe customer.    Aside from this I have always hated the difficulty of finding real customer support and instead being directed to the \\""community forum\\"" that has for the most part been a waste of time. Two years ago I found a glitch in the software that has probably been costing me money for years. I spent hours on the phone explaining it and I wonder, and doubt, that it was ever corrected.    Finally, I just read that many states will no longer accept Turbo Tax E-filing because of large amounts of fraudulent filings resulting from stolen personal data (but not stolen from Turbo Tax).    This year I will save some money and give HR Block software a try."
1,"Easy and intuitive, every form or screen was guided so didn't feel lost of confusing. I have also crossed check with other software and the results were same."
1,"Great, and it's FREE!"
0,It won't run on my system. Keeps giving me error messages. I am asking for a refund. Quicken 13 worked just fine. Quicken 14 has not worked yet.
1,"Worth every penny. Converts almost every file format that I know of. Easy to convert DVD to digital copy for my Zune and my Girlfrien's Ipod Nano (MP4). Make sure you save it somewere you won't loose it. Burn it on a CD if you have to. Just in case you have to reformat your computer, buy a new computer or Lightling strikes! Stay away from those free downloaders. It's a waste of time and energy. Your paying for a Reliable Name Brand and free from any adware or spyware."
1,It was exactly what I expected. Have been using quicken for over 10 years n love it. Helps with keeping tract of everything
0,I am quite unhappy because can not use outlook...  The price was Ok but they did not say than outlook was not in the package...  I didnt like it!!!
0,"I use it because I have to, but my favorite is 2003.  I preferred the older menu structure, ‘File, Edit, View…..’  It was a lot easier for me.  Every version since 2007 gets worse…."
0,"The product itself is pretty good, until you discover the fact that after you purchase it you have to CALL them to get an \\""activation code\\"".<br />First 6 times I called the wait time was 45 minutes, the next it said that I would have to call again another time. I finally got thru after a 20 minute wait. The (difficult to understand overseas) operator gave me a code, which didn't work, game me another which also didn't work. He finally had to \\""take control of my computer\\"" to download and install a patch for the registration file on the program. WTF?!?! After over an hour on the phone with him it finally was registered. I truely feel that this software contains a built-in time bomb that self destructs after a certain date, by giving you critical errors during important tasks (like filing your taxes), and the ONLY way to fix it is to download a newer version of the software. When it works, it's great though. Take that for what it's worth. Wish there was a better option out there."
0,This program is clunky and does not have a media management area.  And it does not play as many formats as it says it does.
1,This antivirus is very effective and has prevented my PC from getting infected numerous times. It also let me know when it has updated my antivirus. I highly recommend this program.
1,Awesome app for the entire family but don't buy it because its one for test. Works for Windows OS but not for OSX. Did not work on XP but worked on Windows 8.
0,I have not been able to use this software. the calculations are coming up wrong. I'm trying to find out who to call R if if you need to send me a new software package
0,Spent hours trying to get this done.  Key does not work.  shows:  INVALID.  Waste of time.
0,Turbo Tax is a nice and easy format to follow.  The reason I gave it only a 3 is because they have no way to pay the tax without an outside party and an additional fee.  The fee that Turbo Tax wants to charge is almost 1% higher than can be found outside their system.  It was cumbersome to figure out how to proceed in order to use that outside source instead of lining their pockets.  I will look else where next year.
1,Things makes life so much simpler and easier knowing that with a click of a button you can update your transaction from your bank and know where your money is going and where it has went.  I have used several different versions for a PC and it seemed that you could never use all the features.  I Blamed it on the program but I think it was a PC thing.  That is not the case with this version for the Mac.  Now if it could only make dinner?
1,"Very helpful, the section on ira's confused me alitte"
1,"So far so good, I switched from Norton Security because of this year's higher price. I don't want a zillion security features - I use some other applications to take care of some of the other protection and wanted the basic anti-virus without all the frills and McAfee delivered. Installation was easy and relatively trouble-free - one of the computers froze up a bit at one point, but running the installer again was successful.<br /><br />The only thing keeping it from a 5-star rating is the Site Advisor. Norton has something similar but McAfee's has some kind of bug with Firefox that periodically displays Chinese characters over the browser's tabs. It also has some goofy behavior, putting its logo within a page's content.  The Chinese character issue is a well known problem from what I can tell, but has yet to be fixed. However, disabling Site Advisor was easy - McAfee has instructions posted. It's not a huge loss.<br /><br />All in all, it's been a solid performer - I'm not seeing performance slowdowns and the scanning is done nicely in the background.<br /><br />This is the first McAfee product I've used, and it seems under the Intel umbrella it's getting better."
1,Turbo Tax was easy to understand.  The process of filing my taxes was quick and trouble free. I felt completely at ease
1,Quick and easy. Made filing much easier.
1,Great program; it does just what it should.  I particularly like the Boot Time Scan.  That scans before the operating system starts and can get rid of malware you can't get rid of otherwise.
1,"There are some differences in the Mac version compared to windows. As a result, there is some learning that has taken place. The installation went smothly. Our use has been limited to date but, no problems have been encountered."
1,i am very impressed with the easy menu's and how professional your video's can be. I have used professional programs before but this one is very easy and with a little experience you are creating wonderful video's
1,I have been using avast! Free Antivirus for years and have had no problems with my computer.  Great product and it's free!  CNET.com gives good rating too.  Plus if you want more protection you can always upgrade.
1,I trust few if any others like I do Avast!
0,"My husband owns a pc repair business and we run it out of our home.  I first came upon this when we were working on a customer's Kindle. It was free, reviews were good. I put it on our personal Kindles as well. Love it, does what it is supposed to, hangs out in the background; exactly what an antivirus is supposed to do. I figured it was available for pc, too, but wondered about the cost, & other factors. Lo & behold, found the freebie version here at Amazon! Excellent!  UPDATE!!!! Pretty easy to install, and I figured I would get it for my other pcs, all running Norton, which is good, but a huge resource hog. Installation went fine, I got Norton out, no issues. First scan went ok, no problems, didn't think there would be. I need to add at the time all this was going on, Microsoft had sent out a system update. So, when I shut down, it did its update. No issues appeared when I turned pc on next day, er, visible issues; anyway. Except I noticed on the taskbar, my internet status and volume control were gone! Yep, just gone....That's a little inconvenient. My system is wireless, so it should have been there, nothing was changed. As for volume control, I couldn't imagine what happen. After an hour or so,I gave up and called in the expert! My husband restored system for me, which took out Eset, & update. Everything was back where it needed to be. So was Norton. We had a hard time getting rid of Norton, had to manually go in and delete it. Had to restart, which put update back in. Volume & internet status remained where they needed to be. I can't give this product the review I wanted to, but the were several other factors to consider. I am not currently using Eset on the pcs as I wanted to, lets just say that."
1,"download went great.  easy to load on my daughter's computers at school, halfway across the state. also mixed OS: OS-X, Win XP, Vista, Win-8.1"
1,I like this program because it is easy to use. I also liked the process of setting the program up.
1,Excellent software. Worked perfectly when I downloaded gave me all the updates in a timely manner and is pretty useful to find out other items that I have questions on.
0,"First of all, I would avoid any reviews that are more than a couple of months old. They do not appear to reflect the current state of affairs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Amazon Cloud Drive.<br />1. The product simply isn't usable in its current state. The main issue I have is that there is no way to merge files from multiple locations. Let's say I have a Music directory with a Led Zeppelin directory in side it and in there I have the &#34;I&#34; album as MP3. I upload the whole thing to ACD. So far so good. Tomorrow I buy the &#34;II&#34; album as MP3. I can upload the Led Zeppelin directory but then it is just up there by itself. If I try to move it to my &#34;Music&#34; directory, I get the following prompt:<br />&#34;Move Name Conflict. The destination directory already has a file named: ... What do you want to do with the new file? [Skip]&#34; That's right, your only option is to skip. You cannot merge two directories together without doing it one file or directory at a time. It is absurd. Whoever designed this should be fired immediately.<br /><br />2. Amazon Cloud Drive is a separate service from Amazon Music. Sure you can download the stuff from AM and then upload it to ACD but what's the fun in that? And if you want to be able to hear your all your MP3s in AM, that is a separate subscription and you have to upload them again.<br /><br />The only way to make this work reasonably is to create a single drive that hosts your backup volume and periodically upload the whole thing to ACD. (Otherwise you'll be dealing with merge conflicts and folder micromanagement.) This does not work for me because I do not have particularly fast uploads or a drive big enough to host my entire backup locally.<br /><br />I can accept the lack of synchronization. In fact I don't actually want that feature because my archives are currently spread across multiple drives and there isn't space on any one device to synchronize a single drive. I don't want files disappearing because they don't happen to appear on one particular drive.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I gave these guys 90 days to get this fixed. They didn't. I have canceled my subscription."
0,"Let me start out by saying that Intuit destroyed this years version of Turbo Tax. If you don't want to have Intuit electronically file your State return, Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 Federal and State contains errors that prevents it from generating a usable copy of my Ohio state tax return that can be filed by mail.<br /><br />Once again the folks who brought you Turbo Tax decided to quietly annoy their loyal customers by making a questionable decision to alter their product in a detrimental way. Many years ago it was adding copy protection that only ended up interfering with their customers ability to install the product. This time it was to quietly remove functionality from the program without telling anyone.  This was followed by an unapologetic apology, that was followed by an apology for the apology, stating they would return Turbo Tax back to its original state. Unfortunately, in this change in design, and quick hustle to change back , they broke what used to be a robust and reliable program.<br /><br />Here are some images that show my experience with Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014.<br /><br />1. After downloading the Turbo Tax Installer and running it, Turbo Tax said I had to uninstall a previous version. The first picture shows the crash that followed this operation.<br /><br />2. Next I re-ran the downloader. This time Turbo Tax continued with the install, but said I was installing the Basic version.<br /><br />3. After completing my tax return, I tried to print copies of my returns for my records. This is what the State form looked like. It was watermarked with huge words saying the tax form was not final. How could it be not final when I had already completed my return and submitted the forms electronically.<br /><br />4. Lastly, Turbo Tax never actually generated an Ohio State form that looks like the Ohio tax document so I could mail in my tax return. What it did do was regenerate the Federal 1040 form along with my other state documents, even though I only had the State form selection checked when I told it to create a preview copy of my Ohio tax return.<br /><br />With all these managerial and software design mistakes, Turbo Tax has plummeted from being the flagship Tax Preparation software, to something I'd be ashamed to offer people as a free-ware program.eate a preview copy of my Ohio tax return.    With all these managerial and software design mistakes, Turbo Tax has plummeted from being the flagship Tax Preparation software, to something I'd be ashamed to offer people as a free-ware program."
0,"I am presently on the phone with microsoft for over one hour trying to get microsoft to update my credit card information.  Every time I use a microsoft product I regret it any time I need service. Finally after 1 hour and fifteen minutes they told me I have to use a different credit card although my original card was valid.  They gave me one month credit for the time I spent on the phone.   That experience was with the Phillipines.  The service manager asked if everything was ok.  I said, if you get me an engineer to help me with a few things I'll be ok.  But make it simple.  I spent 15 minutes waiting to get someone from India who couldn't speak English.  I told her to get me someone from the United States.  It's now 20 minutes and waiting.   I just keep hearing the american voices from apple in my head.  Unfortunately at this point I'm stuck with Microsoft at work.  It's now 22 minutes and I'm starting to boil.  How long does it take to transfer a call from India to the US.  The point is that the product is good if you know how to use it. but don't expect any decent help from Microsoft.  Your on your own with this product."

0,"I have been using Quicken since MS-DOS days.  I love the online banking feature; so I have used several of the Quicken versions as you are forced to upgrade about every 3 years to maintain this feature.  I have always thought the program was good and at times . . . great software.  However, 2014 Deluxe is poor at best.  I have experienced lots of bugs and glitches.  The application locks up or starts asking me questions about accounts that I have had inactive for years.  When it does this, I have to close out and restart.  When using Quicken 2014, I back-up before and after each use - to two separate files as I am worried it will lose/corrupt my data.  To be fair, this has not actually happened but I do not have any level of confidence that it would not.<br /><br />It is entirely possible I may have a unique issue caused by my hardware, transfer of data from previous versions, overall data file size, ancient Indian burial ground, whatever.  I only know the previous versions ran well/fine on the same hardware and data.<br /><br />As I said earlier,  I have used multiple versions of Quicken over the years and for the most part been happy.  I will likely upgrade when future versions become available."
1,Quick and easy....great program and easy to use.  Upgraded from Quicken 2010 after computer crash.  No problems .  Highly recommend.
1,Turbo-Tax has always done the right job and gotten me the refunds I deserved.
1,"Love this software, been using it for 20 years now.  Never an issue with it or errors on my taxes in that time."

0,"I only updated because I was forced; the license for downloading from banks, credit cards, etc., expired.  Otherwise, there is little difference in this product than with Quicken 2012.<br /><br />Be warned: this product has a glitch.  Back everything up before you install it.  If you have a password on your old files, the new version won't open them.  The only way to get the old files is to restore a back up version and remove the password.<br /><br />Frankly, if I had not been using Quicken for decades, I would switch to something new.  The only reason to by this is because of the expiration of the old license."
1,"Works just as good as the ones you pay for, you can get a free version or upgrade for more features.  I would say try it you will love it."
1,Good product.  Pretty easy to install.
1,its ok
0,Purchasing on done did not seem to save any money.  The price was the same in several stores.  I guess the only benifitr was the convenience of being able to download.  I have been using Turbo Tax for a number of years and find it quite easy to work with.
0,"After several years of inertia, I am finally going to make the switch to other software. Got the deluxe version, updated it and when it came to investments, I went to upgrade to Premier. Based on the TurboTax's Bob's feedback on reviews here, I was expecting the software would seamlessly download all the forms that Deluxe had in the past. But, instead it wants to go through the ordering process and wants to charge $32... something to my card. Why ? Thanks for just the lip service on this website Mr Bob. The experience is making me think twice on whether I should get another Intuit product ie Quicken."
1,Excellent value & my computer needed it. Product was easy to download- I purchased the digital download and it came w/ a code for 5 devices. Easy to install & use.
0,"TurboTax blew it this year.  They deleted the ability to download 1099 forms from Investment firms so I had to buy TurboTax premier to do that, but before I installed it, they restored the ability to download these forms.  The cycling was a pain in the but and cost me several trips to the post office to buy and return CDs that I thought I needed or didn't need, all to do what I had been doing for years with the Deluxe version.  I like the software but TurboTax needs to quit gouging its customers, both on cost and products.  I suspect there will be quite a large number of ex-TurboTax customers either this year or next.  I think the product works well now, but buyer beware.  Alternatives are available and may be worth investigating this year."
1,"QB is not for all companies, but it is enough for most. Great price and value"
1,This is great product. This is the only product I use to protect my system. I research and compare pricing before I make a purchase. Since I purchased this item I have enjoyed the use and the price was exceptional.
1,It is too bad that TurboTax made changes in the program originally designed for Deluxe User's WITHOUT proper prior notice to loyal users.  That was a big mistake and speaks loads to a claim of greed by the company.  That is the reason I gave them a four star rating.  I like the product.  I dislike the company's sneaky way of jacking the price for the SAME product.  They realized the mistake in their move too late and offered apologies and refunds.  You can't unring a bell!
1,I love it
1,"Have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years. Amazon made it easy to get this year by instant download. Thorough and easy to use software for hte do-it-yourselfer. I tried CPA once, and they didn't get me more refund. Instead - they got me the only IRS audit I've ever had. Turbo Tax is the easiest way to file taxes until we get real tax reform :)"
0,"I had used Quicken 18 months ago and found it difficult to get the software to automatically log in to my bank and credit card accounts to download information. Today after getting the newest Quicken version, it was impossible. I only succeeded in getting one of six accounts to work, and that was etrade, not a bank or credit card. I was so frustrated I gave up and tried mint dot com. Their web site worked flawlessly and I got all of the accounts up and running in less than half an hour. How can a relatively new site do this, but a major company like Intuit, with a product that should be so well established fail completely? The only redeeming factor was that I got the Quicken Deluxe on sale for about half price here at Amazon.   If you want to have automated updates of account balances and transactions, I would strongly recommend against buying this."
1,always worked for me everytime. I have a lot of computers used for various projects and when I need online protection Avast has always installed quickly and without the hassle of a lot of add-ons that will annoy you later down the road.
1,Awsome!
1,I don't trust any other tax program to do my taxes.  Turbo Tax rocks and is nearly fool-proof.
1,Good
0,"I was ineligible for the $25.00 refund due to having used Premier last year (and the last 5 years before that)...buyer beware. I agree with the price gouging comments, there are more economical options out there:    H&R Block:  http://amzn.com/B00PG8FOSY  TaxAct:  [...]"
1,"I love when bug companies care about students, I started to study photography and Adobe Photoshop is a must have."
1,"Well, several people have complained about major issues with this item but in all honesty I cannot say that I am one. I DID have one little delay but it was not bad.<br /><br />Setting up the main account was easy. The download happened in a short enough time, considering its an entire suite being downloaded straight from Microsoft's site. The little delay came when I was trying to add my first addition user. I was taken to a page which sent a verification code to a cell number I provided. It took me 3 tries (clicking &#34;please resend code&#34;) before I eventually go a code that worked but after that, it was smooth sailing. The 3 additional users were all able to download the suite immediately and with no freezes, etc.<br /><br />So I have to conclude that the product (for the most part) worked. However, because it often pulls from online (Microsoft's site), you may experience some 4-5 second delays (between tasks) if you have a slow internet connection. That's why I gave it 4 stars."
0,Norton Security will not install on Mac unless/until Little Snitch is uninstalled. That is unacceptable and needs to be documented in the sales literature.
1,I'm very delighted with Quicken 2015!
0,"We got this software so my mother could track her expenses, etc, for a piece of rental property she bought 6 months ago.<br /><br />I'm no newcomer to computers; I've been working with them since the mid '70's--and this is the single most frustrating piece of software I've ever (tried to) use.<br /><br />I've spent close to 6 hours over two days trying to figure out how to do something as simple as enter a mortgage payment.  Turns out you can't just make the entry in a register...no, you have to set up some kind of automatic payment and enter it from THERE.  (And good luck trying to edit the principal and interest amount from other than what Quicken insists on calculating FOR you.)<br /><br />An absolutely infuriating waste of time."
0,"I filed 3 tax returns using this software and all 3 were delayed due to to the Form 8863 not being filled out properly. Over 600,000 people were affected by this, which was ENTIRELY the fault of H&R BLOCK, but they refuse to give a refund for the software because I purchased it slightly more than 60 days ago (again, due to THEIR error it has been delayed this long)! I have purchased their software for the past 5 years because Amazon has a great price that allows you to submit up to 5 returns but I will never use this awful software again! I am extremely disappointed with the situation!"
1,I have always been satisfied using this product.  It is easy to do and I feel confident that all will be well.
0,"This is a disgusting piece of garbage. If you think you'll be able to upgrade from an older version - or worse, from a different computer like a Mac - think again. The instructions Intuit provides for transferring your data from Mac to Windows are ridiculously complex, and even if you follow them exactly, it won't work. The QIF import function does not support checking, savings, credit cards, or investment accounts - pretty much everything you'd ever use Quicken for. I just spent $100 for a program that has zero compatibility with previous versions of its own programs, and I feel completely ripped off. Don't waste your time and money with this."
1,Easy to download and use.
1,I love it. It integrates with FB and other social sites. For marketers or those buying leads this program is a must have.
0,"Doesnt work nearly as well as I thought it would..... Very disappointed..... Now prove that this concerns you.. In Christ and Happy, Sutton, Wm Pastor95@aol.com Col 2:6"
1,Install was easy and less issues than 360.
1,Yup.  Download and start using it now.<br />What's better?<br /><br />What's better is Intuit not killing my ability to do Bank downloads at the 3 year mark.<br />There was no reason for me to upgrade other than the bank downloads stopped working.
0,This Quick Book application is more than I need for my home accounting use. Th would be great for a home business where there are multiple accounts to manage..
0,GOOD!
0,I downloaded the new upgrade and found that it is essentially the same product.  The only difference was the mobile abilities which I have no use for.  I have no idea why anyone would be wanting to do their finances and reconcile their bank accounts on a mobile phone screen where you can only see a portion or its so small you need a magnifying glass. I could possibly see someone trying to use a tablet but they really aren't geared for those doing serious work unless you have fully loaded Surface which wouldn't require an upgrade anyway.<br /><br />I think they should have allowed those people who are wanting mobile to be able to purchase and download a separate app instead of having all of us buy a new product that is the same as the previous. I was very angry that the only changes were cosmetic with no real substance and that I paid $50 for it. I feel as if I have subsidized the cost of the mobile use for those silly enough to want it.<br /><br />A real rip off.  Shame on Quicken.  Makes me want to ditch it and use a software from a more reputable company.
0,"Of the large tech companies, Nuance has one of the worst customer services known.  The core, excellent product was basically ripped off from a Cambridge husband & wife team decades ago & has become a perpetual marketing vehicle ever since.  It has the same abysmal lack of attention to detail and consumer indifference that Microsoft has made infamous.  Every new version is &#34;25%&#34; faster than the one before, until you look at the real numbers, which are second decimal place-sized improvements.  Schlock management; fundamentally a good product with many operational flaws that never get fixed as they have no competition."
1,"The product was very easy to use, extremely helpful in discovering all of the deductions, and displayed a sense of humor through it all."
1,Turbo Tax has always been good.  I thought there was a rebate offer this year for regular users.  Do I qualify?
0,"I found this product to be inadequate. Norton used to have a great reputation that is the reason I have been with them so long.<br />A virus that had been on the loose for a while attacked my machine and Norton Antivirus failed to stop it. That was just one of my complaints about Norton Antivirus.<br />They also have the worse customer service and tech support I have every dealt with. After their inadequate virus database allowed the virus to attach itself to my system they refused to assist in the removal. They were forcing me to go to a service that would make me pay for their negligence.<br />After I informed them I refused to pay for their failure the games began. I spent over 3 ½ hours on the phone waiting on hold, and disagreeing with customer  service and tech support. They kept me on hold once for 1 ½ hours before I hung up, they disconnected my call, they transferred me around from one department to another. I talked to over 5 people and kept getting the run around.<br />I will never use Norton Antivirus again and will inform everyone I know about their shoddy product and service. Sometimes companies get to big and forget the importance of customer support."
0,"I'm on my third phone call to activate my Amazon purchased payroll key. First you must find the phone number and then hope you are not hung up on. Seriously. The automated voice tells you to go to the support site and find the appropriate number to call for support. The appropriate number repeats this message when you call. I can only assume this screwing with customers is to facilitate Intuit's double-priced auto renew program.<br />PS Intuit has figured a way to scam our credit card numbers: You must pay a monthly fee for anything over a single employee. I know that next year I will be charged full price for payroll and have to go through hell to get a refund.<br />Scum.<br />As for the software: I needed to revise a 941. HAH! Good luck with that. Intuit wouldn't tell me, nor is it in their support, on how to do it. I figured out the different tax form number (no help from software) but  Intuit would only partially complete the tax form and it was up to me  to do the math  (just what you want when dealing with the IRS) and print it (no efile allowed for no known reason)."
0,...but it will not install on my computer after several attempts.  Seems like it shouldn't be this hard.  Oh well maybe there's something else out there.
1,I have used Quicken products for a number of years and have always been happy with the product.  When I purchased this product through Amazon I was not dissapointed.  I would be glad to recommend this to a friend.
1,It is okay I have finally learn how to do certain things but other not yet I wish there were some instructions on how to reconcile the statements. I wish I could figure out how to set the budget info for starters. I just need a few pieces of information and I could be on my way. It is very different from a pic version and I had no idea what this version would be like
0,"Before explaining how buying the Premiere Elements 9 download from Amazon was a complete disaster for me, I want to make it clear that I cannot claim my experience to be typical for other buyers.

What the outcome of all this was or will be is of course something I won't be privy to.<br /><br />THE WORST PART - In the wake of trying to get this OEM download to work, and Adobe doing all sorts of tweaks to my system - my beautiful, expensive new computer is totally messed up.

0,"This has been a bit of a nightmare. I bought the product a week ago. When I attempted to use the key to install from their website, it didn't work. It only installed a part of their program not the Total Protection. I worked with their support team and had to give them access to my computer for over an hour- no install. Then I had to wait two more days for another technical support person- again, have to give them access to my machine for well over an hour. They were making so many tweaks and adjustments to my machine, I couldn't keep up. I would suggest going with something easier to work with. I already regret not just paying the extra money for Norton."
0,"Used this the past few years, but due to their new pricing I have switched to HR Block, which is much more reasonably priced."
1,It was what I needed for a great price!! I went back and purchased another.
1,"I liked the software in terms of its simplicity of use unlike the manual way (paperworks) of filling up forms for tax refund.<br />It gives you a quick view of the amount you'll be getting and there's no need to compute--it will do it on its own. and with this deluxe edition, both state and federal taxes could be done and both be filed online. If you want to save money in filing taxes rather than have someone do it for you for a specific fee, this is recommended. Of course there would be no comparison if you'd get the same amount if you'd use another software but if you do have someone who uses another product, you can try it if its indeed better than other softwares."
1,I have used this product for many years and it works great.  I bought it from this venue because the price was great.
0,"Not for anyone that really wants to manipulate images. Can't cut out any geometric shapes, no tool. No edge finder for cutting out, have to rely on a smooth hand and a good mouse. Not at all intuitive. Poor help file. Find another product. Complete waste of money. Gave it two stars only because you can actually open up images."
1,"I've been using TurboTax Deluxe for several years now and I think it's great!  I had no problems downloading the product (Windows XP) or installing it.  The one thing I really like about it is the automatic update feature.  When I run the software, if there are any updates for the program, forms, etc., it automatically asks me if I want to download and install them which I do so I have the most current versions of everything.  Years ago I used to do my taxes manually spending literally hours filling out worksheets to see if I qualified for a particular deduction and how much I could deduct.  Having seen many TV advertisements for TurboTax, I decided to try it.  Boy oh boy, what a difference in the time it took to prepare my taxes.  I don't have a real complicated return, at least I don't think I do, but TurboTax found deductions I wasn't even aware of or that I qualified for.  If you can read, follow directions and answer all the questions honestly, I think TurboTax is the only way to go to get your maximum refund."
1,Quite easy to use and forms mode allows one to use only the options you need without dealing with all the questions.
1,We are happy with Turbo Tax and I really like the bonus feature with Amazon.
0,Really bad font makes this hard to read.  It's not any faster than just using Lotus Notes search.  Save your money.

1,I have been recommending Avast to many of my customers that I repair their computers. Many of them have gone ahead and purchased the Internet Security package.
1,Good Software
1,Can't beat the price and this gives me a decent level of protection.  It was recommended to by a computer technician and I'm happy with the product
1,I've used Avast for over 2 years with zero problems. Effectively does it's job...
1,"so much easier to use than I ever thought possible.  Anyone can use it right from the start. But just in case, comes with a handy manual!~"
1,awesome
0,"I have been using photoshop for years.  The original price was steep but since older versions work fine for my needs, I have no reason to upgrade. I have only done so a couple of times over the past decade.  Well, Adobe just assured that I will never upgrade again because they want to charge you forever.  Great deal for them, not for the customer."
1,"As a Quicken user since 1993, this software has only gotten better.  I especially like the fact that my mobile Quicken is now properly syncing with the main software.  Life is becoming so much easier than keeping receipts in my wallet until I can get to the main software.  Keep up the good work!!"
0,Over the years this product has become so bloated with &#34;features&#34; that I'm finding it more annoying than useful. Perhaps this will be my last Quicken product. I find it more and more difficult to perform routine tasks.
0,"I actually used this program maybe 20 years ago and purchased it for my son, it's still a great learning tool. But the application is buggy: I can't launch the application until I closed all open applications or it crashes (I'm running 10.6).<br /><br />The other thing I find annoying (and reminds me of really old programs) is on launch the applications has to change the screen resolution, it makes me think the program was designed for a 640x480 screen.<br /><br />But once you get the application going it's still a great teaching tool. In the lower right is a representation of your hands over the keyboard that show's correct hand positions and it shows the key you hit. The lessons are progressive, adding keys as you go along and they make learning fun. They also have arcade games that my 10 year old son enjoys.<br /><br />I started out my son on some free online typing games but they don't shoe proper hand positions and the games aren't progressive or flexible. Mavis Beacon is still a strong learning tool but it needs to be rewritten for today's computers to earn 5 stars."
1,"The program flows well, is easy to navigate and go back and review.  Using the &#34;Guide Me&#34; function really gets to involved for the average tax payer.....just to many unrelated questions for situations that are not going to exist."
1,Just what I needed.
1,"We have had one issue since using Avast; about 4 months after installation there was an error message saying our subscription had expired. We bought a 1 year subscription good for 3 computers. Called Avast, and they were quick to help. But, they had to have a tech reset everything on my computer remotely. Not sure what happened, or why; never got a report from them for anything."
1,muy bueno
1,"I bought it for someone else, so hard to rate accurately, but seemed fine. quick download, tech support was very helpful.  I was surprised at their level of professionalism."
0,"This is not a good way to manage your properties! Go to your local store if you insist on trying it, that way you can return it. Excel documents would work far better. Cannot give discounts or enter multiple months rent at once. Garbage software."
0,"OMG!  I can't believe how slow this version is. I've been a printshop user for many many years and this version 3.5 is really slow for loading projects and clip art etc.  I'm also surprised that the cd/dvd label printing doesn't allow you to print directly on disks. Nowadays most people know that putting stick on labels on disks is bad for the players. I now print directly on my disks. I wish Printshop was faster and more modern. Sorry I purchased my online non-returnable download.  BTW, my computer is super fast and it takes forever for your software to load everything.  Disappointed...."
1,I love these programs that are in this suite. RDF
1,Kaspersky is one of the best security software packages on the market and it's so easy to buy it from Amazon for a great price without having to mail in for rebates. Check surveys if you need a second opinion.
0,"I have requested a refund of this product.  I was using Quicken 2011 with no problems at all, yet was told all support/download capability for it would be going away by April.  I took the plunge and bought 2014 - I can't even register the product without it crashing on me!  After numerous calls to the support center, I was told that many customers are experiencing this issue and developers are working on a solution.  Well, that doesn't help me when I have work to do TODAY in Quicken, so I rolled back to 2011.  Won't be buying this product anytime soon."
1,Ease of use is fantastic. done with taxes in 45 minutes. Love it.
1,"The product works quite well for me on both my desktop and laptop machines.<br /><br />That said, for the second year in a row, I had an annoying time updating my installation. Previously, I'd used the automatic renewal option, which I decided was too costly given the much cheaper rates for the product on Amazon and elsewhere, and things got confusing when I tried to update an installation with another key that I'd had for over four months. The Norton support person eventually had me re-download the product and start the installation from scratch.<br /><br />This most recent time, when I tried to activate the new installation purchased through Amazon, I kept getting the message that my license had expired (0 days left). As it was one of the recommended steps to resolve the problem, I completely uninstalled the product and reinstalled it again three or four more times, but the same message showed up.<br /><br />Of course, I followed the directions that the Norton site provided for inputting the product key, but I never saw where I could put the key in. Finally, I tried live chat. The tech guy eventually had to take over control of my desktop. It turned out that the Norton directions for inputting the key left out a step that was needed on my particular computer. Having done exactly what I'd done several times, the tech guy had to click on the &#34;renew&#34; option on the screen (I could see him moving the cursor around on my screen looking for the key input box that should have been visible before he opted for the renew button). That brought up another similar screen which this time had the proper box for inputting the key.<br /><br />I then installed the product on my notebook computer on my own and the box for the product key was visible when and where it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Interestingly, in all my attempts to install the product on my desktop machine, having clicked the &#34;renew &#34; option several times, and then cancelled out that option, since I'd already purchased the product from Amazon and didn't want to spend $89.99 for the product I'd just paid less than a third as much for, I did at one point see an offer pop up to renew for less than half the price of the usual price Norton was quoting on its renewal page (I think the offer was for $34.99, but I'm not certain).<br /><br />I run Norton 360 on my computers, but I also use the free version of SuperAntiSpywear to hunt down problems, and between the two products I've not had a problem with a virus for some time."
1,I Like it
1,Perfect for keeping my craft business straight. I can just make finances for my business or for my personal needs and it's very easy to use.
1,For the cost you can get a basic program to work you dreams. It perfect to develop a base to give to the experts. Loving it!
0,"There are NO BASIC INSTRUCTIONS!!!..The description of this product is misleading, and deceptive... The video tutorials, while beautifully produced, are nauseatingly verbose, and if they contain the information you are looking for, you will be asleep long before they get to it...They cover in excruciating detail, things that most users will never use...There are NO BASIC INSTRUCTIONS!!!...  Customer service was useless..&#34;caught in a loop&#34; and sends links to help that does not exist... A complete waste of money!!!. IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT HERE, YOU CAN NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!.....I am looking for a way to report Corel to an internet Fraud agency, BBB...and whoever else I can contact... I would not recommend this product, to anyone, not well versed in earlier versions of &#34;Corel&#34; Paint Shop...This product should be advertised to Professional Photographers only!!!..COREL  offers a free trial download....Try that first before purchase!!!..."
0,It looks like Intuit completely replace the budgeting module with one they inherited from their Mint.com purchase. What an excruciating step backwards. It is riddled with bugs and totally unusable. I'm sticking with Quicken 2011 and won't budge until Intuit goes back or else makes dramatic improvements to the budget module.  Microsoft Vista was not this big a disaster.
0,As advertised
1,Good program for the money - it will do nearly anything you want with your loops and recordings - sounds incredible!
0,they suck every penny they can after you pay for the fed they charge you to file the state on line.  BS
1,It downloaded fine. I wish Intuit would stop making it mandatory to rebuy their product every three years. I took off one star for the blackmail Intuit imposes on renewals. But I guess they have to pay bills too. (Triple entendre!)<br /><br />We restored all the accounts with the backup from our copy of Quicken 2010 and it was painless.
1,"I don't know how this app works, and to be honest I don't care. All I know is I woke up one morning with one Mac (super slow), used this application, and had the Macbook Pro that I had when I bought it.<br /><br />I usually don't go for utility software that's 40 bucks, but it's 100% worth it and I'd pay it again. My productivity is very important. It's worth it."
1,"great product when writing papers for school, very easy to use.  very easy to download to my mac  would recommend"
1,I've been doing our family's taxes with Turbo Tax for almost decade now and the program is only getting more stable and keeps adding features to it.<br />I highly recommend this program and filing electronically. After the first year it practically fills itself out.
0,"This is incredibly sad. They are just releasing 2015 software without ANY attempt to fix 2014 software because they are trying to get away from the horrible reviews of 2014. Quicken 2014 is HORRIBLY broken and their fix is to charge us &#62;$100 to buy 2015. Intuit, you do not have Microsoft's monopoly.  If you think 2015 is going to be ANY better than 2014, please know that I have been using this software for 24 years and it is now in such a decline spiral that I can't imagine it recovering.  I haven't felt the need to complain until the 2014 release (suffering in silence like many of you.) I knew it was a bad idea adopting it this early but I needed the tax projection utility.  However, when you enter a transaction in a plain old check register and the running balance is wrong, it is time to complain. Then it becomes necessary to write poor reviews on Amazon when you cannot navigate through the company's web presence nightmare to report a bug. And then when you finally figure out a place to report and you send an incredibly detailed report of what is happening and the (gees I hope it was) robot responds to please send more info, it really is time to complain publicly.  This seems to be one of those releases where there is nothing &#34;gee whiz&#34; to report. I would almost classify it as just a bug release for 2013 but they have broken too many thing to call it a bug fix.  Unless you have some incredibly compelling reason to update, I would stay as far away from this as you can. Wait until you have read somewhere in a big headline that Quicken has heard the wailing and gnashing of teeth and have released nothing but a fix.  Intuit, if you are going to issue messes like this, you must have a very clear path for your loyal (for now) clients to let you know what is wrong and not shift them off to automation.  Also, I don't need a stock reply of how shocked you are or whatever - give me real resources to help you fix your product so we can both be happy.  UPDATE: Still no update that I am aware of for all the problems listed UNLESS you notice they are hawking the 2015 version. If this is my update path, it is really depressing. I so wish there was a real alternative to this software.  UPDATE 9/29/2014: So after wrestling with this for this long, I have given up. It took some time, but I converted to GnuCash. Google it. There are very few things it cannot do that Quicken does but the absolute clincher is that if you use the MySQL version, you have access to YOUR DATA. I know Intuit does not care that they lost a customer but I have been using the program since about 1990. If they have have screwed up their program and let their customer service get so incredibly poor that a customer that has been using the product for 24 years gives up, it should tell you not only where this product is headed, but where it is.  Intuit, if you want to talk to me, you can call ME. I will supply you with my telephone number if you like. Just don't bother with your hollow boiler-plate responses here."
1,I have used 360 for several years and have not any problems since I first installed it. Great program for anyone
1,Just as described.
1,"The Avast free anti-virus is easy to install and work with, even for users who are not experienced.  I particularly appreciate the regular updates.  Liked it well enough to upgrade to pro."
1,Awesome!
1,my computer had a virus and I didn't want to pay for Microsoft Office so I downloaded this for free and it works great.
1,The price was good . It was easy to download the program and to start using it.i will recomand to my friends to buy the program.
1,Excellent Internet Security software -- a must have for any active computer users!
0,"We were doing a very simple short form until we received two 1099-C form from our bank, one in my name, and one in my wife's name. Each were for the difference between what we owed the bank, and what they managed to drive the property value down to. Because this was put on two forms instead of one joint one, Turbo Tax doubled the amount of forgiveness resulting in another $1700 owed the State of California.<br /><br /> It told me about insolvency, but did not supply the necessary form. I ended up paying H&R Block $200 to fix the mess and refile. That saved me $2500. So much for their maximum refund guarantee."
1,"Awesome thing to have!!!! Its a lot better to use compared to the rexeo game editor I was using.<br />Sony MS never crashes or frezzez like Roxie so thumbs up Sony!!! If your looking for a grate bang for your buck get this because it come with a buffet of video and adio effects to keep you videos fresh and cool. I made my intro using this, it was a little weird switching over but once I played around for a few minutes, everything was good. My intro can be seen at YouTube Ninjabarexp... I'm the one with the mustache."
1,I have used Turbo Tax Home & Business for years.  It has easy to follow instructions that guide you safely through the program and make completing your taxes very easy.  I would highly recommend Turbo Tax to anyone interested doing their own taxes.
1,"I really enjoy avast! antivirus.  I initially heard about avast! from a friend.  Since it's free I didn't think to much about it, but it was better than having to pay for a full service.  Once downloaded I quickly grew to enjoy the free software.  It's warns you of inappropriate websites and any sites that might have malware attached to it.  Quick scans generally get the job done, however full scans can be quite lengthy, but that goes without say.  Overall I'm very satisfied with the software.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for free antivirus software."
1,"A steep learning curve, but this is really good stuff.  I'm an amateur, but will definitely get some help with outdoor photography with this program."
1,Quicken Home & Business 2015 is very comprehensive but somewhat cumbersome to use.
0,These folks could fix this garbageware. Why do people buy it after reading of the pain they will endure?<br /><br />It doesn't work for rental property.
1,Avast is the only security I use on all my machines.
0,"I don't usually leave reviews, especially negative ones, but I'm taking the time today to write this one.  As a part time developer and full time software consultant, I have to tell you I can't believe this version made it through the QA process.  It's not only buggy, it is extremely SLOW and stops responding altogether for several seconds between clicks which creates an extremely frustrating user experience.  I have a fast PC and this thing runs like a dog.  This is a huge drop in performance since the last release.<br /><br />I've been a Quicken user since 1996 and I love the calendar feature.  I use it for budgeting by setting up placeholders for certain bills.  I can look several months out and get a good idea of what our finances will look like.  I often click forward a year or so and then back.  With this version if I try to do that it hangs after clicking through a few months.  Sometimes as long as a minute, before it starts to respond again.  It is with great disappointment that I will be going through the pain of uninstalling and moving back to a previous, more stable version of Quicken.<br /><br />I've spent a few hours already, looking for an alternative, but I can't find anything with a similar calendar function that allows me to manage my budget the way I do in Quicken.  I'd switch in a heartbeat at this point if I could find a good solution.  After over 15 years as a Quicken user I feel like this is a slap in the face.  I can't believe this version made it out the door.  Maybe it's time for a rewrite.  What really sucks is there is no real gain in functionality over a previous release, even a couple of years back.  I'm disappointed that I wasted the time and money to upgrade.<br /><br />My advise to current users, don't upgrade.  For new users, Quicken is still the best solution I have found but try to get an older version."
1,I got a virus using another free antivirus program.  Then switched to AVAST been happy ever since.  I like the ability to do a root kit scan before the operating system loads.
1,"Seems to work fine.  I don't like that they corporately make sure they stay in business since technically we don't need tax software from private companies when the government of the people, by the people, and for the people can do it themselves - but then there's obamacare and we know how dorked up that is.  Anyway what I really want is a tax code so small and easily understandable so fire the feds and let's get a better tax code written up that a moron can understand instead of dork up comments like we have to pass it to see what's in it."
0,I bought the ONLINE version of this program.  You can use it anywhere you have internet access.  There's nothing to install.  Mine is a lifetime deluxe version for up to 3 children.  It was a special offer through Plum District.<br /><br />I am a computer instructor and my child is heading into first grade.  She says she doesn't like to read.  This disappoints me.  I LOVE reading and I think she'll feel differently as it starts to come more easily to her.  I got this in the hopes it would add to her enjoyment and increase her success.  I've only played with it for 10 minutes but my thoughts are that Reader Rabbit is more fun and less $.  The only difference is those programs are installed and not something for anywhere/anytime online.<br /><br />They have a free trail so I'd say to use that and try it first.
0,I could not install it did not find my OS. about the time I was ready to give up I tried installing using CMD it worked.
0,"I have been using Turbo Tax since the 90's.  I am very disappointed that Turbo Tax has become a GREEDY MERCHANT.  I always purchased TurboTax Deluxe because that version included Schedule C and I am homeowner.  This year since the interest on my home is not enough for itemization I made the decision to use Turbo Tax online (which I discovered wasn't that much of a savings in cost).  Although, I was informed that since I did not purchase the software this year I was not eligible for the refund \\""quite understanding\\"" I am still very disappointed with the new Deluxe Version of TurboTax because I convinced many of my friends to purchase it, not knowing it had changed.      I hate I did not read the reviews prior to completing my taxes with TurbTax online."
1,"As always, Quicken works as expected at the top of the line.  The interface and activities provide excellent support and documentation. Great accounting and finance tools. Could not live without it."
0,"I have used Quicken for years, ever since Microsoft Money dropped out of the game. It falls into the &#34;what else is there?&#34; category. I find is useful to keep track of the many different accounts I deal with, but find a number of annoying bugs that never seem to get fixed. None is more than annoying, but they reflect badly on the quality control for the product. For example, in the latest release, Quicken complains for every check that clears that the number has been used before. Then it displays a transaction without any check number and invites me to accept the check with a duplicate number. Annoying, as I said, but certainly not a major problem.<br /><br />When it comes to keeping track of how the money is spent, Quicken is marvelous. I download transactions from various banks and investment accounts daily (OK, I'm a bit compulsive) and reconcile everything before closing the program. I have uncovered several erroneous credit card transactions before the credit card company is aware of the problem. Very nice.<br /><br />At tax time, I use Quicken to prepare information for the accountant. I find that the tax export feature of the program is not reliable enough for me to use it without checking everything.<br /><br />The reports produced by Quicken are rudimentary. The information is there, but the format and options are limited. For example, every year I print out a report of charitable contributions. Some of the donations are regular monthly deductions charged to a credit card. I can get the report to show all the donations, or just the total, but there is no option to show subtotals for each organization. Exporting the report to an Excel spreadsheet is a start, but you then have to do work to create a report showing the totals. This is an example of the &#34;good enough&#34; philosophy Intuit seems to espouse. I guess it suffices.<br /><br />If you want to take control of your financial life, I recommend Quicken. However, be prepared to put in some work, and to deal with the annoying bugs.<br /><br />I give it three stars. I wish it were better.and to deal with the annoying bugs.<br /><br />I give it three stars. I wish it were better."
0,"When I scan the antivirus, either it mentions that everything is fine, when if I check right after with spybot it said I have some problems, or iit tells me it can not scan some files, but then it tells me to chose options to apply, but when I look for them so that I can chose them, I do not find them anywhere,"
0,"My software problem was the Amazon downloader. Had to uninstal and reload, thanks to Amazon tech. However, could not load my Turbo Tax PDF from 2013 because TaxAct site was down for maintenance?  So far able to start my return, waiting for more tax information.  This has to be better than Turbo Tax that snookered all their customers. I'll update later this month.  Next challenge may be brokerage account loading."
1,It is GREAT!
0,"when I used Typing instructor for kids it glitched 5 times, it costs 12.99 and its a complete waste of your money and time I HATED IT!!!"
1,why don't you have avast free all year long instead of every 30 days renew it? it would be wonderful
0,"I am a long-time user of HR Block At Home (previously TaxCut) software. Bottom line, I was unable to complete my taxes with it this year and had to switch to TurboTax.<br /><br />The problem came about because I had converted a former residence to a rental.  At Home's instructions left much to be desired and even after I figured out a key entry where I had been led astray (Thanks TurboTax and IRS publication 936), I could NEVER get the repair expenses to allocate correctly. Mortgage and Tax expenses were okay, but not repair. TurboTax correctly instructed me how to enter the days of use and how to assign expenses to the period as a home and to the period as a rental.<br /><br />Also, while both programs were able to import information about ESPP transactions, TurboTax was better about establishing the correct basis.<br /><br />Turbotax did have at least one bug, where I had to delete an entry and start over, but at least I finished and feel confident that my taxes were prepared correctly."
1,H&R imported my TurboTax files from last year and I was done in no time.
1,"No issues downloading or installing on Vista.  Worked like a charm, just like prior years."
1,"I was sceptical, about a free antivirus product. How good could it really be ?<br />Well, I was shocked, it is better than the high priced one's you pay for. I know, I have tried the top 3 & had nothing but problems. Not easy fix issues either & forget CS Help, that is not going to happen. Even though, they say it's included.<br /><br />If you want a product to try for free, grab this while you can. After you see the ease & overall protection, you get, then you will want to buy the Deluxe Program.<br /><br />I do not like to waste money, who can afford to these day's, so save yourself, some money. Get something, that works, try it free, cost is much lower than the top 3. I assure you, you will be very pleased."
0,All this did was distort the sound. Worth every penny I paid for it. I wouldn't recommend this product on amazon.
1,I had been using an accountant for years.  Unfortunately he passed away last year and my tax needs had turned to fairly basic stuff.  I was pleased that this program was clear and precise.
1,"Normally I'm against buying software anyway but the box with CD, but have bought this from Amazon for the last two years now and have to say it was painless. I saved money and it installed without a hitch. I'm happy and will do it again next year."
0,"I can't even sign in!!!  The username box won't accept a curser, so I can't type in it.  I want a REFUND for this useless piece of s***!!!"
1,"I've used other stupid antivirus and ended up getting all kinds of viruses.  so far Avast! has been the best.  And the others (I won't name names) won't let us uninstall it!  It will, but its very difficult, I had to have my friend do it for me."
1,Easy transfer. No Glitches. Been using for 10+ yrs. Keeps us on budget so we know where we are in real time. I'd be lost without it.
0,"Needed to map a trip, so tried to download this product. After about 5-6 hrs. it completed, but I was back to it wanting me to install it again. I checked to see if it had been installed. It had not, tried it again, no go. I just purchased the discs also from Delorme. Needless to say, something that could have been simple, was impossible. I still don't have the downloaded version. Oh, forgot, tried downloading the download app. Would not load, did not do anything."
0,"Intuit trying to make amends - too little, too late?  This from an article just posted from a well known on-line publication in the USA today (figure it out folks, it ain't rocket science).<br /><br />&#34;TurboTax announced tweaks Thursday to undo changes to the software, a response to a massive outcry from users complaining about a crippling of the product unless a 50% price hike is paid,<br /><br />Starting in early February, buyers of the “Deluxe” version of TurboTax’ tax-preparation software will be upgraded to the “Premier” or “Home and Business” version of the software. This upgrade will return the functionality that was stripped out of the mid-priced version this year. The upgrade will be provided to users for free, a giant victory for the users of the desktop software.&#34;"
0,Since 'upgrade' I learned it is pretty much exactly the same but less stable and forces you to &#34;link&#34; in to Quicken to use the auto update features. Where is MS money or another company to keep them on their toes? Why is there no competition anymore in this area?
1,Very comprehensive easy to use wizard for making wills.  Just print it out and take it to the bank to be notarized.
0,"This version was highly confusing and very difficult to file because it kept finding a problem that wasn't a problem. So many complaints about this problem too.  Every time I went through the software trying to fix the issue, the amount I owed changed drastically.  So I don't know if my final tax filing was correct or not.  I have had problems with the same bundle for 3 years in a row and I'm done. I think it will be worth it to pay an extra $100 to a qualified tax preparer."
0,It works fine but I was supposed to get the state filing free but it charged me!
1,I like it very much. It does the job it was made to do. I use it almost every day.
0,"I purchase the upgrade every year. For the second time in about 5 years, printing envelopes is impossible. There are no issues with my printer setup as invoices, checks and even complete address listing print with no problem. But I use the program to print some of my envelopes that need an address instead of using the window type. The program looks and sounds like it will print the addresses, but all that happens is a blank envelope coming out of the printer!!!! What were you thinking??? We use this program for the ability to manage small businesses. I know I could care less about having the ability to access it from a cloud, hot air balloon, sailboat or any other place. I use it in the privacy of my home office and I expect it to work. Who in their right mind is going to put their personal monetary affairs on someone else's server?<br />I don't want to hear about your \\""work-around of using MS word to print my envelopes...Not an option. Get the damn program fixed and alert us when you have it fixed! Should be easy enough! You ruined the same feature about 5 years back and fixed it after about 2 years. Remember? You would not even admit you screwed it up. Those of us who really use the program know when you screw up.....because it fails to work when we need it!!!!"
0,"Hello I already bought  today this product, but when i tray to install always have problems. First, It is Say the trial version expired. Second, Show me a proxy problem, but I run the fixing problem, but it is not work. I cannot activited my subscription. The server not connected error (-6). I Have been Norton from 2008, but now I don't now what happend. Please help. Thanks"
1,for antivirus that is free works great
1,"Perfect download.....since I own the product, I can download to both computers. A great way to keep track of everything for tax accountant. Love it."
1,"As a computer guy, I know that internet security programs are always overrated simply because Windows is an electromagnet for viruses.  That being said, Norton 360 is definately one of the best ones out there.  Once I got it installed I noticed that there was no significant drop in my memory usage, boot-up time, or CPU usage.  Some traditional security programs have inefficient download filters which scan every packet that comes through the browser.  The side effect is slower download speeds.  Kaspersky is notorious for this.  Once I installed Norton, I noticed an immediate increase in my download speed.  So far so good.<br /><br />It has managed to catch a virus and delete it without a hitch.  Of course, one virus doesn't define a security program unless it's Kaspersky, which caught a total of 0 viruses for the year I've had it.<br /><br />The PC tune-up works better than expected.  After reinstalling Windows, within one week, I started getting the blue screen of death because Windows decided to misconfigure an update and it screwed-up my enture system.  Funny, the biggest performance problems I have with my computer come from software made from Microsoft.  I ran the PC tune-up program in Norton.  Suddenly, my computer works again and the Windows updates start working too.  Cool!  For those of you thinking of getting a good all around security program, this one is the best."
0,Doesn't work. I installed it and then went on vacation with it on my laptop. It quit working and hasn't worked since. This review is making me write 20+ words. Hate hate hate hate
1,I use this every day. Been using this since Quicken '02. So if you like to manage money and want to see where your money is going. A nice chart will let you see all that plus more.
0,So far I don't care for it.  I have been unable to download my bank information without doing so from the bank website.
0,I have had to re-submit my taxes 6 times!! Turbo Tax customer support was useless!! I had to call the IRS just for a simple code that Turbo Tax SHOULD HAVE HAD IN THERE DATABASE!!! We're are VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT!!
0,Doesn't work with new Mac iOS and now my old files are gone and I have to pay another $280 ... what a rip off.
1,Product works fabulously. Download was easy.<br />I recommend this product to the average user as well as students. It has everything you'll need.
1,Great program!  Definitely a 'steal' of a deal for the price!  Walmart does NOT always have the cheapest prices on products!
1,"The software is very useful for keeping your home finances. Be aware that there is a learning curve involved. I've used other financial software and found that it took a bit to figure out how to use this software. In fact, I'm still learning it, but it is very powerful and I really appreciate how it shows where the money goes."
1,"I don't have a lot of money, so I bought and downloaded this product. After studying for about a month, I felt I had made real progress. Then, I tried the demo version of Rosetta Stone. After trying Rosetta Stone which is endorsed by the department of state, all I could think is that there must be a lot of US diplomats walking around foreign countries that can't speak the language. If you want to learn a language, try the innovative language series and forget Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />There is another review for this product that said that the product was incomplete and didn't work for their computer. That won't happen to you. There is a plus (+) icon at the top left side of the screen that you have to click on to get the lesson menu. I am surprised that a person would have the ability to purchase something on the internet and not figure out that they had to click on the (+) icon to make the lesson menu appear. Everyone knows that after the menu comes up, the (+) will turn into a (-) and if they click on the (-) then the lesson menu will disappear.<br /><br />A prospective purchase should also note, that as of the date of writing this review, there are only two negative reviews for this Chinese language series. Both of the negative reviews are negative because the people who bought the product found out later that the same information that's in the product they paid for is free on the company's web site. It is just poor taste to give a product a bad review because you found it cheaper somewhere else."
1,The lightest and best of the bunch.Install it and it takes care of the rest.In the past 4 to 5 years Norton has become the #1 solution in the Antivirus industry.
1,"Easy to use and straight forward. I was able to finish tax filing without a hiccup. E-filing part is not as easy as Turbotax. The state e-filing fee, $19.95, seems to be sneaky. It forces you to pay at the last step. It should be posted upfront."
1,"Quick, easy download.  Can download transactions from your bank.  Good basic product when you don't need all the &#34;bells and whistles&#34;."
0,"I am really upset with Quicken. I have owned Quicken software for a long time. My current version is Quicken Deluxe 2012, which I bought new less than a year ago. I was trying to reinstall it on a new computer, but the setup program failed to work. When I called Quicken for help with their defective disk, I was told that they support only the 2013 version and if I wanted help, I'd have to upgrade or pay them. Quicken makes a lot of money on this program, especially when they come out with a new version practically every year. Yet they refuse to support even the last incarnation of their product. In view of their arrogant customer service policies, I imagine a lot of users are seriously considering finding an alternative. What have we done for them lately? What have they done for us?"
1,I use avast on all computers me or my family own and install and recommend for friends to use. love it
1,"So I got this software and now I can change the white balance and a whole host of other things in my photos.<br /><br />This is a poor man's Lightroom, which is cool because I am a poor man."
1,"Very happy. We are using this on 3 computers, between my father and my wife and I.  Only problem I've had is that my computer used to have a 1 month free sample of Norton, which had expired.  This key worked for a day, until a patch update, but my father had installed his first, and Norton blocked me due to location being different and having an expired key already saved somewhere on my machine.  This was overcome by using my father's Norton ID and re-entering that on my machine.  Haven't needed to do that for my wife's yet.  Otherwise, it's been working fine.  Pleasantly surprised that it does not slow my computer down much."
0,"I used TaxCut about fifteen years.  Several times, I tried to switch to TurboTax, but each time I found errors (bugs), and went back to TaxCut, which always seemed to calculate my taxes correctly.  Unfortunately, the quality seems to have deteriorated since H&R Block took over.    H&R Block At Home Deluxe 2010 State and Local Income Tax Payment Worksheet has a bug: Estimated Tax Entries in Table 1 can be accompanied by \\""X if for Fourth Quarter 2009\\"", but putting an X in the box does nothing to the calculation of the deductible state and local taxes in this worksheet. It should. The calculation of Line 6 should be the sum of the entries in Table 5 minus the Table 1 entries with an X, except that Line 6 should not be less than zero. However, this software program does not subtract the Table 1 entries in its calculation of Line 6; that results in double counting of those amounts with the X. If you don't correct the results of this table, you may have too large a state tax deduction carried over to Schedule A.     I notified customer support.  A lady called on the phone and listened politely.  Checked with someone else.  Called back.  Net result: Maybe it is not quite right, but there was no guarantee they would fix the bug.  I have not tried another tax software package this year, so I cannot say the others are better.  Just watch out!"
0,Just like the other reviewers here. Will not stay running. Crashes the moment you put in the activation code. Trying to get a refund.
1,Thanks
1,"I simply can not believe the performance improvement I experienced immediately after installing Norton 360. Everyting is far quicker; browsing, email and program launch.<br /><br />I'm still learning my way around, but I'm excited about the password vault feature as well.<br /><br />I wish I had installed this months ago, instead of waiting for my past security software subscription to expire!"
1,Quickbooks online not only offers great features like simpke invoicing and estimates it also offers  the convenience of being able to use it on the go wherever you go if there is Internet access. ..you can access all your business needs with no software to download or purchase. Its secure and reliable and is everything I need for my business.
0,"We have been used Quickbooks since the Pro version came out a long time ago. We were satisfied with the product up through the 2011 version. We were forced to upgrade to the 2014 version because of our use of assisted payroll. We have found QB 2014 to be the buggiest version yet to be released by intuit, particularly multiuser with Windows 8. We have lost countless hours with tech support along with approximately 40 hours of accounting work because of a glitch in the payroll module. Last weeks update to R5 is now preventing my computer from opening any of our QB files and it is back to tech support once again.and prompting me to my first ever product review. I understand that QB has a 90 % market share but I need a product that does not require so much tech support to keep it working."
1,Helped my computer so much !
1,"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 [Download] from Amazon was so simply to purchase and download. Not only was this so easy but it was also the cheapest options I found from a reputable website.<br /><br />As far as Lightroom, the program is a must have for anyone who considers themselves a photo enthusiast. Produces amazing photos and not very complicated. I have received so many compliment after I began using Lightroom to edit my photos. Worth every penny!"
1,The first thing this did was wipe off my old ssytem as being a problem<br />I have had no problems with anything sense downloading this product<br />it works fanasticly<br />My friend said this was th eone to get and he is always right
1,It's free and reliable and save me a lot of worry & I'm out of ideas to write down for now
0,"I really have to lower my review.  This program is nothing but frustrating.  Unless your a photographic professional, don't buy it.  All I wanted to do tonight is merge two picture together side by side.  As expected, it is not intuitive, assuming the program can even do it.  The only help is in the community forums which refer to items that are not even available on my menus.  This will be my last version of this software as it is overly complicated and more frustrating than useful.    This is my third version of PE.  While the program itself is probably more than I need and overly complex it appears to be the only software out there that currently meets my needs.  I would guess that I will never use over 80% of the features in this software which may make my review irrelevant, but I have yet to find any software between amateur an professional that meets my needs.  Overall the software is extremley user UNfriendly and requires a time committment to learning it.  My biggest beef is the online backup which I pay for, but unsure what I am getting.  Seems very primitave and there is absolutely no customer support for the online backup support.  This is an OK program since there is no comparative competitor, but if there were would probably switch."
0,"didn't work for me . after calling their support # twice , finally found out how to request a refund (still waiting for a reply).after waiting several hours for program to run , got a message &#34;sorry , we can't work here&#34;. something about exposing a flaw in their program ,&#34;no changes made to your machine&#34;--? think i've been ripped off. oh well , it's only money...."
1,I switched to QuickBooks Online Plus when my construction business took off. I allows me to work at several job sites in one day. I don't need to remember what needs inputing when I get to the office or home. I just get it done right on the spot. If I'm not sure of how to track something my account can look it over in real time. I ofter need to pull a report for a customer on site. Never a problem<br />As a very busy small business owner I would recommend QuickBooks Online Plus to anyone.
1,"I like this product, works great."
1,Garmin in 2015 reduced from 4 updates a year to 3.
0,This product is a waste of time and money if you use Windows 8.  It only saves files in a PDF format of which the program only recognizes Adobe reader to open scanned files.
0,"Once again I am very impressed with Both AVG Internet Security and PC-Tuneup.  I made the mistake of ordering the download version from Amazon.  Turns out Amazon gives you the wrong PC-Tuneup download altogether and a product key that doesn't work.  After nearly 30 minutes on hold with AVG the call went dead. After an additional 53 minutes on hold I finally got some help and resolved the problems. I don't think I'll be ordering download versions from Amazon again.  By the way I give both products 5 Stars, but give Amazon 1 on this purchase"
1,"Doing your taxes is a task that no one looks forward to.  TurboTax puts a little enjoyment back into the process by making it so easy to accomplish completing the forms and filing electronically.  The ad campaigns that some tax preparation companies are running are bogus.  Unless your taxes are significantly complicated, TurboTax won't miss a thing.  This is a great product that gets better each year."
1,Much improved over office 2003 that I was using
0,"I have used Quicken Deluxe for years.  I sync two accounts with Bank of America and one with American Express.  Every time it is time to update to the latest version of Quicken I hesitate.  Should I stay with the version I have or update?  My present version was working with  BofA and Amex and did everything I needed.  Too many times in the past I had problems syncing my online accounts after a Quicken update.  This time I decided to updated to Quicken 2013  because of the new mobile apps availability.  So I downloaded and installed Quicken Deluxe 2013 and the mobile apps on my iPhone and iPad.  Things went reasonably well.  There were some problems with the mobile apps showing all of the updated bank transactions in a timely manner -- they could be different several hours or a day from the online bank information -- but I could live with that.  Everything went like this for about one week.  Then, I was on my PC and tried to update my BofA and Amex accounts.  Amex updated fine, both BofA accounts came back with \\""Quicken is unable to update your account.....  Please try again.  [CC 505]\\""  After four days of trying again, still nothing!<br /><br />I have seen this problem too many times before after updating Quicken.  I no longer care if it is a Quicken problem or a Bank of America problem -- it is Quicken's problem to resolve.  I can easily access my BofA and Amex accounts on line with out any problems -- Quicken can not.<br /><br />The next time I ask myself should I pay to update to the latest version of Quicken the answer will be no."
1,"excellent for personal finances. would like a little bit more on the business side, but does the job well.  recommended."
0,"I never received an activation code. I emailed Amazon and Norton and got no satisfaction.  Also, during the thirty days it worked without the code, it slowed my computer so much that I deactivated it completely each time I started my computer."
1,Awesome
1,"I love my new Mac, but sometimes you really just need the Office programs, downloading this has helped me do work from home and prep for grad school."
0,So far I am very disappointed in this software.  I purchased it in order to convert my family DVD videos to a digital format so that I can edit and store these videos on my computer.  I have not been able to convert 1 DVD.  I continually receive messages that tell me the content is invalid despite the fact that there is no copyright issues since they are my personal DVD's.  I could kick  myself for spending the $50 to download the software and I am hoping that someone sees this and offers some easy fix or I might just go to Amazon customer service for help.  I will also post as many negative reviews as I can across the net.  These companies should not be permitted to misrepresent their products.
0,Warning - This downloaded software does not work.  DO NOT BUY! I get an error message and it will not install.  Amazon should be ashamed for selling a totally worthless product.
1,I switched from Microsoft Security Essentials to avast about 6 months ago. It has detected several threats since then. MSE never detected any. It is fast and efficient and discreet. And you cant beet the price!
0,"It was supposed to provide the upgrade to the Premium edition automatically. But when time came for the update, the program claimed it couldn't connect to the internet (Completely false).  I had to google for an answer to this problem. An obscure phone number in an error message was the answer. But I still had to wait 30 minutes for a response from the call center to provide me with a certification number to plug into a form to enable the feature.<br /><br />THEN when it was time to download the state tax software, the same problem recurred.  Another 30 minute call to customer support followed by another 20 minutes while the support rep tried to figure out what to do.<br /><br />Never again."
1,"I've been using TurboTax for at least 3-4 years now and I have loved it every year. It is very easy to use, and makes Taxes a breeze for those of us that don't really know the details. Have had TurboTax assist me with some questions live while I was doing my taxes and they were very helpful. Overall Amazing Product!"
1,"I keep trying others, but this simply works without huge overhead or quirks.  The price for this is very reasonable."
0,They dropped schedule d and c without really telling us. After using turbotax for the past 10 years very disappointed in their greed.
0,"Update 1/13/15: BEWARE! TurboTax will NOT work with my Apple iMac computer because I use version 10.6.8 - TT now requires version 10.7.5, so I'd have to update my entire operating system just to use TT Premier. What a joke!    I'm sure glad I read the reviews that Deluxe now excludes Schedule D starting with this tax year. I changed my order to Premier after using Deluxe for over a decade. I did see that big box store Costco is selling Deluxe for $40 and Premier for $55 (plus tax) for the next few weeks. One huge irritant for me with TurboTax over the years - while it can calculate quarterly estimated taxes, it does not allow me to override their figures if I want to pay a different amount on Form 1-ES. I always end up having to download Form 1-ES from the IRS site."
1,Been using it for years and it has never let me down !
1,An excellent tool; I transferred XP to Win 8 without any problems. Very easy to use even for the novice.
0,"Avast works well at stopping viruses, adware, and malicious webpages. It also has a free version, which is a great thing.<br /><br />On the other hand the free version used to just offer less than the paid version. Now the free version will spam me usually once per day in the lower right corner of my screen. Usually it is just trying to get me to buy their products. I understand that a free version might do this, but it didn't use to and it is disappointing that Avast has sunk so low as to do this."
1,Excellent!
1,"I'm a Mac guy, I'll say that right up front.  I work on Windows all day long (I am an I.T. consultant for over a dozen small-med size businesses), so I've always used Mac at home because I don't want to deal with the crap in my house that I deal with all day long with customers.  But customers have been asking me for input on Windows 10 for their businesses, so I purchased a copy and loaded it unto my Bootcamp drive on my (2014) MacBook Pro.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm impressed.  They have a few bugs to work out, and I've noticed that some websites really fail pretty hard in the new Edge browser, but 95% of my experience thus far has been positive. It looks and feels great.  It's easy to use and understand.  It makes sense.  I'm really pretty impressed with MS on this version of Windows.  Looking forward to some updates to fix the bugs, but other than that...I'm pretty excited about it."
1,"My 8 year old had a great time playing this, and the instant download was a great bonus! His only complaint is that he wanted more levels after he completed the game."
1,Best Antivirus in my opinion.  Will buy again next year from Amazon.
0,"I was able to start software and enter information, but was unable to e-file.  Ran a security check on the program and files were missing from the download. Ended up calling H&R Block's technicl support hotline and they re-sent me the entire software package. New software package worked perfect."
0,"I used Norton for several years.  But trying to GET  OUT of Norton is impossible.  They won't even give me a partial refund for an auto renewal that I didn't set up!  I've switched from PC to Mac and don't need Norton at all any more, but I'm STILL paying for it!!"
0,Do not believe it was as helpful as in years past... I've used turbo tax for 10 years
1,I've been using Quicken for years and I can't think of another application that I would prefer to use.
1,I think its way better than any other anti-virus program I have ever known. I will always stick with it.
1,This product was easy to buy and easy to install.  Amazon had the lowest price for genuine microsoft products online.
1,Really like the Guide me feature as it was very helpful getting set up.
1,Malwarebytes is awesome and very good at it's job. Worth buying a lifetime premium subscription.
1,It has all the advantages of Microsoft and has the templates as well. It does perform well and even let's you encrypt your files and folders. The only reason I uninstalled it was because I do have a Microsoft account and don't need this as an extra. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a free system compatible to MS.
0,"Microsoft office works well, but I don't like the fact that you must subscribe to it every year.  If you don't everything may still work but you won't get any upgrades.  I don't plan to renew if this is the case."
1,"Very easy to use.  I alternate between H&R Block and Turbotax to prepare my tax returns.  This year, H&R Block was more reasonably priced so I went with them.  I e-filed my federal tax returns this year using this software.  California residents beware!  Unlike the feds, State of California charges $19.95 for e-filing.  It is still cheaper to mail in or even FedEx your state tax returns."
1,I am very pleased with the avast! Free Antivirus that I have on my computer.  It is always up-to-date and alerts me if there is anything that needs my attention.  I recommend this service if anyone asks me what antivirus system I use.
1,great for checking return and maximizing CPA done return
0,"The compatibility between Microsoft Word and WordPerfect seems to be exactly as advertised. All the other positive reviews of WordPerect itself are right on. I only wish the same were true of the advertised compatibility between the spreadsheet part of WordPerfect Office (QuattroPro) and Microsoft Excel.<br /><br />Whether or not QuattroPro will open a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet without crashing seems to be a completely random event. Even  more worrisome is that after the crash (stops responding), the Excel spreadsheet is corrupted, although it sometimes is saved as a .tmp file.<br /><br />Corel tech support--only free for the first 30-days to deal with installation problems, is at the typical level of large software companies now--suggesting first some boilerplate advice, then concluding the problem must lie elsewhere. As a programmer since my first IBM 8088 in 1982, I've learned that when a PC works flawlessly before new software is installed and then develops a problem, it probably is not just a coincidence.<br /><br />My best recommendation: Use WordPerfect as a word processor but do not get rid of Microsoft Excel."
0,"I'm in my '30s and I grew up playing the old DOS Carmen games and watching Where In The World game show on PBS. But, that time is gone. This is Carmen for a new generation..better graphics and a different type of interaction entirely. Is it as fun? I really have to say it's not because the challenge of solving x number of cases and memorizing what clues mean isn't there. If your around my age, don't buy this game to show kids what the older games were like. Go on YouTube instead. But, if you want to introduce Carmen to a new generation in a fun, exciting and different way..go ahead and buy it. Just disable your security software during download. I think they ought to release a USA version of this game and have multiple cases for it, like the classic USA versions."
1,"I used to use turbo tax, and it worked well for me. I purchased H&R when it was on sale, and I am happily surprised that H&R Block worked as well as Turbo Tax, and saved me tons of time. I recommend Home Deluxe if you trade stocks, bonds, or have mortgage..."
1,"I've never used anything else so I have no comparison.  The first time I used it, it was a little bit confusing but over the years I've adapted.  It's definitely better than the old fashioned way of filling out the forms and mailing them in.  E-file is the way to go!!"
1,I love it easy to down load
0,"i got a new project, and have to export the file to mp4. my pr cs3 doesn't handle mp4 very well, so need to upgrade the program. i thought about getting the pr cs5, but too pricey, so i jumped to the cheaper version, pre 9.<br /><br />if i could give 0 star, i would do it, because the pre 9 just can't play the quicktime.<br /><br />i downloaded it from amazon w/o any problem, very fast and smooth (thanks amazon). then installed it, and started to work on the project. man...it's a nightmare!!! all i need to do is to import the quicktime, then i could start editing. but the pre 9 just kept giving me blank white screen (i could still hear the audio). i closed the pre9, re-opened it, then restarted my computer...tried everything, still gave me blank screen. i tried to re-install the latest quicktime as the \\""help\\"" suggested...work for the first 10 sec, and then gave me blank screen again...after a lot of re-starting, i decided to visit the adobe forum...found a so-call solution, and replaced the \\""VideoRenderer.dll\\"" (a codec). i had an high hope on it, but the disappointment ruled the situation...still getting blank screen at the end. after 4 hrs trying, i gave up!<br /><br />my computer has a i5 cpu, 6 GB RAM, 1GB video card, and more than 300GB free space...not super fast, but it should handle the pre9, so hardware isn't a problem in this my case.<br /><br />This is the WORST Premiere I have ever used in my life. it may handle other format such as avi, mpeg...but not mov! I want my money!!!"
1,"Best antivirus software out there and best of all, it's free!"
1,smooth and simple download and installation on a windows 7 64 bit pc.  had it up and running within 2 minutes of clicking the buy now button.
1,I bought the Lifetime Garmin updates for my husband and son.  This product did not come with the ones we originally bought so I was very happy to see it available.  The price was right and they appreciate the updates.
0,Software would not download updates.  I had to purchase a SECOND version of the same software that included the updates. Very frustrating. Not sure I'll ever use TT again.
0,"I've been using Quicken 2008 and decided to buy and download Quicken 2010 this afternoon. After installing I was very disappointed to find that the free online version actually was better suited for my needs than the purchased copy. The online version has more options with my bank (it can pull loan infomation while the Deluxe edition cannot) and I don't use many of the other features that warrant the cost of this one.    I decided that I would ask for the refund that is advertised with the product:     \\""100% Satisfaction Guarantee  If you're not 100% satisfied, return your Quicken Deluxe 2010 personal finance software with your dated receipt within 60 days of purchase for a refund of the purchase price (return shipping and handling charges not included). \\""    I sat, waiting in queue for half an hour to get a support person on a live chat to request my refund. He told me that they will not honor the refund because I bought the download version and I would have to request it from Amazon. In my opinion, that \\""Satisfaction Guarantee\\"" needs to state that if you buy a download edition you have to go back to the retailer. There is no clarification of that before I click to buy and it's not as if I'm buying from a non-reputable source I trust that a purchase from Amazon will follow any requirements from the manufacturer. A quick look at the policy and Amazon has clearly stated that \\""Downloadable software products\\"" are not returnable. I hope that they will work with me on this more than Intuit, but, as it stands I'm stuck with software that I don't want and a \\""100% Satisfaction Guarantee\\"" that is not being honored.    I only give the application 2 stars because if your banks fully support the features that you need and you use more features than those which are available in the free online version then it may be worth the cost, just don't buy the download unless you have to have it right away!"
0,"[[ASIN:B005GI18EI Norton Antivirus 2012 - 1 User 3 PC]] !!!! DO NOT BUY !!! Your computer will not be fully protected and I made this mistake and then had to turn around & get the 360. It is not only a waste of funds but time too. I can be witnessing the Gospel of Christ instead of doint all this uninstall, install, activate, etc."
0,"If I could give this no stars, I would because it is essentially worthless. I used Quicken Essentials and Quicken 2007 for Mac without any problems. This version connects to accounts at its whim. I have had to delete and re-enter accounts to get them to work. For the past week, I can't access my primary accounts. And real help is nonexistent. Go to the &#34;live community' and Quicken support gives solutions that don't work, if it responds at all. Terrible product. Waste of money. Totally exasperated.  Update: After a flurry of responses from Quicken support to my problem (and that of many others apparently), things are back to normal--hopefully better. Still have qualms about this product (second time I've encountered connection problem in three weeks), but appreciate the timely fix."

1,"Very good product, easy to use and always gets the best results."
1,"It does what it says it's going to do & has helped keep my system running ok. It warns me when when a known virus has been detected in one of my downloads giving me the chance to delete it. It pretty much stays out of the way & is very unobtrusive. I've used it for at least 10 mostly consecutive years. Had one ugly run in with customer service a few years back & vowed never to use it again. Tried Kaspersky for only 5 minutes (ouch!!!): Knew it was bad news when it intruded on every action I took on my pc and virtually asked me for my skivvys size presumably so it could put the squeeze on the family jewels (?!). AND it's created by a good buddy of Vladimir Putin!!! YOWWW!!! QUICKLY back to Norton! Fortunately, with a bit of care, I've not had to deal with what I believe to be lousy (argumentative, stubborn, --- NO I will NOT allow them to take over my pc) customer service. For instance, I do NOT use Norton's automatic renewal or payment (or anybody else's automatic crap-shoot!). Read their reviews! It works pretty much as advertised & it's reasonably priced. Yeah, it's better than good but it ain't 5 star great!"
1,"I've been using Norton Internet Security for years now and until it lets me down I have no plans to switch...<br /><br />Pro's: 1. I have't had a virus or security issue in a long time.<br />  2. It's easy on system resources<br />  3. Norton Identity safe is a must have app.<br /><br />Con's 1. This version seems a little buggy. Nothing to serious. I'm sure they will work the bugs out over time.<br />  2. Seems to load slowly at start up compared to 2012 version.<br />  3. Changes your default search to &#34;Ask&#34;.  What the *&%$k is Symantec thinking? I paid for this product didn't I? They<br />  also put a link to facebook on the Identity safe toolbar that can't be removed... Again, I paid for this product didn't I?"
1,Our security for our laptop expired the next day so we ordered this web root it worked great and very easy to use great price also
1,Very intuitive software. Very helpful in visualizing a room before changes are made.
0,"Generously I'm giving Quicken Home and Business 2015 two stars.  I'm being forced to update due to Quicken's policy of terminating vital download functions to, presumably, artificially maintain a target revenue stream. Still I can deal with a 3 year product life cycle, but I expect a product to get better, not worse. 2012 was more reliable, even though they never fixed their split transaction, two-accounts reconciliation bug.    This is R3 version, and it's still patched together and acting like a beta build. I created a new loan account, downloaded the transactions, and Quicken refuses to show me a register to add, edit transactions. I have a couple of buggy floating buttons over my pie chart, and no access to a register.    A couple of the windows' scroll bars don't work right, the program hangs in odd places, menus sometimes need to be clicked twice to activate, takes a long time to due simple things, and all these observations only after a couple hours with it.  I shudder to think what I'll be up against when I try to reconcile investment accounts with 40 or so diversified stocks/bonds/funds.    The addition of the credit score is a nice feature, and what they've tried to do makes sense, they're just forcing us to be the beta testers.    Footnote: if you manage your husband/wife/business/kids's finances in a different file, you will need to create a completely different \\""Intuit ID\\"" for each file. I haven't gotten a completely satisfying answer why our downloading transaction from Bank A needs to have a \\""Intuit ID\\"" before I can download; I really don't want Quicken to have any of my data in its cloud to act as another data breach target headline in 2015. Like it or not, want their mobile options or not, want to use their website to aggregate your data or not, you can't get anywhere anymore without first ponying up your demographics to Quicken.    Looking forward for R4+ to get this stabilized."
1,I actually use this program to copy classes so I can watch them over and over. It seems like I miss alot the first time the class is offered so it is great to have this program. It would work well for college students to tape a lecture online.
1,I have been using PCMatic for about 3 months now and so far it is terrific. My 10 year old computer has the speed of a new one and I get regular maintenance with no effort.  This is a really good deal.
1,"I'm just beginning but out of the box this is recognizing my dictation, even though after 40 years of typing I compose better through the keyboard than on paper. System and application commands are very difficult to learn but I am making progress - nowhere near efficient enough yet for real work but at least it's not discouraging. I'm going in with five-stars because if you are on the fence about this it's worth it just for the dictation accuracy."
0,how to get blind using a brand new full hd notebook? Just by using word 2013. I can' t believe how worse it is than word 2007 and why simple things were made complicated. windows 8 is awful and office 2013 even worse.
0,"I have used and loved Quicken for years so when I saw some of the new features of Quicken Deluxe 2014 I downloaded it.  Immediately  after the download I begin getting &#34;Microsoft Windows has stopped working errors&#34; with an Appcrash.  I downloaded the patches etc. suggested by Quicken on the website and it would work until I restarted the laptop and then all the problems would begin again.  I finally took it off my laptop but somehow, it continued to cause Appcrash.  I have now had to completely rebuild my laptop to finally get rid of all of it."
0,"Quicken needs a full MAC version.  I've used the PC version for 20 years, but now use a MAC.<br /><br /> I've given up on it and gone to iBank Version 5."
1,I typically follow HowToGeek.com's recommendations and Avast! was their top pick. It's been fantastic. Easy to use and on the eyes.
1,"I saw enough negative reviews that I almost did not buy this version, but I was tired of having to boot a copy of windows every time I wanted to add a transaction, so decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I wanted to start fresh, so I did not import any old quicken files, but just started out importing my existing bank and credit card accounts online.<br /><br />The program has strong roots in Mint, but has several improvements with all the data on your computer.  One downside, it requires me to do a manual download of my Barclay Visa, which mint can handle directly.  All of my other accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts download with the \\""one-click\\"" button.<br /><br />The main feature I would like to see next is 12 month budgeting.<br /><br />I am glad that I did not heed the negative reviews, now I have a Mac friendly program that allows me to easily keep up with my transactions and spending levels."
1,Just as desc. Great tool and quick download. It saved me a lot of money. Thank you for such a great purchase.
1,"I've used Turbo Tax for 8 Years now. Using it yearly means repetitious data can be automatically downloaded from previous filings. I do both my taxes and my brother's to split the cost and this makes it much cheaper than H&R Block. The step-by-step features ensures that nothing is missed in determining your taxes and additional help is only a few clicks away. Also, Amazon usually offers the product at a cheaper price than the box stores and you can either have the physical product mailed to you or easily and quickly download it to your computer in minutes."
1,"Clean, intuitive, light and apparently effective according to testing.  Couldn't ask for much more in a free anti virus program."
1,Very good
0,This program did not even come close to my expectations. In which so I would like my money refunded.
1,It works great!!! So much better than the others!! Thank you!!
1,Great
0,"POS, Don't buy, I wrote a longer review, but the powers kicked me off. DONT BUY!"
0,"There is a big learning curve with this product and I can't even figure out how to use all of the features. There really should be some type of training that comes along with it because if most people are like me they only use 10% of the features because they can't figure the rest out.<br /><br />I really only use the payroll feature and so far I've had no issues. I wanted to avoid paying a CPA to calculate my payroll taxes, and this product does eliminate that need.<br /><br />I may or may not renew the subscription at the end of the term. If I can find a payroll product that is cheaper, then I'll probably switch because I'm not in love with QuickBooks. Also, if you call the Customer Service department for help with the product they just try to upsell you to something else or a charge you to answer your questions, they aren't Customer Service, they are sales people."
1,Turbo Tax is easy to use and asks questions to cover all topics. It explains all sections in great detail.
1,It's exactly what o expected! Dealing with the stress of traveling a lot its perfect use for on the go.
1,"I'm a graduate in IT with my Bachelor's degree. In all my years using PCs I've NEVER purchased AntiVirus. Well when I got a new HP it came with 2 year Norton protection. The program is very lite weight, protects from malware, and includes firewall protection. Going forward I'm now only using Norton for my computers.<br /><br />Only con:<br /><br />It's not free like AVG :-( You get what you pay for though. This is an all in 1 protection."

1,"There is so much available in Painter X3 that it is a great way to expand your artistic talents and skills.  Painter can amplify your image beyond your own expectations.  It can blow your mind with the results and make you very happy and satisfied!<br /><br />I started with Painter 4 and I am still amazed by how much Painter helps me!  I don't think that I've found the bottom of the tool chest yet.  It seems like there are endless tools, techniques, etc. to use!<br />Corel has updated and simplified their workspace layout too, making a complex software much easier to use.<br /><br />And, yes, I agree with another reviewer that it is much more stable. Works really well with Win 7 64bit Home version.<br /><br />Oh, I have to mention that their undos have been increased.  Finally, it is in the hundreds instead of only 32 undos.  My wish has been answered!  It is still found in edit/preference menu."
1,"WordPerfect is by far the best word processing package for professional writers, although it may take some getting used to for anyone moving from another package (front-runner Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and open-source LibreOffice are the only real competitors for general use these days).  It is especially popular in the legal community because of its power in handling all sorts of formatting chores requiring reference tracking (e.g., footnotes, endnotes, indexes), fill-in-the-blank templates, and accepting and producing just about any document format imaginable.  Not that the competitors aren't trying.<br /><br />The main problem Corel has in profiting from its holding is that it also takes many hours, perhaps days, for experienced WordPerfect users to upgrade from a previous version because for some inexplicable reason Corel hasn't completely figured out how to transfer old settings -- even for what clearly are unmodified features.  Some of the settings that aren't transferred are downright dangerous:  &#34;Prompt Before Auto Replacement&#34; in Spell Checker is turned off by default, for example.  Automatic spell-check replacement shouldn't even be an option, let alone turned on unannounced after an upgrade!  If users are mostly satisfied with what they've got, and upgrading is such a pain, why should they consider buying an upgrade?<br /><br />Interestingly, LibreOffice, which is more frequently upgraded than its commercial competitors -- and runs under multiple operating systems -- includes the best spreadsheet program.  PowerPoint, like it or not, is the eponymous term for its category.  So business PC users may need all three PC office packages.<br /><br />IMHO, Corel should consider offering WordPerfect to the open source community and selling support and tutorial services instead."
1,Worked Great
1,I've been using Quicken for several years now and feel it is easy to use and makes balancing my checkbook fast and easy too. I know it can do a lot more than I use it for and would recommend it to anyone.
1,"This is a decent version of Word / Excel for use on the Mac.  It doesn't have all the bells of the PC version (shocker!), but it has enough to make it reasonably functional.  If you're looking for every tip and trick to work on this version that normally works on a PC version, don't buy this.  If you're content with getting *most* of the stuff you want, then this purchase will work for you."
1,"I'm impressed with all the features this Norton product offers.  Actually I intended to buy the CD-ROM and install it on my devices, but bought the downloadable version instead.  I had a little difficulty with the first installation, but the other installations went smoothly.  I have been a devout Norton user for many years now.  Thanks for a great product."
0,"Close enough to Windows version for me, have to get use to small differences. Do not like not being able to hide graph on reminder page, it takes up a lot of my 13\\"" screen."
0,"This software is very buggy. I created an investment account and the share balance shows 549 in one line and after selling few shares it shows 1164. When I opened a chat session with a service rep, he asked me to do a lot of inane things for 40 mts. which did not fix the problem.  When I got frustrated and told him that he does not seem to know what he is doing, the rep just disconnected the session without saying anything."
1,works as expected
1,So easy to use and great downloadable content with paint colors and etc.
1,Avast is the best antivirus around.
0,"So disappointed - only upgraded from 2012 to 2013 for the mobile app, otherwise would not have spent the money. I first had some problems syncing with the desktop. Then they suddenly started working and I'm not sure why. My mobile app works with my credit cards but not with my Wells checking and savings. I've been back and forth with Intuit and I seem to be getting canned responses repeatedly requesting my logs. It's already been 2 weeks and it's still not working. I guess I will give it through the weekend and then request a refund. Bumemr :("
1,Am assuming it is wonderful. Have not had time to use it.
0,DO NOT order H&R Block Tax Software Premium & Business 2014 software! I just bought it and they downloaded 2013 which I already have and will not work for 2014 taxes! What is wrong with these people???? I will have to try to get my money back. Update: I contacted H&R Block's Customer Service by phone and they linked me to a download of the correct (2014) product.
1,easy and fun to use
1,Works great for my two Macs and my GF's Mac.  Plus I can install it on VM's if necessary.  The multiple licenses are great.
0,"My Software did NOT include state forms, and I could NOT download them from the Intuit site (some obsure message in 2013 about them being available Jan 4 2012!!).  I also found out i can NOT file electronically returns from 2011 in 2013.  I had to re enter all the information in another FREE software package after spending hours with Turbo Tax.  As a result, I discovered an additional tax savings using the other software.  After being a satisfied customer for years I am very disappointed.  I have asked for a refund but they say they don't give refunds on software......VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,"Spent lots of time deciding between this and Online Essentials version. Upgrading from 2012. If you need multiple users simultaneously, use the online version; it's perfect for that. This desktop version is much more robust and a better value for our tiny nonprofit. Converting from 2012 was seamless."
1,"I buy this every year.  It is cheaper than the one with the state and since they dont efile state for free why pay for the more expensive version when you can file online at the states web site for free any way.  Works great, use it every year and it transfers all my info over so easily and make the new years return a breeze! They whole family uses this.  A steal for the price...."
1,I love Microsoft Outlook. I have used it for years and enjoy a lot of features in this software. I would buy it again.
1,Love turbo tax
1,Its better than cable the channels are quick to respond collars great
1,"We have been using the free version of this anti-virus for over 5 years now. It has proven faster and easier to maintain than any other program (Norton, McAfee) previously used. Scans in background and has kept our computers virus free too. Even catches email problems. Recommended. Give it a try."
1,I use this Turbo tax To do my taxes works well old instructions and you'll get a good tax report will buy one next year also.
1,Great product at a very good price.  No issues with purchase or shipment.  Thank you for offering this product at a great price.
0,"Quickbooks is a product originally made for the PC, primarily made for the PC, and is begrudgingly modified and released for the MAC. The truth is, QB for Mac should not exist. The company doesn't even like the Mac platform, hates to update it, and could not care less about it's Mac users. My opinion is born from many frustrating years trying to use QB, trying to get support, answers to questions or just a nod. When you say \\""Mac\\"" they say \\""Uh, I'll have to transfer you....\\""<br /><br />I recently upgraded in hopes of fixing a bug that prevents the Accounts Receivable total from appearing on our Balance Sheet Summary Report...a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.

1,"Arived on time in perfect and working condition.<br />Installed it, downloaded and installed updates ready to use.<br />Did 1099 which are required early."
1,This virus scan came with my computer and it was good. I wanted it again and Amazon had the best price.
1,Quicken is very good for non-accountant users.  I have been using it for over five years and love the ability to download bank account information.
0,The software is full of bugs. It is not worth the money. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
0,"The delay in typing in the category, waiting for the category list to pull up, then waiting for the cursor to move to the correct category is insanely stupid and slow.  I regret that I even had to update Quicken for this reason alone.  I used to be able to enter my data quickly, now I have to wait for the category box to appear and scroll down.  Two thumbs down."
1,Nice
1,Use it every year
0,"I installed it on my Windows 8.1 uefi computer and it died a blue screen death within 3-4 minutes of booting up with the error: PNP_DETECTED_FATAL_ERROR. I rebooted 5 more times to confirm the problem, crashed every time.  My computer hasn't had a single problem for over a year until this installation of Norton Security 2015.  I uninstalled it and the computer runs fine again.  Now I've installed a trail version of AVG Internet security and there are no problems after the first hour.  I did install the Norton software on my other 2 computers, both Windows 7.x and they seem fine.  I will probably go with AVG from now on."

1,"One new feature I have discovered is the \\""Reminders to show in register\\"".  Though, I usually have it set for \\""Don't show reminders\\"", I like the ability to see the deposits and know expenditures projected for whatever period of time you select.<br /><br />There are still several issues that remain issues with the 2014 version:<br /><br />1) Bill and Income Reminders<br />When you select one of these and click on Enter, it's a crap shoot if it is actually recorded in the register, or just deleted/skipped, or whatever.  Even if you go to Tools/Manage Bill and Income Reminders and reset the date, the Enter button is ignored after editing.<br /><br />2) Investment Account<br />I have a Charles Schwab account that has several positions in FNMA and FHLMC Mortgage Backed Securities.  Either Charles Schwab is not sending the correct pricing to Quicken, or Quicken is not processing the information correctly, as the market value is not anywhere near the correct value.  From Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\""Because of the diversity in MBS types, there is wide variety of pricing sources. In general, the more uniform or liquid the MBS, the greater the transparency or availability of prices.[49] Most traders and money managers use Bloomberg and Intex to analyze MBS pools and more esoteric products such as CDOs, although tools such as Citi's The Yield Book and Barclays POINT are also prevalent across Wall Street, especially for multi-asset class managers. Some institutions have also developed their own proprietary software. Tradeweb is used by the largest bond dealers (the \\""primaries\\"") to transact round lots ($1 million and larger).\\""<br /><br />Since Charles Scwab uses Bloomberg to obtain the correct value, but Quicken does not, my net worth is always off for this account by at least 10% too high.  My work-around has been to create a dummy account with a single transaction that I occasionally (once/week) edit manually based on the on-line value of the true account.  The equation is Dummy Account Balance = Charles Schwab Account Balance On-Line - Charles Schwab Account Balance in Quicken.  The Dummy Account Balance is always negative, but it lowers my net worth accordingly so the net worth is correct.ount Balance = Charles Schwab Account Balance On-Line - Charles Schwab Account Balance in Quicken.  The Dummy Account Balance is always negative, but it lowers my net worth accordingly so the net worth is correct."
0,"I just tried to upgrade from Quicken 2012 and the program crashed after my 2012 was removed.  I have been a loyal customer since the beginning.  I have looked at all the reviews and thought that I wouldn't have the same luck.  After all, I have loved the program.  It has served me well until now.  No more.  I am through.  I am not going to go through all the hassles of trying to get this right.  I am sad to move on, but it is time to go.  I can't believe that Intuit has done such a poor job of providing an upgrade.  What a waste of money!"

1,I have been using this program for about 3 years. Consistent daily updates and never a problem. Great antivirus program. Highly recommended
1,Not bad for free
1,I love this tax software. It is so easy to use and follow. It makes doing my taxes a breeze.
1,have used a lot of antivirus programs-theirs is seamless and does not interfere with other programs.
1,"A friend turned me on to Avast about 5 years ago, and I've never thought about it again. I've installed it on numerous computers for the family since. Efficient, easy - it works great, has protected my computer, and even my mom has easily figured out how to use the program when needed to disinfect a file."
0,"I have used Avast for several years now on desktop and two  laptops and I like the protection that it affords. However, when you do upgrades you must be very careful because through the ads they sneak unwanted apps in if you forgot to 'uncheck' something.<br /><br />As long as these things are free it's  precaution you need to take but worth it."

1,"I have used this software for several years.  It has continually become more functional as time has passed.  It is a great product supported by a fantastic support services department.  This software is capable of importing your recipes from other software, text files, word files, internet images, and copied or scanned images.  It is uniquely functional and easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I have been using Cook'n since version 1, I think. I started out using Master Chef. It was very hard to use. Cook'n is amazing. It has an interface that allows you to import recipes from multiple sources. The manual input for recipes is about as easy to use as it can be. You can build your cookbook any way you want, with chapters that you set up and name. You can search many different ways including just in your cookbook or the entire internet. You can attach pictures and notes. You can even file tips with no recipe. I used to have over 100 cookbooks; my wife was military and travelled about 75% of the time, globally. Every country or state that she visited, she bought me a cookbook. I now have about 5. I rely on Cook'n completely. You can purchase (at a discount) or use a coupon code for a free cookbook every month. The entire cookbook is download to the Cook'n database. After importing it, you can move your favorites to your personal cookbook. Cook'n is a great piece of software for active cooks. There is a menu planner and a grocery list formulator, as well. The software works on PC, Mac, phones and iPads. Very versatile."

0,After using DAC Easy Light for many years; I find Quicken inadequate and confusing. Unfortunately my new computer with Windows 7 will not run Dac Easy Light. I have taken college level accounting many years ago; and find that DAC Easy Light more closely follows the clasic double entry accounting. So goes the GLORY of the world.
0,"the product download was the only good thing about this ordeal.  We routed our trip - first time we tried to open on the road, got a licensing message.  Turns out the only way to correct this error is to spend hours on the phone with a tec (Not the way I choose to spend my vacation)  MS has several &#34;fixes&#34; on line, but they did not work.  Don't waste yoiur time and money on this product."

As I completed my MBA studies about 16 years ago, I wanted to refresh my memory in this area and this course gave me that, although it can be an excellent tool also for those who do not have any idea about the stock market. Highly recommended."
1,This works as it should and meets all my needs.  The help is great!
1,My kids use this a lot for school projects.
1,Paid a great price compared to other sites. Turbo Tax performed like I have come to expect it to perform.
0,"To use it was easy enough the thing that got me though is that they still charged me for to do my state even though it said it was included. You had to agree by reading and checking the box for them to take their money directly. I will not use this product again, I will stick with turbo tax next year. I only bought this product because it was so much cheaper for the same thing, but now I know why you arent done paying for it if you wish to file your state electronically you have to pay a price :((( Totally misleading"
0,"I have used TurboTax Deluxe for eleven years without complaint and with full satisfaction. NO MORE! Intuit found a way to take  a winner and turn it into a platinum loser with the 2014 version! First, they cheapened the Software by eliminating specific forms and guidance tools. You don't find out that the Deluxe Version is inadequate for your needs (eg., lack of K-1 and Schedule D Forms, etc ) until you're midway through Tax Preparation; suddenly you are advised that you are required to upgrade to the Premiere Version and must pay and additional $30. Oh yes, Intuit came clean AFTER THE FACT and offered some rebates. Intuit also made it possible for Deluxe Buyers to get a free upgrade to Premiere. That process added insult to injury. You must call them while in the middle of your Tax Preparation(and go through an Easter Egg Hunt to find the correct phone number); then when you get to the warning page(stating upgrade required) you need to wait on hold for a lengthy amount of time(because there are so many confused and irritated customers on hold) and then when a service representative responds, you are asked for your product serial number. This info is buried in the &#34;warning&#34; page links and none of the service reps seem to know this. If you don't have the serial number, they won't authorize the upgrade or send you the required link. After being put on hold for ten more minutes, I terminated the call, fished through the page links, and found my product serial number. I then had to call again, stay on hold almost forever and repeat my entire issue to another apologetic Rep, to get the elusive, required upgrade link. So for 2014, if you want to take the road to hell, you must first make a stop at TurboTax Deluxe!"
0,It didn't really help me that much.  I had a hard time going back to change some of the items and I never did use the state return.  I did most of my return manually and returned it by mail!  You can blame the fact that I'm a senior citizen and find it hard to adapt to new systems!  (What I printed out did look a lot neater than my final return!)  Also it helped me to double check my work!
1,The third year I used Blocks tax software. Great deal with the number of efiles included. This version did not have the state program included and I did not notice until after the purchase.<br /><br />I think the Block program has everything the standard tax payer needs in a user friendly program . The number of efiles make this a great deal.
1,I am a long time user of Quickbooks Pro (QB).  I recently upgraded to QB Pro 2014.  I expected that the transition would be smoother than it actually was.  The new software couldn't read my older version data file and I had to contact Intuit Technical Support.  They were able to convert the file so that my new software could read the file.  Bottom line - The new QB is working well and the learning curve is not that bad once you understand how to backup and open your data files.<br /><br />Grace and Peace<br />jrm
0,Worst mistake ever.  This product kept trying to get me to upgrade for better protection.  I did it once to the tune or 19.00.  It did not help as promised.  It kept trying to get me to do an up grade for more money.  I finally bought McAfee and tried to delete Avast from my computer but it keep popping up trying to sell more products.  It will not go away.
1,"This is the first time I used Turbo Tax and will definitely use going forward. It was so user friendly, offerred great tips and detailed explanations. It covered things I hadn't even thought of and made the process as painless as doing taxes can be!"
0,"If I could give this company no stars I would but the scale requires 1.  I purchased the buggy software and paid 125.00 for it. Two weeks later, it dropped to 79.00. I called their horrible customer service department and I was not able to get a refund for the difference. 3 months have past since I purchased.  Since then I replaced my computer with a Mac.  I called Intuit to get the Mac serial number.  I was not looking for an upgrade or a new version, just the software to run on my new Mac.  They would not allow me to get the Mac version and told me I had two choices, I could repurchase the same software and they would give me a 10% discount, or I can purchase a 150.00 copy of parallels to allow me to run it.  This is after sitting on the phone for over an hour just to speak with someone over in India.  I have purchased a copy of the software every year for 9 years hoping they fix this crap they call software.  Their lousy customer service combined with their crappy coded software, I am ending this 9 year relationship and divorcing myself of this mess from Intuit. Oh and BTW...love what you did with Turbo Tax, as well. Goodbye Intuit, you lost a loyal customer!"
0,"The product installed just fine on my computer.  Had no issues with setup, and everything runs fine the problem I have with it, is that there is no way to make the font in the interface larger.  I have a UHD display,  and the software is practically useless due to the fact that you can't see anything. I'm extremely disappointed, and will not be buying any Adobe software in the future.  I'll be moving to another video editing platform asap.  I just wasted $100 on useless software."
1,EASY to use is all that I can say!<br />Great buy!.<br />Downloading software from Amazon is very convenient way to buy software.
1,Even Timothy Geithner could do this new and improved version... I think anyway.  I found it to be more helpful and easier to understand than even last year's version.  I sent it online and received my tax refund to my bank account not long thereafter.
1,For home use works as good or better than any other.  Have been using it for years with NO problems
1,"I almost did not buy Quickbooks Pro 2010 due to all of the reviews here on Amazon.  But I then spent some time reading reveiws other places and decided to make the purchase.  I am running Windows 7 64 bit, the download was fast, Installation was smooth the License number provided worked.  I did have to call in to register the product, but this took less then 3 minutes from the time I picked up the phone.      As for all of the complaints about the program continuing to try and sell you more quickbooks products,  there is a box on the the popup that you can check to turn off popups for that specific product.  It seems there are about 4 different products they are trying to sell you so, after checking dont show on all 4 they have stopped.  There have been alot of claims about this being a resource hog and locking up computers.  Honestly I just started using the product, but I have been monitoring my system and I can say for sure that this is not using much in the way of cpu or memory,  it does not seem to be doing any unexpected harddrive or network functions.  Also, the little amount that I have used the product I have not had any issues with my system.      In my case I would say the product is good for use."
1,Excellent!
1,Very satisfying purchase experience!
1,"If you want a solid immovable object; buy Apple.  For myself, I want what I want, not what Apple decides I can have.  There are literally billions of combinations of hardware, software and drivers available to PC/Windows users so some will inevitably have some incompatible issues or other problems.  This is not Offices' fault and you shouldn't base your decision on someone's bad hardware and configuration choices so ignore the \\""doesn't work\\"" reviews.  Try before you buy and you'll know how well this works in your configuration<br /><br />For me, it's been a great experience.  Compared to the cost of trying to keep full versions of Office up to date on my many devices, $100.00 is a steal.  Office 365 is simply Office delivered via the net.  No different than Office delivered on DVD other than it expires at the end of your subscription.  I bought the five-user Home Premium.  And again, the cost of upgrading multiple version of Office on each machine gets pricey; real pricey - this is bargain if MS keeps the cost reasonable.  I run it on a high-powered Windows 7 desktop; a Windows 8 desktop; a Windows 7 laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows 8).  Works perfectly on every device.  A great value."
1,"[[ASIN:B003GAMZFO Norton 360 Version 4.0 1 User/3 PC  [Download]]] This is this best and easiest way to buy, if you have a copy of Norton 360 already installed. Just get your new license and open Norton 360, click on My Account and then go to renew subscription just enter your new license #. It is just that easy. I love all the repair programs, on Norton 360. Great program!"
0,Got this because of many bad reviews on our usual Turbo Tax product; it was so difficult to use that my husband actually purchased Turbo Tax to complete our taxes this year.
1,Avast!  has worked well for me.  I am very impressed and now it is protecting my cell phone
1,Great product...!!!!
0,"Trying to follow the instructions, computer has required a couple of force quits, and hour on the phone with a gentleman who was of very little help, and his only solution was to suggest I hire someone.  Why don't I just hire a bookkeeper???<br /><br />I downloaded transactions from my checking account in a qbo file, the first time I did that it froze and I couldn't close it, required a force quit.  Did it again, they show up in something that looks like a check register, but they are not in the account they were downloaded to.  Asian gentleman on the phone says &#34;you have to transfer them into the register&#34; but cannot tell me how to do it.  And there is nothing on screen that gives me the first clue.  Tells me to hire someone.<br />Just for fun, did a search for a local pro and a search for quickbooks for mac turns up NO ONE within 30 miles of me!<br />Sorry-Do you refund?<br />I used Quickbooks for PC for years without these problems..."
0,"This is the worst software release ever. It is unbelievably bad. I've used Quicken since January of 1997 and while I've had many gripes over the years, I would be embarrassed to release software this bad. It seems to get worse with each release. Someone over there needs to be fired for their incompetence. I should have been suspicious when I saw 1/3 of the reviews are poor."
0,"Price & unlimited storage is excellent, made my choice to sign up a no-brainer. Missing from this web entity, and as sophisticated as Amazon is: a useful software interface. Provision for automatically timing the storage backups is an absolute basic, then multiple file versions, and alternatively, section by file type.  Thank you."
0,Turbo Tax.. the biggest scam I've ever encountered. Completely lied about &#34;free&#34;filing. Cost me over $100 to e-file using this scam product.<br />They got me once and I will never use this scam product again. I will tell anyone I know NOT to use it.<br />I also know that no one will read this review. I give it no stars.
0,"You can't trust the program - but anything else is worse.  If the government wants us to help save money with electronic filings, then other than a simple return, why don't they distribute software like they do paper forms and books?  It would cost the tax payers much less if they could D/L software rather than use paper.  Gosh I hate this time of year (not for the taxes - but dealing with Intuit!)"
1,"Avast keeps all my devices safe, PC and phone. And twice when my phone has gone home with someone else, Avast has made sure it returns to me ."
1,"The product works fine.  I've been a quicken customer and user since 1995.<br />Everything works.  I keep track of numerous income properties, personal investments and 8 or 9 different bank accounts and numerous assets and loans.  All good. What i am not particularly excited about is the requirement to upgrade every several years (since Quciken will block your bank transaction downloads if you DO NOT Upgrade).  Also, I have been asking for years for them to have a function whereby the data in Quicken can be loaded onto the Form 1003 (also known as a uniform residential loan application form).  Seems silly to have all this info in quicken only to have to print it all out and then RE-Enter it onto a paper 1003 form.  Oh well, why listen to 20+ year customers anyway?<br /><br />Scott T"
1,"Enough new additions to warrant a re-purchase since my 2006 version. Similar GUI for familiarity and ease of operation. Overall, worth the price for the included packages."
1,"I was disappointed to find that Turbo Tax has removed the simple Schedule C from the Deluxe version, so they can charge more money for this one.  We have a small business, and have always been able to use the Deluxe version for about $30 less, but not this year.  That being said, it is still very good software and just about anyone should be able to do their own taxes, then electronically file from home.  I use the software and do the taxes for several family members too, all for the one price. Other than the mysterious moving of the Schedule C, I am as satisfied as I have been since 2003, when I first started with this company."
1,Excellent
1,"I haven't had any real problems while using Norton.  I like the fact it scans facebook, emails and the internet."
0,"I have been a Quicken user for almost 15 years.  I usually go two or three years before I upgrade.  I decided to upgrade from a functioning but slow 2012 version.  Worst mistake ever.  This version has identified bugs such as losing investment data.  Quicken has been aware of this since October with no fix, and continues to sell the product.  Canned response is \\""known issue, patch pending.\\"" Best part yet, once you upgrade your data is not backward compatible, so you are stuck with the faults.  I have always been pretty pleased with Quicken and its support until now.  Very disappointing."
0,I have used Turbo Tax since I left public accounting and usually have a good experience.  Every time I start a return it states I can't save because the file is read only.  Poor experience this year.
1,"Had a little trouble at first, as I was used to using the one for PC. The format is a bit different, but easy enough to understand.  Another great product!"
1,good
1,"I have been using Quicken or Quickbooks and various versions of their payroll service for over 20 years, and it has always been a time savor and very efficient service. Tracking on payroll and payroll taxes and reports has always been right to the penny. I have a private medical practice and this is a time saving program and an accounting blessing :)"
1,this product is well worth it. I do some youtube videos and I gotta say the ease of use with this product is simply amazing and blows a lot of other video editing software out of the water. i have found my product of choice.
0,"We have been using quickbooks for about 7 years and used to upgrade every 3 years because intuit drops off email support after the product is 3 years old and we must have that to email estimates and invoices.  Last year I got connected with a salesman who set me up with a PRO PLUS subscription bundled with enhanced payroll...since we already use both for my 2 construction businesses and it also included intuit data protect and QB mobile  and 24/7 support.  Total cost for the year was $470 for subscriptions plus monthly fees for direct deposits...about $1.50 per direct deposit.  I was concerned with the introductory rate this year and next year you are addicted and the price goes way up.  Salesman sent told me to expect a very small increase and quoted it for next year at $499 up from $470.  This seemed acceptable and my invoice reflects those numbers...which i printed out.  The upgrade and conversion was not painless...tax info was a mess, intuit data protect quit working and tech support is a 3 hour phone call...3 times now and it still does not work.  I also was very interested in the mobile feature that was new to me but it got discontinued before we got to use it.<br /> Now it is a year later and time to renew and they want $640 vice the $499 promised.  I have been on the phone with QB customer care for 54 minutes and spoken to 2 ladies who do not speak English with any skill.  I have asked to speak to a supervisor 2 times and no supervisor has been on the line.  WOW.  Very Frustrating.  BEWARE this<br />Been on the phone now 62 mins and waiting for sales now.<br />Sales was on the line after only 2 minutes...imagine that and he spoke english<br />-Cancelled the pro plus subscription and renewed the enhanced payroll at a &#34;sale that ends tomorrow rate&#34; of $235/year plus Direct deposit fees.<br />One hour and 15 minutes I will never get back.  Good Luck small business owners."

1,This free Antivirus is by far the best there is. it keeps you updated and provides you with importing info. i would recommend this to all my friends and family.
0,"I am using Windows XP and my Dell desktop computer is equipped with adequate memory (4GB) and enough hard disk capacity. I downloaded Photoshop Elements 10 as this remains as one of the best organizing tools for photos. However, Adobe apparently did not find the ways to solve critical problems such as the import of previous catalogs with the expected quality. I did this several times and could not understand the reasons why the software does not bring all photos as they were in the previous Elements version. In addition, sometimes the program stops in the middle of my operations and often I lose my work. It is also frequent that it does not load when I choose the icon on the screen or even when I select to start the program list in the windows panel[[ASIN:B005MMMT6E Adobe Photoshop Elements 10]]. It is necessary to restart the computer in order to get the access again to the program."
0,"I have been a Quicken user from almost Day 1 and loved the product until this new 2014 version.  One, it really hasn't changed since 2013 and since I have a SurfacePro notebook the fonts and formats are all messed up.  I called Quicken and they agreed that there were issues with it running on SurfacePro and were not able to tell me when fixes were coming down the pike.  Wait till 2015 to buy the next version if you have a SurfacePro."
1,It's definitely awesome for the price!
1,Excellent product! High quality
1,"My third year with Norton 360. Very pleased with the results. I have never used any other anti-virus, spyware/malware product, but I cannot envision any results."
1,works too well almost broke my laptop cleaned so well
1,Avast is one of the best in early detection and protection and I'm using the free version.  One can only imagine what the upgrade software would do.

1,"If you are like me and are always constantly forgetting when to pay your bills each month, Chronicle is the solution for you. Here is what I love about it!<br /><br />1. Bill Reminders: This is probably the best feature of the app. You can get custom reminders for your bills each month either synced through iCal or email reminders. This ensures that you never miss a bill again.<br /><br />2. Great User Interface: Chronicle is very easy to use and very intuitive. It doesn't take much for you to start creating your own bills and using the app.<br /><br />3. Other Features: Chronicle can store receipts and helpful information to help you analyze how much you pay each month on your bills.<br /><br />Go ahead and check it out, I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the service."
0,LIKE AN IDIOT I thought I was getting a great deal and downloaded this program and guess what it is for 2010 not 2011. So now I just paid for OLD software download! UGGH I could just scream!
1,It was easy to install and everything works as it should.
1,"I love the new Cook'n!  I've been using Cook'n for several years and the newest one is even better!!  I have it synced between my main computer, my tablet AND my iPhone.  Now, wherever I am I can share my recipes or see what ingredients I need at the grocery store.  (The program has grocery list capabilities but I love the fact that I can find what I need on the fly.)<br /><br />I'm one of those people who surfs the web looking for recipes and until I got the updated Cook'n I would print out the recipe I wanted to try.  Unfortunately I have a stack of unsorted recipes that I may never have time to go through looking for a particular one.  Last night I created a new cookbook and named it \\""Internet Downloads\\"".  I went through my stack of recipes, found them on the internet and \\""captured\\"" them into my new folder.  As I try out the recipes I'll move them into my personal cookbook.  I haven't tried to capture any off blogs but foodnetwork.com, food.com and allrecipes are among the websites that I captured from last evening. There are many, many other sites as well.<br /><br />I'm also very pleased with their customer support.  I inadvertantly registered the Cook'n Cloud from my iPhone app instead of the computer where all my recipes are stored and they helped me correct the problem.  Soon all 3 devices were synced!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this program!"

0,Do not purchase this. I purchased it because it is supposed to be so much better than microsoft word but it is not. I cant even re-coop my money back. Product is horrible
0,"I far prefer the older versions of Microsoft Publisher.  This one seems needlessly complicated, but that is sort of the way of anything Microsoft.  Their motto seems to be, if it ain't broke, let's fix it anyway.  I have used MS Office products for years.  Really since they were first introduced, so I will continue to do so.  I do hope these versions (2013) will be supported for a long time to come."
0,"I do not recommend buying this program if it does not work you will lose money. Amozon not return the money, will put a thousand excuse and registration problem for the program is a pure disgrace and frustration.

0,"TotalMedia Theatre 5 worked generally fine on Windows 7 - with problems on rendering Top Menu for some bluray movies.  For those movies, you have to be really creative to figure out a way to pass a Top Menu screen without a click-able menu item (I couldn't remember how, but it took me a while).<br /><br />After installed Windows 8, the 5 started to have serious staggering bluray play back.  And my PC is running on a Sandy-Bridge Intel i5 2550K processor.  Now Arcsoft asks $9.99 for the version 6 upgrade even though the version 5 was bought less than a year ago.

1,Had issues downloading ran into a loop.  Had to call tech support Nino Carlu V was great.  Had to let him remote in and was working within 20 minutes.  Good news it wasn't just me he had to change some things around from the download.  Sure it was my fault for not waiting until fully downloaded before trying to launch but glad it was resolved quickly

0,I signed up for Office 365 back in Jan/Feb time frame.  Starting off it failed to install on a new Dell desktop running Windows 7 Professional with 8 gig of ram memory and a 1.5 terabyte hard drive.  I called Microsoft tech support and they assured me that they could get it installed.  They had control of my computer for over 18 hours and six different techs up to senior techs ( or so they said).  After repeatedly failing to get it working properly they said that I had a virus.  BULL SH......  They then started to give me a run around to different departments and they finally just uninstalled it but left a number of other problems. The major one is that office and excel will not work in the administrative mode.  Some of my programs will not work with Outlook and Excel as it apparently only will load in the standard mode.  The problem seems to be that the User Account Administrator (?) does not work.  After many more calls and switching between departments I was mysteriously switched over to a company called Group Resolve (apparently one of their subcontractors)  They also failed to resolve the problem.  Whoever is responsible for this abortion should have their employment terminated.  THANKS A LOT MICROSOFT!!!

1,This is a wonderful product.  I have always had my taxes done by an accountant.  This year I decided to try TurboTax and I was<br />amazed at how simple the process was.  Turbotax simply asks you questions and you answer them and it populates your tax<br />documents for you. I will order TurboTax every year.  Make sure you have a copy of your previous year's return as some questions<br />refer to that document.
0,The street atlas is good but it was hard to navigate it. We downloaded the instruction manual which helped a great deal.
0,It works fine after you enter the product key. The problem is that you have to enter it every time you reboot.
1,"I have been using Norton 360 for 3 years now, it's just as good as it gets. I used to hate norton in the past because it was just so invasive, would slow the computer down & take up a ton of space, not any more.<br /><br />I do computer work for 2 local motorcycle dealerships & help many elderly neighbors with computer problems, it works for all of them.<br />The dealerships get slow in the winter which seems to force salesman to looking at the worst of the net, we have not has a single virus since we started using norton. It's great for my 85 year old dad & the rest of my elderly neighbors also. Some other brand's firewall asks way too many question for older people, norton does not. Older people are also targeted by game & coupon malware programs & viruses, norton just seems to block them well, even when they click ok on them."

0,"It is a great project management software, but I wish they made the interface and functions more easier to work with (with a tools side strip and a page interface more like the drawing software CorelDraw. And the easy key functions of CorelDraw for charting the steps, days and times). For example, the tools strip should include a text box maker, which is positional anywhere on the page area, within the printable boundaries, which should be shown. Such text box maker tool should be with the choice of width and color of the box border, or no border, and a font tool that allows one to use all of the fonts installed on the OS, and allow the text itself to be stretchable vertically and horizontally or back to normal, and with the basic choices of regular, bold, italic, underlined, text to the right, left, centered, or justified. It should also include a photo and art box maker for headshots of those who work on the project, which could browse the computer for any picture format. It should also have a separate connector tool for tapping on at minimum on at least five points to each of the four sides of a created box, whether for text or picture, and dragging a line to a point on the next box, which line is also variable in width and color."
1,"This is a very useful program, which I am using to file the final taxes for my mother's estate.  The main drawbacks that I have found so far:  There is no state return included (as with the individual); you cannot import financial institutions' data on dividends and interest (as with the individual); and all this for roughly three times the cost.  I wish they had a program that dealt more specifically with estates and such, especially since investments are often complicated to enter."
0,At the end I still had pay 19.99 to file after I had paid amazon to start with ?
1,"The product worked as it should, so it deserves a good rating.  Doing taxes is not my idea of having fun, however, so the four stars is more of a reflection of my distaste for the task than a comment about the product.  I recommend TurboTax highly.  They've put together a very functional product for a modest price."
0,"I expected TurboTax Premier to be good, but it turned out to be useless for me. The main problem for me was that the tax treaties were not built in the software. I know many people use treaties for tax return. Don't know why TurboTax just ignore this need. I had to file the tax return manually after paying the money."

0,"Very disappointed with this item, I would not recommend it. I tried to get a refund,  and it is over priced."
0,"I am not computer wise and purchased this software (trustingly) to rid my computer of diverse slop I evidently picked up over time rom the internet, plus speed up my computer .  After the download, all I got was various add-on \\""come ons\\"", and more pop up windows from the makers--they automatically changed my homepage during the 'install', made it difficult to change it back.  Additionally, when you begin procedures to run the device, it pops up so many \\""update bargains\\"" (\\""free updates\\"", etc.) that you can't tell what is already there, from what they want to have you download.  Overall, this is a rook--a big package of value-added-profit in mind, and I want my money back, but don't know how to get it.  This is a big download of problems, and I would avoid it at all costs--meaning, I would now pay to get rid of it.  However--I'm afraid to  uninstall it, for what it might do during the attempt.  Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling horsefeathers like this."
1,"there is not a lot to say about this product, it arrived on time and was as  described, was easy to understand and it was well worth the money"
1,"I am a regular subscriber and it covers most issues very well.  I've used Norton for many years and prefer it to McAfee.  It covers ad ware pretty well, although it's a good idea to have a ad-ware and spyware backup."
0,"Long time quicken and turbotax user (since 90's).  I decided to upgrade to QW2014 take advantage of the mobile access features, especially the feature where you can take/store a picture of receipts.<br /><br />The program simply doesn't work as advertise.<br /><br />Mobile sync features (I use Bank of America):  You get to select which accounts you want to see mobile (iphone/Ipad in my case).  I have a problem that I set up and sync accounts and I can see them on a mobile device (once anyway).  Everyday the program forgets which accounts I set up and I'm forced to go in on my desktop and have to reset up the accounts.  I've tried to contact tech support...but you can forget about talking to an actual person.  Even with submitting my question online, I've yet to get a response (that was 5 months ago). I;ve since given up trying to resolve or use the feature.  Additionally, the receipt feature (taking a picture of a receipt) would hand my phone about 80% of the time (I would have to force close the program and re-open)<br /><br />The most recent update (R7) has taken to triplicate my checking and savings account every time I try to use one-step update.  It completely screws up my accounts and I have to restore from a backup.  So I'm forced to go to each account manually (5 accounts) and download transactions individually.  I've tried to deactivate and reactivate all the accounts...to no avail<br /><br />As a long time quicken user, I'm severely disappointed and I'm starting to research alternative programs. Too much hassle, too much time and blood pressure too high dealing with QW2014."
0,When I needed to amend my taxes the program was difficult to work and gave me different results that i couldn't submit.
1,Excellent purchase
0,"I downloaded this to my desktop which has Windows XP. This product states that it is compatible with my version of Windows. It downloaded ok, but when I try to open, I get an error. I've uninstalled and re-installed and am still not able to open. I sent a request for help through e-mail to Crayola and it's been over 2 months and still no response. Very disappointed at the moment that my grandkids are not able to enjoy this. :("
1,"I've been doing my taxes by computer for over 20 years. As I suspect is the case with a great many taxpayers, my tax picture doesn't change much from one year to the next. It is so nice to have a program like TaxACT that doesn't treat you as if you've never prepared an income tax return before.  I love TaxACT's direct form entry. I simply import last year's return, enter my W2 data and I'm off to a good start. I bypass the step-by-step handholding and &#34;interviews&#34; because after 20+ years I've kind of got the hang of it.  The program is stable; I've never encountered a bug with TaxACT and have never needed their technical support. The program automatically checks for state and federal updates throughout tax season, and updating takes but a mouse click. One small inconvenience is that I'm never sure when they have finished issuing updates. I don't file until the beginning of March anyway because that is when all of my brokerage data is available.  The process of importing brokerage data has improved over the years. The instructions are complete and easy to understand, and it imports all of my 1099-B data including form 8949 transactions and schedule B data; everything is directed to the proper place on the proper form. I must still figure my form 4952 data manually but you can't have everything.  I use the downloaded version so I can't speak to the on-line version, which you would probably want to use if you're not running Windows. I think it would be nice if the downloaded version had some kind of cross-platform support. For security reasons I'm not comfortable with having my personal income-tax data on line, so as a Windows user I prefer to use the downloaded version. I also use the state version of TaxACT and it makes filling out a state return ridiculously easy.  I have serious reservations about using TurboTax or any other Intuit product for that matter. Several years ago TurboTax was messing with people's hard disk sectors and that did not sit well withme. I have tried the H&R Block program, but their direct-form-entry interface is horrible. They use a small font with black characters on a medium-gray background. I had to strain to see the numbers, so I got rid of it and enthusiastically went back to TaxACT.  One tiny flaw this year was that, when printing out my return for filing, it did not print schedule B even though there was data on it, but it was a trivial matter to print out a separate copy of the form."
1,"It was fast, easy and I had no trouble installing it."
0,"I thought I would give it try to get away from updating my spreadsheets. But I can still track, organize, and build charts for the data that I want with my spreadsheets more easily then this poorly written program. I just switched banks also, and the bank has better budgeting software on their website for FREE. I want my money back, but I dont know if I can since it's a downloaded program. I will try any way."
0,"The so called &#34;improvements&#34; are really just changes so they can sell an upgrade. You have to get used to the changes, which some times are better and some times they are worse."
1,"Downl;oaded fine. Installing was not as smooth as I would have expected, but once installed works fine"
0,I switched from Turbo Tax this year and don't think H&R Block is as user friendly.
1,It was so easy to download and the price was much better than anywhere else.  Just make sure you don't auto-renew and  pay the full price at renewal time.
1,Great Product! Much different then I am used to but I have to say I like the upgrade from my old office!
1,"I'm not exactly sure how my computer would be if I didn't have this software, but it says it finds viruses and contains them, so I'd rather be safe.  I'm not really sure what it does when it finds viruses, or how confined they are, but my computer is virus free, so I'm happy."
0,"just adequate, missing some forms"
1,This program is better than I expected.  I'm used to using an older version.  This one is easier to use in my opinion.
0,"I decided to buy it since my trial versions was up in 2 days and it had been working well with no hiccups. So I bought it and entered the code into my existing McAfee version already running on my computer, it said I had to still re-download it from scratch even though I had an existing version on my computer. Okay, no biggie, re-downloaded it. So 10 mins later after its completely done and I go to start-up my Blizzard game; I am prompted to download updates for my game. Not a problem, as I have had to do this done this 3 times already since buying the game. All the sudden, it wont download. It says content is blocked. I then disable the firewall in McAfee; still wont download. I try disabling everything, filters, I check my connections making sure my game has permission to upload; still wont download. At this point I go into chat mode with Mc Afree, being walkthrough how to disable it. Still wont work and having exhausted all the options she had, she says a window setting is blocking it, its not the software. I tell her the software caused this; how I have had the trial, downloaded this game several times before; I even tried my other computer in the house and it downloaded todays update no problem. Mope, she claims its a &#34;coincidence&#34; that downloading this and having problems happened today. BS. After spending another hour trying to do walkthroughs from Microsoft to fix the problem; I am forced to reboot the entire computer from factory settings and am downloading the game, guess what? the game now downloads.<br /><br />The problem is this software changes your firewall configurations and even being a novice gamer whom isn't new to computers, I still could not figure out what the hell it did. Stay away from this software and be advised it will mess up your ability to download content."
0,"This is my first time using Quickbooks.<br /><br />I was very dissapointed in the quality of the interface.  It looked like a poorly designed 1997 interface.  Clunky at best.<br /><br />The product seems bloated and ran slowly with stoppages.<br /><br />Often windows would not be big enough for the content that they had and there would be no way to increase their size.<br /><br />The rudamentary email sending for invoices didn't allow me to attach other documents (support docs for the invoice), nor could I produce a PDF so I could send the email myself.<br /><br />The search in help was poor - not finding answers to questions that I know had to be in the database.<br /><br />These are all things I observed in about an hour with the product.<br /><br />Perhaps Inuit is abandoning the install version for the SAS (online) version and has stopped working on the install version.<br /><br />I was really shocked at the poor usability of this software.  One of the worst I've seen in years."
1,"I use TurboTax every year.  It has always been easy to use and straight forward.  The interview style can seem tedious, but it is needed to make sure you don't miss anything.  The software is updated frequently and the import from the previous year data is seemless if the same software was used."
0,"I figured out the software pretty easily without use of the manual.  If I had to explain even basic concepts to my in-laws and even some of my friends, though, I would be tearing my hair out.  This is NOT for everyone.  Consider this: if you constantly pester your kids or your IT/tech-savvy friends with basic computer stuff, just stick to pen and paper and your mind's eye.<br /><br />There are many, many plants, trees, shrubs.  Many, many.  I thought I read a previous reviewer claim there were only 50.  Wrong.  If you are looking to add an addition or a deck and some flower gardens and such, then this might be for you.  If you're like me and seeking full xeriscaping ideas, save your money now.<br /><br />I assumed incorrectly that a \\""Landscape and Deck\\"" edition of a designer software would provide much more flagstone, paver, brick ideas.  There are some, but very limited in patterns, colors, etc.  I am very disappointed and would return this if I could."
0,"I had used Norton 360 for several years and liked it. I had no problems while using it. I bought a new computer 2 weeks ago. I downloaded Norton Security without problems. I like the way it performs continuous scans in the background and gives indicators of whether websites are safe. However, a malware program got onto my new computer that called itself &#34;cassopesia&#34; (I am not sure of the spelling). It was a pseudo Internet search engine that would launch itself whenever I tried to use Internet Explorer or Firefox. The malware did not cause any harm to my computer, but it prevented me from using the browsers I wanted to use. It also allowed countless ads to appear on my computer, even though I had installed Adblock for both IE and Firefox. Norton Security did not detect that the program was on the computer. I called the 800 number for customer service. Apparently, Norton has farmed out its customer service to a third party. Even though I had just paid for the program, I was told I would be charged $249.99 to have the malware (that Norton Security missed) removed from my computer. I felt I had no choice because the computer was unusable as it was and I had to access the Internet to work on a project for work that was due that night. I was told that the fee would include a free year of Norton Security. The customer service representative that assisted me used two freeware malware removal programs and never did remove the malware or 2 other programs (adware) that had installed themselves. He was able to get IE and Firefox to work, although he admitted that &#34;cassopesia&#34; was still on my computer. I was able to complete my project that night and meet my deadline for work. I then had time to research malware removal programs the next day. I found online reviews that stated that Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is the best program of its type. There is a free version that just scans when you ask it to; it then removes the malware that it found. The commercial version will scan continuously in the background and alert you if malware is detected. It will then remove the malware. I downloaded the freeeware version and ran a scan. It immediately found the &#34;cassopesia&#34; malware that the 2 programs that Norton Security Customer Service failed to detect. Malwarebytes removed that program as well as the 2 adware programs that Customer Service identified but could not remove. I am not saying not to buy Norton Security because it does do some things well. However, it also misses some malware, and its customer service practice comes close to extortion. I will continue to use it because I have almost 2 years of service paid for, but after that I will explore other options.  Addendum: 7/6/2015 I would like to upgrade my rating to 3 stars from 1 star. Apparently the program that downloaded itself onto my computer is called a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP). Here is what Norton's customer service told me today: &#34;Potentially Unwanted Programs do not fall into the definition of harmful software; hence Norton does not detect those as a threat.&#34; Apparently I had a PUP on my computer that scammed me. Norton stated today that they do not charge for customer service. I would rate Norton Security higher than 3 stars if it detected and removed PUP's. The PUP apparently directed me to an 800 number connected to the PUP and not to Norton Security's customer service. Live and learn, I guess. Hopefully, this will help someone else."

1,"I have used AVAST in the free version for at least the ten years. While I try to avoid the known dangerous sites, it has caught and controlled every virus thrown my way. At one point I decided to try another very popular antivirus product that had rave reviews online. Caught a virus within the first week. AVAST is just the best antivirus product I have ever used."
0,"First off, let me just say that it seems like a very good program, and I really like how it resembles Adobe Lightroom in functionality. It seems a bit more \\""advanced\\"" than most video editing software programs in its price range... which is a good thing in my opinion. I will update this posting as I delve more into it, but for the price it seems very versatile, with a lot of good export options.<br /><br />This is a possible fyi for those of you using other legacy Adobe products in conjunction with it. Let me explain:<br />I use the Adobe Design Premium CS5 suite (not really looking to upgrade to CS6 yet). However, A few days back I installed a new SSD hard drive, and commenced with a fresh install of Windows 7. The trial of Premiere Elements 11 was the first Adobe product I installed, and it ran great. Today, I decided to install the CS5 suite (transferring all licenses according to Adobe protocols). The install went as planned. Then when I tried to \\""update\\"" the CS5 products (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, etc...), the Adobe Application Manager gave me an error, and none of the CS5 products were able to be updated including Camera Raw (not good). Sadly, since this is a new product, there doesn't seem to be a lot of available info available on the web.<br /><br />My next steps...<br />I think that the software from Premiere Elements 11 installed before the CS5 install threw a monkey wrench in to things. So here's what I did:<br />- Uninstall all Adobe products. Back up everything first (files, Premiere Element 11 Catalogs (use the web to figure out where Adobe hid this), etc...)<br />- Download the Adobe Creative Suite Cleaner from Adobe - follow the instructions in the included documents. This is the only way to get everything off the computer.<br />- Restart your computer<br />- Install the CS5 or lower version suite. After install, run your updates. (Updates were successful!)<br /><br />This is where I stopped. I plan on re-installing the Premiere Elements 11 software. I just hope that I can run CS5 updates after going through all of this. Primarily Camera Raw updates (this is the most important update for me).<br /><br />I'll follow up soon with any more issues... and an overview of the product itself.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Update #1:<br />Re-installed Premiere Elements 11 software, and ran the updates.<br />Same error... darn.<br /><br />However, on a good note, I really like the features and functionality of Premiere Elements 11. I think that it is worth sitting tight until a fix is released.<br />(I take off one star for the conflicting software issue)<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Update #2:<br />After using this software for about a week, I am very happy with it. The only knock so far for me is the lack of being able to scroll through the list of fonts. The up / down arrows make it a painfully slow process. Great software for the price-point.oftware.

1,"I starting using Quicken years ago and loved it.  Then, it went away for the Mac and was replaced with Quicken Essentials.  I switched because of my love for Quicken, but Essentials was not the same and offered far less in features and convenience for my needs.  When I received the e-mail announcing the new edition of Quicken, I debated buying it for fear of losing it agin some time in the future.  However, I did buy and download it, and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Thank you for re-introducing the financial program that is exactly what I need for the ministry here.

0,Bait & Switch comment was correct. No where does it say that it is a trial before you waste your time downloading it!!!
0,I don't know if it's coincidental but my computer keeps getting frozen after installing this. Horribly slow and doesn't even shut down. so annoying.
0,"This product was slow, annoying (quite a bit of spam), and basically useless as far as I could tell.  Steam seems to have most of the same features with less annoyance factors."
1,"Well, it's not the full Photoshop but It is a good program for the money."
1,I have you both HR Block and its competitors (both software and online) for the better part of a decade and firmly believe that this product is the easiest to use.  I find its interviews easy to follow even for my most complex tax questions.  I like the import feature which allows me to do tax returns for me and my wife as well as my two older kids in one evening. The Deluxe package is a good compromise of features for someone will a relatively straightforward return.  The download couldn't be easier and the price is extremely reasonable.
0,"Our library has this game. It is terribly written. The challenges themselves are okay, but it requires a lot of reading for the age level. It requires lots of drag and drop, which is a hard skill, but I don't mind that terribly. It's a reasonable skill to learn (harder still is the fact that Windows mice have the abominable second button, which is not used by the game so ought to work the same as the first button). The real problem, though, is that the details are not well-thought through. For example, the child is asked to drag items into the box with the matching color, but while magenta and pink are similar colors, they are different enough to be confusing. Also, some of the items contain colors from more than one box, also confusing. On most of the drag and drop games, the drop doesn't work unless you are very precise in your placement. Rather than going with a more typical bounding box-bounding box partial intersection is a drop success, it requires a total intersection, which is ridiculous. It would be hard for most adults."
1,Meets my needs and quite user friendly to install
1,"I e-filed my 2014 taxes using HR Block's tax software and I can say that the experience was easy, albeit a little new to me. I was a TT user for a long time but have grown weary of it for the past few years and this year's problems have finally convinced me to move to H&R Block. TT may still have the upper hand on user interface but not by much.  I had to prepare my taxes twice before I filed because I missed a deduction the first time I did it. It was my mistake though for not checking the correct boxes when prompted by the software. I also could have just gone to the part that I missed but I decided to start from the beginning anyway just in case to make sure I did not miss anything else.  The whole process was easy and just before I e-filed it prompted me to fix some issues to ensure that everything is correct. The e-file process went without problems and you can track the status from software itself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It is easy to use and what you get for the cost is excellent."
1,Turbo tax is a great way to do your income taxes. It walks you through each step and constantly checks for errors. Highly recommend
1,"If you want to turn your old receivers into bluetooth capable receivers, this is what you need.  This unit works flawlessly and is about the lowest price for this type of unit.  My only minor complaint is that it does not &#34;beep&#34; when you connect your device.  The beeping sound of the logitec version is helpful to audibly let you know that you are paired correctly without actually playing anything from your device."

0,"After purchasing this product I downloaded it using amazons provided down-loader. When I first tried to run the installer it showed me the install screen but didn't do anything when I clicked install. I located the installer executable and ran that which seemed to work until the very end when it told me that some post install program failed to execute and then proceeded to remove the install. I am on a Win7 PC and decided to try again by setting the installer compatibility to Win7 under the program preferences. This got the software to install but when I ran it and entered the serial number it then prompted me to enter a CD into my CD drive! What CD are they referring to!!! This was a download purchase. I tried contacting the producer of the software (Smith Macro)and after waiting 40 minutes in their \\""Live Chat\\"" queue I received a message: \\""Status: Canceled There are no agents available to chat with you right now. Please try again later.\\"". Frustrated I contacted Amazon - who have much better customer service and they were surprised by the software asking for a CD. I still have yet to get this to work and I would warn anyone else that you will experience pain and frustration if you buy this software."

1,"I got this program for my 12-year old son.  He had previously been using the 'Sponge Bob' typing program and I didn't think that that program was working well.  In comparison, 'Typing Instructor' is much better.  It presents lessons in a logical manner, monitors progress well and has a reward system that motivates even a 12-year old to keep practicing.  I was initially afraid that the program wouldn't be 'fun enough' for my son, be he seems to like it.  For the price, it's a great deal."

Thankfully I had my iPad with me, so I looked online, couldn't find the answer there, so called the number on the screen.  I was put on hold and waited, in the store, for over 15 minutes.  Hung up.  This was just to inquire about the product before purchase.  What a phony, unfriendly company!  I guess customer service is not important to them.  They must be rich!"

0,I'm really not impressed. I had used previous versions of Quicken several years ago and thought that it was easy to use and a great program. I just downloaded 2015 and they have not made any technological advances that I would have expected. The program is also much more glitchy.
1,Great Program. User interface is intuitive and easy to use. I have converted multiple formats. Great program to have in your toolbox
1,Very useful software at amazing price
1,"Rewards are integrated into the teaching, so that the kids don't even know that their learning is being reinforced with directed play."
1,"Turbo Tax takes the stress of filing long forms!  It asks all the right questions and if you have questions they respond with useful help suggestions.  They have quick response time to the questions and are very thorough in collecting information.  It is easy to understand as well as the directions are stated clearly. If for some reason I get interrupted after starting or need to collect additional information to complete a section, I am free to do that and continue at a more convenient time.  I have been using it for years and it has proved more valuable then of the tax places or individuals I have  used in the past. I plan to use Turbo Tax Deluxe again for 2014.."
1,"He calificado cinco estrellas a este producto debido a que me llegó en buenas condiciones sin ningún tipo de novedad al respecto y han cumplido con mis expectativas por eso lo recomendaria a familiares, amigos etc. Gracias"
0,"I'm an electrical engineer and experienced computer user. I spent a couple of hours trying to produce a usable DVD with this software, with no success. I'm using Windows 8 and DVD+R discs. I tried 2 different brands of discs and 2 different DVD players. I tried 3 of the different types of projects that this software allows: menu-based, picture compilation, and single movie. I tried using their Show Me How tutorials. I tried using JPEG's and then a wmv file. None of this worked. In every case the DVD that was burned could not be loaded by my DVD players. What a waste of time and money."
1,What a deal i found paying 35 buck for software that rocks works like a well oiled machine!!! peace to all
0,First time using this software had problems printing the forms.
1,"I'e been using Quicken for over 15 years I believe. I do not use many of the more sophisticated functions - I really just track and verify bank, credit card and investment accounts and use Quicken to reconcile and have an easy to use record where I can find a record of financial details. But it works well. Because I don't do any fancy stuff, I can't really tell the difference from earlier versions. I just update every few years so credit card companies and banks and such still support downloads. I only read poor reviews for Quicken for Macs so although I have a Mac I buy Quicken for Windows and use it with VM Fusion on a virtual machine. I wish Intuit would make a high quality Quicken for Macs."
1,It does not slow down the speed of my computer. It works much better than<br />competing products I had used
1,Guides you through the health care part of the return.
0,"Upgrade -- not!  These budgeting features were *removed* from Quicken2011 functionality:(1) Ability to set a budget year other than the calendar year, (2) Ability to budget *yearly* amounts (Quicken2013 only allows *monthly* budget amts)"
0,"I purchased Quicken Home & Business 2014 in April 2014 after being forced to upgrade from Quicken 2011 due to Intuit's mandatory 3 year upgrade rule. I have had several stocks and mutual funds with different names, but the same stock symbols since Quicken 1997 in different accounts without trouble. However, Quicken 2014 has started deleting duplicate name variation securities (e.g. stocks, mutual funds, etc) from my register and security list. The deleted securities are replaced by blank entries, and the stock name disappears from all lists in Quicken. The problem started by getting mismatches in the number of share in Quicken vs number of shares downloaded from my brokerage. The number of shares were in fact the same, only the share name was slightly different, but the ticker symbol was the same. The problem occurs when you have different names for the same stock symbol in different accounts (e.g. IRA vs UTMA). Quicken 2014 will only allow 1 name to survive, and delete all the other names, and screw up your transaction history as well as all your reports (e.g. capital gains reporting!) Quicken 2014 automatically noted the name change, but when I accepted the change for 1 version of the name, the other names would be completely wiped from all the other brokerage registers.  I spent 2 to 3 hours on a chat with a customer care person, and was finally transferred to a &#34;specialist&#34;, who admitted within just 2 to 3 minutes that this was a bug that had no fix yet. The fix will probably occur in release R8 of Quicken 2014 in August 2014.  First, the specialist also admitted that they do not have good contact with their software engineers, second the specialist is not sure if the bug will in fact be fixed in R8, and third it should not take 2 to 3 hours to tell a customer that this is an unresolved bug. It turns out this bug was 1st noted 7 months ago by dozens of others on Quicken's official community web page, and has been causing long time Quicken users many hours of manual fixing."
0,"Used HR Block tax program for several years. Got mad at them for offering an extra which was not correct. Goodby. Got Turbo tax from you this year and fought my way though it. Too many problems. Now I see it on sale for less than I paid for it. Guess I am going to get rid of Turbo Tax AND Amazon. Do not like being ripped off. May be the American way to do business, but not mine."
1,I have usef turbo tax for years now works fine for mr
0,bad. I cant download it.
0,"This does not apply to you if you only have one account on your Mac.  However if you run multiple users on the Mac read on, as you may have the problem described below.  A few years ago I documented installation problems H&R Block has when you run multi-user on Macs (which you should as a good security practice).  That review is here: [[ASIN:B002SR4S0Q H&R Block At Home 2009 Deluxe Federal + State + eFile [OLD VERSION]]]  Although it's better, there is still one problem that may be difficult or impossible for most non-techie sorts to figure out on their own.  It has to do with State program installation.  The problem and the solution is below:  I always install programs as root or Administrator to ensure file permissions are all OK.  (Indeed not doing so in past years caused problems with H&R Block).  Once installed (both the Federal and the State plug-in) I switch back to a normal non-privileged user to run all of my programs to include H&R Block.  The problem occurred when I wanted to start the state program. Although I had successfully downloaded and installed the state plug-in as root/Admin (in my case Maryland) when I tried to access it as my normal user it said I did not have a state program installed, and offered to let me buy one!  Here's how you have to solve the problem:  Sign back in as root/Admin.  Using the Finder navigate down to Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/H&RBlock 2011/Completed Updates/ then copy the file xx.TCstate11 where xx is the two-letter abbreviation for your state.  (In my case that was the MD.TCstate11 file).  Using Finder navigate to a shared directory that can be accessed by both users, e.g. Macintosh HD/Users/Shared and paste a copy of that file into that shared directory.  Go back to your normal user and sign in again.  Navigate to the Macintosh HD/Users/Shared directory and find your xx.TCstate11 file.  Using another Finder window navigate down to your home directory then the directory Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/H&RBlock 2011/Completed Updates/  (I had to create the Completed Updates directory in my normal user account as it did not exist yet).  Copy (or move) the xx.TCstate11 file into the directory above.  Double click that xx.TCstate11 file. A .dmg mountable file appears.  Double click on that too, and a state installer pop-up appears, which then redownloads your already-paid-for state program and inserts it as a plug-in to your normal user account library profile.  You're good to go.  This is annoying especially since I reported similar multi-user install problems in past years to H&R Block.  Apparently they still haven't gotten that bug worked out.  Sigh.  Anyway, this would be a five star review without that installation bug that affects some users, but two stars got deducted for not fixing a known flaw that has been known by them for two years.  (I called and wrote the company documenting it in addition to my Amazon reviews.)"
0,I purchased this for work. The conversion speed is so slow that it is not practical for me to use. I would not purchase this non-refundable software again.
1,"thank you Avast , my daily browser activities are safer due to Avast , moreover my computer and hard drives are securily protected"
1,"... and with all the options and little things included in avast! Free Antivirus, I almost feel like a thief. Almost."
1,Turbo tax did a wonderful job.  It works just as well as it has for several years. Very quick and accurate.
1,"I buy this as a download, get it immediately, and it works great. The product is easy to use, and has lots of help if you need it. I love TurboTax."
0,"It's not Office's fault, it's the download from Amazon that is the trouble. I paid around $120.00 for the software download, and and the product key was missing entirely.They sent me another key, but I asked for a refund since I did not activate it, and I got Office 365 much cheaper for 4 years through my school. But Amazon does not offer refunds for software downloads, ever. So I feel ripped off big time on this purchase. I will never ever download software such as this or games from Amazon again."
1,I've used TurboTax for years and it keeps getting better. It loaded my previous year's data with no problems and the interview process is simple and easy to understand.
0,I have been a Norton fan since 2005... before that I was a McAfee fan because Norton products hogged up computer performance and McAfee did not. Well this update takes us back to the bad old days... I should have read the forums outside of amazon before I made the purchase. Norton 2013 slows your PC down to a crawl and has add-on products popping out all over like legs on a spider. Horrible! I took my laptop back to factor with a full formate and reinstall just to get rid of it. Thankfully a friend told me about Microsofts Security Essentials which is a FREE Antivirus/Spyware that knits into your OS like ice melts into water. I have never ran so smoothly... tip: make sure you get all your important updates and if you have a mass of them like I did from doing a full format be sure to install the Windows updates in small chunks of about 10 at a time... its quicker than trying to get all the updates with one massive download and install. BEWARE OF NORTON Antivirus 2013 until they get the performance issues fixed... for better still do a format and reinstall using the FREE Microsoft Security Essentials from Microsoft.
1,"There is nothing better than avast for online protection.I protects against all malware, virus infection, Trojans or anything else yu may encounter while online"
1,LOVED THIS DOWNLOAD! HOW MUCH EASIER TO ORDER AND DOWNLOAD WITHOUT GOING STORE TO STORE LOOKING FOR BEST DEAL. I GOT LOWER PRICE THAN ANY STORE NEAR ME AND DIDNT LEAVE MY LIVING ROOM!! WILL ORDER AGAIN NEXT YEAR FOR SURE!!
1,I have used Turbo Tax for years. The step by step guide is very easy to follow. Highly recommend it.
0,"I started with Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2014 (which I really liked and had no trouble with) and recently updated to Internet Security 2015.  Three problems:<br /><br />1) If you listen to the email you get from Kaspersky telling you it's time to renew, and you follow the link to their Web site, you pay what appears to be full list price for it.  I did not find out before it was too late.  So, basically, being a good doobie and renewing cost me $10 additional (over the price Amazon charges for a new installation product).  This makes me feel cheated.  So definitely shop around before you renew.<br /><br />2) When you renew, it appears you lose whatever time is remaining on your license.  At least that was the case this time, when I updated from Anti-Virus 2014 to Internet Security 2015.  My old license had 30 days left on it, and the new one has 366 days.  I feel I should have gotten some credit for the remaining time on my existing license.  So, if you decide to update, you might want to wait until the last minute to do so.<br /><br />3) In Firefox anyway, the Safe Money feature disables all add-ons in the browser it opens (except Kaspersky's own add-ons) , and there appears to be no exception list or whitelist function to add add-ons that you need.  In my case, that means that my password manager (Roboform) will not work in the &#34;protected browser&#34; that Safe Money opens.  Which means that all of those long, obscure, different passwords that I have created for financial sites, the very sites that you are supposed to use ugly passwords for, are not accessible to me.<br /><br />People on the Web have commented on this.  Some folks have decided to just run Roboform outside of the &#34;protected browser&#34;, copy the login information from Roboform, and paste it into the &#34;protected browser&#34;.  That's unacceptable to me.  Others have said that there is a workaround available in Chrome.  I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />I ended up having to disable Safe Money.<br /><br />If there IS in fact a whitelist for add-ons in Safe Money, please point out to me how to get to it.  The Web doesn't seem to know.<br /><br />It's also fair for me to point out that Kaspersky Internet Security does have other protection features, such as Anti-Banner and Anti-Spam, that I have enabled but I don't have enough time with them to comment on how well they work.  The only gripes I have so far are the ones I listed above.  I will update my review once I've lived with the product for a while.ey.<br /><br />If there IS in fact a whitelist for add-ons in Safe Money, please point out to me how to get to it.

1,I've had ESET Smart Security for about a month and there has been no problems and doesn't nag me to buy something else.  It was  pretty smooth installation and I really like that.
1,Love the money protection app in here to keep Paypal and bank accounts safe.
1,Excellent program.  Have used it every year.
1,"I had been a TurboTax user for many, many years. When Intuit introduced its ridiculous new pricing scheme, I tried H&R Block. (My return is simple enough but I do own a home and had capital gains this year - requiring a big upgrade under the new TurboTax scheme.) I'm glad I broke the (unnecessary) dependence on TurboTax. I found the interactive guide through the return as good or better than TurboTax - with fewer promotions for other (Intuit) products. My daughter used H&R Block, and the version also guided her through her at-home office expenses. E-filing for me and my daughter were covered by the basic price.    If H&R Block doesn't try the same price-gouging tactic in the future, it has me for an annual renewal."
0,"Intuit software is consistently buggy. I've had many issues with Quickbooks. This time, after spending hours using Turbotax, the software can no longer open my file, with a cryptic Error 604. In addition, I noticed that when importing 1099-INT information from my bank, it didn't include all of my accounts! It's incredible that the &#34;leader&#34; in tax preparation software could release such an awful product."
1,Excellent tax software prep.
0,I had to removed because it dint work to my expectation to much spyware and virus got into my computer due to your software
1,"As usual, a decent program that does what I need.  My one complaint is that is is slightly different than Quicken for Windows, which I had been using, and it is not quite as simple. Some one step operations take 2 steps on the Mac version.  But a huge positive was that the Quicken techs took my windows file and converted it to a Mac file for me...for no charge. A big and pleasant surprise.  Also, technical assistance was verty helpful in walking me through some of the differences."
1,Another year.  Another new great version of Quicken.
1,Quickbooks has made it easy for me to manage all of my bookkeeping myself. I can enter in all my own transactions and run reports to better understand my business. I have used it for over 15 years.
1,I just purchased it about 45 minutes ago.  It took less than 10 minutes to download and I am already using it to continue writing my novel.  I will also be using it for school papers.  Love it!
1,best ever
0,"[[ASIN:B002VPE3FU TurboTax Premier Federal  + State 2009 + efile [DOWNLOAD]]]    I have found a bug in the software that won't let me delete a dependent after starting the Dependent Care Expenses module.  The Dependent Care Expenses Summary page has a delete button next to the dependents, but it does nothing.  I have been waiting in a chat window with Technical Services for 1 hour and counting with no response!!  No, wait...disconnected from Tech services after 90 minutes!"
0,This product did not work at all my wife and I could not get it downloaded. We had to go to Walmart and buy another one. I would like my money back but that is not the problem. The fact that it did not work is.
1,"Works great.  Stops evil viruses before they can attack.  Great product and IT'S FREE.  Tried paid antivirus and they did not work as well.  Did I mention, it's free?"
1,"It didn't work at first on either my Asus Notebook or PC desktop - there a compatilibity issue it seemed regarding the internet. But MAN, their phone help is really impressive, I have to say. They told me how to configure my computer or Kaspersky or Firefox or Eudora - I forget now which or what, but all I can say is they were kind and patient and knowledgeable, and got me through both of my issues. And I loved the survey at the end: one question: helped or didn't help? And then a soft voice says: &#34;Thank you, goodbye&#34; Anyway, Kasp. has always been our household's choice, and with this first-time hiccup, they didn't disappoint."
1,Excellent MIDI interface.
1,"I had been using free avast for 2 years before I switched to Internet security. I am glad I did cause I enjoy it a lot. It is nonintrusive and user friendly. Avast decides on actions to take on its own most of the time and is perfect for those who are not good with computers. I like its software updater feature when It reminds to update important software like Java. Also avast provides a &#34;SafeZone&#34; to protect your online banking or other important activities in the internet. Avast prevents access to malicious or suspicious websites which I find extremely useful. To sum up. the product is great and hassle free, never had a problem with it in 4 years."
0,"I use Windows 7 Professional edition and this software would not install.  The vendor offered suggestions but nothing worked. I was ready to give up on it.  I recently bought a Fujitsu scanner from Amazon and that software would not install either.  I wound up installing Windows Virtual PC and an XP operating system on my Windows 7 machine.  This allows my computer to act like it's running XP and both software products install OK there.  The Virtual PC and XP software were free from Microsoft but be prepared for a couple of days of labor.  The training is very good, once you get it to run."
1,I have been using this software for several years now (TaxCut & now HR Block). It is a very easy program to use for those with simple to medium types of returns.
0,"I have been a Quicken user for many, many years, almost since its inception. I continually updated my Quicken for Windows every other year. When I went to the OS platform, I maintained a Windows PC just for Quicken because I didn't like Quicken Essentials for MAC. I finally made the transition but wasn't satisfied. When the new Quicken for MAC came out I was psyched to finally restore all the great usability from my previous Quicken experience. I have been disappointed. Data entry doesn't work the same. Account reconciliation is deathly slow and doesn't work the same. It is certainly not as good as the PC product. I will not give up on Quicken for MAC but my initial reaction is...blah, not what I hoped for or expected."
1,"I was able to snag a copy of this when it was a lightning deal  + use a $8 coupon that came with my download of Turbo Tax, for a grand total of less than $17. Installation was a breeze, and unlike my experience with the program a few years ago, it ran quietly and quickly in the background. It is nice and affordable addition to my laptop, which I am trying my best to squeeze another few years from. If you are lucky enough to buy it when it is momentarily on sale, it is a steal. If you buy it for full (Amazon) price, it is still a steady workhorse and a grade A product."
1,GREAT BETTER THAN NORTON AND MCAFEE
0,"As noted in the first post, if you have any other version of Quicken, you will end up shilling out another $30 or more to open your file via an upgrade.  I am a mobilized Army soldier away from home.  When my laptop gave out and I replaced it, I restored my data files to the new laptop.  As I don't have access to my original software (at my house) I thought I would just go ahead and buy the starter version (which has everything I need) to use with my .QDF file.  Wrong!  The starter version won't open or read my \\""deluxe\\"" version file.  Hence, another $30 spent on the \\""upgrade\\"".  Now I know why Quicken was \\""free\\"" when MS Money discontinued their software...  I am very disappointed in this company and feel totally taken advantage of."
1,Was rated highly by CR; but our IT department says that Kaspersky is better product at scanning.
1,"If possible I would reward YourSafetynet with 10 stars, as I've only just installed the program and I don't yet know what we'll come up against. But so far I think it's fantastic, exactly what I was looking for! YourSafetynet is just the filter you need for protecting your children from all the malicious and risky websites that you can discover online. You are also able to prevent computer addiction with this program. One advantage is that you can set up all of the filters exactly as you wish.<br /><br />See the video instruction on YouTube<br /><br />Some virus scanners provide basic web filter functionality. This functionality may conflict with YourSafetynet. Disable these potentially conflicting features of your virus scanner. This is also recommended by the YourSafetynet installer during installation."
1,"I am glad I purchased Norton its the best choice I have made for my pc , this product is grrrrrrreeeeeaaaaatttttt !!!!!!"
1,This is one piece of software you cannot be without if you like to edit your photos. A must for any studio artist.
1,Have used it for years.  Best way to do your own taxes. Step by step instructions makes it easy to follow.
1,"my pc works has always worked well as long as norton is installed. once it is past the expiry date, which happened to me twice before and ive had to reinstall windows, had some really really malicious hard to remove stuff attach to my hdd.<br /><br />ive tried other antivirus programs and there was always too much bloatware, OR some form of virus of spyware or trojan or some such item has afflicted my pc.<br /><br />some would say windows security essentials is all u need. but that is not my experience either.<br /><br />in short this programme for me has apparently been essential, with it installed, pc runs fine, smooth, no hitches.<br /><br />when it expires and i use another program (a trial version), well it costs me money and time."
0,TurboTax makes a great product and then cripples it by removing a key feature in the Deluxe edition so that you have to buy the Premier edition. Then their advocate tells you they are doing you a favor because people were confused last year and they labored over this decision for 5 years before deciding to screw the customer.. Do you remember a few years ago when they removed the ability to print more than one tax return? Great product; sleazy company trying to maximize profit.
1,This was a great purchase.. love getting the triple pack since we have desktop and laptop. Now I can work from home and email to school/work. I also love the download instead of the disk. Saves money and storage room.
1,"Very reliable. When set up correctly (disable the automatic updates) it runs in the background w/o slowing computer speed.<br /><br />With automatic updates it unfortunately loads McAfee whenever Adobe updates, and this is usually a problem.  (The problem is with Adobe and its insistence on automatically adding McAffee to your system).<br /><br />Great program.  Highly recommended."
0,"I need to cancel it, order by mystake"
0,"It's not very user-friendly. I thought I would find a good full production editing software after using after effects for small parts, and get some nice titles as well, but the titles are cheesy and the program is just annoying to work with. I suggest paying more for Adobe's software or simply using iMovie/Windows Movie Maker. After Effects and Premier are the best software I have ever used, once you learn how to use them."
1,"We've run our business with Quick Books Pro since 2003. The flexibility and power combined meet all of our needs - manufacturing, sales, compliance! Big or small, this product will handle it all so you don't have to worry about your books and can focus on making your business successful."
1,1. Can't beat this price.<br />2. Download and installation was fast and easy.<br />3. What more can I say!
1,"I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT, BUT I DO HANDLE ALL OF OUR COMPANIES AR AND AP NEEDS ALONG WITH THE OWNERS PERSONNEL BILLS WITHOUT QUICKBOOKS I WOULD BE LOST.<br />WE STILL ARE OLD SCHOOL AND LIKE IT THAT WAY BUT WITHOUT QUICKBOOK 2012 I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF OUR CUSTOMERS BILLS AND PAYMENTS.  I ALSO LOVE THE NOTE SECTION, I CAN REMIND OUR CONTRACTORS AND ARCHITECTS WHAT WAS SAID ON ANY GIVEN DAY WHEN IT COMES TO BILLING AND OR JOB TIME LINE."
1,"It does what it's supposed to do, but Quicken Essentials was just fine also."
1,"I could not do my finances without Quicken, I update my<br />Quicken every two years."
1,Been using Avast for a few years. It is great. It is free. It seems to catch everything that tries to get in.
0,"Even with this software, my computer has many problems.  Their service is non-existent. Once service is over, I am looking for other options.    I bought this software based upon review posted on one site. It looks like it was paid site.  I won't rely on reviews unless from reputed firms like pcmag or cnet."
0,Had to call factory support.<br />They were not helpfull in resolving my issue.<br />I figured it out on my own.
1,"I haven't had any problem with the avast antivirus, I would purchase the product if I had the money for full protection but the protection I get for free has been very good. It is actually not a bad price for the full protection and works well. I just can't get it right now."
1,"Works well, took a long time to download was the only problem with DSL, but it worked just like I wanted it to do.."
0,"Useless, Dont bother. It looks like a bunch of clipart that you can print on fabric to create tiny little purses.  Even the pictures are horrible."
1,"I am sure it is a great book, but think twice about learning Tagalog. You really don't need it in the Philippines. Most Americans who live there get by with English and live great lives."
1,Surprisingly effective and free too!
1,"I can certainly empathize with those reviewers who struggled with the QB 2010 download and installation.  I'm pleased to report that I was able to download the softward, install it, go through the pesky online registration screens and get 3 sets of data converted in about an hour.  Yes, the 'constant sell' screens are annoying - but where in your life are you not being advertised to?"
1,"I payed my tax preparer to process my 2013 tax return, but I also used Turbo Tax to check it on my own. Turbo Tax got me more than $5000 in total on my returns. My returns were several pages thicker and more thoroughly done, than those prepared by my experienced tax preparer."
0,This has the potential of being a very good program.<br />However every time I want to change to another binder<br />I have to use task manager to close the program and<br />start all over again. You can't just switch binders.<br />You can't even close the program with out using task<br />manager. It is very frustrating to say the least.<br />Getting Items from your documents folders is very<br />labor intensive. You can't import a folder unless you<br />only want to have one folder per binder.  Most of the<br />Items I am trying to move are scanned documents.<br />It would be nice to just be able to scan them into the<br />binders instead of into documents folders first
0,"This doesn't work! Wasted $9.99 for who knows what was downloaded on my Mac that I now have to find and strip back off!!!  Amazon, you should have some due diligence before applying your brand on the downloader!!!!"
1,"Outstanding for home use.  If a student, look for deals to get a professional or enterprise version through your institution.  The home version lacks a lot of deep development, analytic, and programming functionality that you may find useful in your education and career."
0,"why is it when I print my state returns ,the forms have DO NOT FILE WRITTEN ON THEM? I NEED TO SEND THEM TO THE IRS."
0,"Two months of crashes, update failures, beta type programing made me regret upgading from 2011 to this version.  I paid $60 for a giant mistake that deletes your old program and alters your data making it unusable except on this version.  Save your money!!"
1,Works like a charm. Easy to use. I have a Windows 7 machine. No problems whatsoever.
1,"This is working great on my Android tablet.  I have been using Norton security products for a long time and they have always done a great job.  There are many free AV utilities out there now but I don't know about their reliability.  It would seem without any income they couldn't put much into research to analyze the latest threats.  A security product like this is only as good as it's latest definitions so I will likely stay with a paid product.  I would not however pay what the Symantec list price is though ($29.99), I got it here on Amazon for a third of that.  Because of Symantec's high list price I am deducting one star from my rating."
0,"Terrible, crashes constantly despite numerous re-installs and troubleshooting."
0,"I don't know why, but when Quicken syncs to my bank, anytime checks I have entered will show as cleared and then it will duplicate it and enter it a second time.  Last time I synced it, it showed me being over $800.00 to the negative, but when I went through and sorted out all the duplicates, it was over $500.00 in the positive.  I used to use MS Money and never had that issue but had to switch to Quicken because they discontinued Money.  I am debating buying the latest version but don't want to waste money on it if it isn't going to work any better."
0,Not only did i install it I waited all day whilst it scanned! a whole day!!! Then once i finally found the few pictures i was looking for it asked for the activation code so I entered it and NO not valid. So i thought must be confusion went to purchase and tried to charge me an additional 38.95GBP!!!!!!!! Trying to contact the supplier and manufacturer is even harder! if you ever consider using this DONT!
1,For being free I feel this is very adequate for our needs. I would recommend this to everyone that needs antivirus.
1,Good package in Internet security keeps always clear from virus threats. Recommend to friends to get these for their pc's
1,works great
1,"TT Business is a great product for my simple trusts, estate tax returns and for a Sub-s business.  The download worked as advertized.  I have DSL for internet but the download took significantly less time than predicted.  Great software purchased from a company that has mastered product delivery!"
1,"And does the job!  I have used Turbo Tax AND gone to a CPA before and the Turbo Tax was spot on!  So now I just use it!  Wish it e-filed the State too, but at least it did it and I could mail.  E-filed the Fed!<br /><br />Easy to download, easy to use and easy to file!  Have used for several years and will keep using!"
0,Very disappointing...not nearly has helpful as Essentials !
1,"Been using AVAST for years and have installed it on many friends computers. I much prefer it over any other antivirus program. I previously had Norton as well as McAfee and  they don't even come close! It has never failed to catch any malware, etc., and I'm using the free version, not even the more powerful versions that come at a price."
1,"After the long download time, you have to go to Adobe's website to validate. I didn't know this until after I called Amazon when getting started wasn't happening. If you have a .edu email address, use that so you will get validated immediately. If you don't have one, I've read that it takes longer. Product is expensive for even a student/teacher edition. But it could be worse."
1,"I really like the cloud drive, it is easy to upload and download from.. Setup is simple."
1,its a very good software for free. pay the full price and get an awesome protection
1,"Quicken is Quicken!  What can I say.  The program does a great job of what was needed for tracking, accounting, bank accounts, etc."
1,Read the product detail!!!  State will e-file ONLY if you purchase that feature independently. The title of the product is misleading.  I purchased this 17 hours ago and the price has dropped by $4.00...lol.
1,Amazon lets you download! Awesome!! this was great software for beginners and experts + you can download it from AMAZON.
0,Be prepared to manually enter last year's data:<br /><br />This software does not sync with the online version.<br />The online version of this software does not allow you to export last year's data to a filetype that this software will import.
1,"I've used Avast! for my home PC and Android phone for years without issue or complaint.  Takes up fewer resources and has more frequent updates than a lot of the other big-name products, and has better features than most."
1,I've used this software before and it had everything that I needed to have for personal use and small business use.
1,Quickbooks is the standard.  I stay organized and I confidently know my business is financial organized when it comes to Quickbooks.
1,I've used TurboTax Many times in the past so I was not surprised with the ease of use and overall great functionality.  I will definately use it again..
1,"I always buy Norton for my home PC.  Our office uses McAfee, but I prefer Norton."
0,"I bought this software and but for some reason I was unable to install it. I contacted their tech support to get some help but have only received an automatic response telling me that they have received my email. I have tried to contact their customer support numerous times with no response whatsoever. After one month of trying to make contact with seller to resolve the issue I gave up and asked the seller to give me my money back, which they refuse to do. Simply put; this is a fraud."
1,worked great
0,"Quicken 2011, though panned by some, is a good product if your need isn't extensive. Since I don't use many of the functions of the program, I will not hold it against them.<br /><br />For those of you who do your bank statements online, I think it's good. The only beef I have with them--is what I've always had a beef with them about--that downloading your information online doesn't always work. Sometimes--especially for my credit card--it will tell me that it was unable to do anything and that it is on their end, and there's nothing I can do about it. Supposedly, they are working on the problem. Well, since this problem has been with their program for a long time now, they aren't working too hard on it. (Not sure of the exact wording, but that's the gist of it.)<br />So, I have to wipe the account out and start all over again, until it does it the next time."
1,this is better than any that I have tried
1,I really liked this product of quicken it has come a long way from when they first started. However the only complaint I have is that it doesn't recognize th password I put in so I can't get back into my quicken file.  What do I do now?
0,Kinda limited free version always wants you to buy paid version cannot tell any difference after running CCleaner
0,Took it off my machine.  To many ads and other useless junk.  I ran it for about a month.
1,"I just bought my first MacBook Pro. I have been a PC user my whole life, and my HP Pavilion screen pooped out (5yrs old) and my husband said, you should just buy a MacBook because you have an iPad and iPhone and you can have everything connected. Plus my college uses Windows applications and I needed something that would be compatible with school. I have seen a lot of my classmates get their work screwed up, or not able to do a presentation because of Mac stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice transition for me because I am not fully use to a Mac yet, so it is nice to use something familiar."
1,Good price.  Product works perfectly.
1,I was late filing and this had no issues. You can't efile but mailing it in is no big deal.
1,"This program is much better then I expected! It is fairly easy to use, has tons of options that allow you to edit/make a cover/letter with ease. Better then all the other programs I have tried!"

0,"I bought this Norton to use on my new laptop to protect it since I use it mostly for school and business.<br />I have been scanning and updating it normally and was happy that it indicated which sites were safe or not, etc.<br />However, I noticed it that my computer slowed down and was crashing, freezing, and having trouble opening folders/browsers, etc. This is a brand new laptop and very fast!<br />So, after scanning with Norton several times and running full scans, I decided to try Microsoft scan to see if it would detect anything.<br />It caught the Exploit:Win32/CVE-2010-2890 which is a malware that wasn't detected by Norton and was removed PARTIALLY by the Microsoft scanner. I don't know how I got it, maybe watching videos on youtube or facebook or hulu, who knows,or from browsing unsafe sites (NOT obvious unsafe sites!)that Norton did NOT detect as unsafe.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with this and don't know how to remove it! I'll probably have to re-install Windows 7 again!"
0,"Did fine for doing the taxes. It's obvious though that the product is being milked for every possible revenue stream. The grabs for money along the way to doing the taxes are obvious, distracting and annoying. Really... I just want to do my taxes, store my data locally and be on my way."
0,Would not load
1,I love it!!
1,"This is bought for my daughter to learn to type.  I use it to increase my speed.  There are games and lessons.  I like the down load, since my daughter has a netbook, and I did not want to have to keep a CD in the computer.  Works great."
0,"I am not sure that you can update for the three user version for $25.00. I suspect that this will only be to upgrade the installation on one PC. If you have NIS 2012 on 3 PCs, it will end up costing $75.00 - far more than this offer. Can anyone confirm or correct this?"
1,I've been using TurboTax for many years.  It's user friendly and guides you through all the deductions step by step if needed. You can also skip the areas you are not interested in saving time and still getting your maximum deductions.
0,"I have Streets and Trips 2010, and wanted updated information. 2013 does not work, trip planner puts in side trips that are unnecessary. So far Microsoft &#34;help&#34; has been unhelpful. So I went back to using 2010, thankfully I did not let the download destroy that version. A bad download is a waste of money."
1,My system runs very smooth using avast free antivirus service. It is such a good feeling not having to worry.
1,I have used Avast for the last 10 years and have never had an intrusion or virus problem that the software did not catch.
1,Amazon never ceases to amaze me with the products they produce. Thanks for everything.
0,This new version is nothing to write home about.  It really is no different for me as a business user except I am no longer able to email invoices because I can't use Outlook express to do it.  At least the version I have and I haven't been able to update only Outlook express.  My understanding I will have to update my complete bundle of OFFICE software.  This new Quicken has actually made my job harder and I have taken a step back now that I have to print and mail all my invoices.  Bad move folks!!
1,Seems OK so far
1,"After being almost put off by the one star reviews, I counted the 4 & 5 star reviews vs the one stars.  The  greater than 2 to 1 majority won.     The download was easy and smooth. Quicken 2015 looks amost the same as my old Quicken 2012, and that is a good thing - I would have kept 2012 a lot longer if I had that option (one of the biggest complaints of the one stars was the forced upgrade and I agree with them on that score)    I do not use all the features of Quicken, but the ones I use are working perfectly (bank accounts, credit cards, stock and mutual fund tracking)  I also like the running account of net worth and the home page charts.    Also like the Amazon price which is $35 less than Intuit wanted in a mailer they sent me offering $10 off a price of $75 for a loyal user.    HINT:  After restarting following a successful download I was asked for the \\""password vault\\"" password. After I entered it, Quicken would not recognize the backup file to update the 2015 version.  Restarted again and cancelled the request for the \\""password vault\\"" password, and then Quicken recognized the backup file, and all has been well since then.    (This review written by Bun's husband)"
1,"OK, so I got the notice that of the end of support for 2011, then saw the reviews ... and almost didn't pull the trigger to upgrade. I have been a user for many, many years, and thought I was doing a good job with Quicken and my accounts.<br /><br />v2014 had some interesting things occur with the upgrade. (note this was USER ERROR!)<br /><br />When I converted the previous QDATA file, there was a new section of accounts called &#34;Separate&#34; ... which had a value shown of funds.  I went into it, and found a long list of hidden accounts, and some with funds in them!  In the past, I had apparently hidden the accounts and never moved the funds out of them.  One such account was the &#34;household items&#34; (Quicken Home Inventory) that I forgot I had ever tried!!  Closing these accounts was difficult, as there were &#34;transactions&#34; in them ... so I reinstalled the Q2011 and closed them there.  Then converted again ...<br /><br />In the end, not sure why &#34;separate&#34; is still showing - and kind of annoying really.  Would prefer to not have it show at all ...<br /><br />Otherwise, looks like the same Quicken ..."
1,no problems so far! Seems to be doing a good job !Does a great job on letting us know whats going on
0,More basic than anything you can do on Microsoft Word. Not worth spending the money when you can do a better job yourself.
0,"Largely straight forward product that makes completing my personal and small business taxes quite manageable. I like the electronic filing feature for federal and state. Disappointed that the program sometimes doesn't display calculations such as estimated tax amounts paid which caused me a penalty one year because it had entered it without displaying the amount in another part of a form and then I entered it again. After using the program for 15 years I find that it doesn't carry forward information on vehicular mileage which is important when disposing of a vehicle, creating a lot of work in finding previous years' info. Too bad current version can't open a previous year's return, even in just viewing mode."
1,"Replace 360 version with Security version and feel protected on my smart phone, tablet, and laptops."
1,thanks
0,DO NOT PURCHASE THE DOWNLOADABLE VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT!!!! IT DOES NOT RUN ON WINDOWS 7.  I HAD TO UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL TWICE AND STILL THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT RUN PROPERLY.  AVOID!
0,"Purchased this version and did not use, wasted money this tax season . . ."
0,This product is okay. I bought a week ago and already mastered most of it. My problem with it is that the pictures are sometimes hard to understand what they are. Other than that the program is okay but for the price it should be a little better. I gave it three out of 5 stars.
1,"Moved form turbotax to taxcut (now hrblock) because of a discount.  Both are excellent, but hrb looks to be cheaper, with good integration with turbo tax."
1,The 2013 software has many nice features over the 2007 version but take some time to get know where they are and how to use them.
0,"I've used Kaspersky Anti-Virus for a couple years now, but will not be renewing beyond my most recent subscription.  For the past week, my computer usage has been repeatedly interrupted by harassing reminders to renew, which has more than once pulled me out of processor-intensive applications and resulted in considerable loss of time while the system memory thrashed; said pestering continues past the expiry date.  This sort of programmatic behavior is both unprofessional and a liability, and in my opinion, absolutely not worth paying money for.    As for general product quality, Kaspersky is to my understanding one of the heavier duty AV apps out there, and though they've improved their user interface recently, it is still rather slow and bloated.  This shouldn't pose a serious issue if you've a high-powered machine or are only running lighter apps.  It's also worth noting that my uninstall process has been stuck for almost an hour so far, and won't even cancel.  Not the first time I've had a paid anti-virus program \\""encounter difficulties\\"" uninstalling (other time was Norton)...ironically, is almost like being infected with a virus.    On the other hand, nagware like Avast and AVG don't strike me as appealing choices either, so am probably just going to stick with something free and unobtrusive like Microsoft Security Essentials."
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax for years. I can file my taxes in less than an hour. With E-file, I usually have my refund in less than two weeks. Because I use Turbo Tax from year to year, I don't have to enter much data. It all transfers from the previous year. I can download W2 information as well.<br /><br />Love Turbo Tax."
0,"The procedure to view &#34;Loan Details&#34; and the ability to set up accounts to &#34;Lend&#34; money, has drastically changed (for the worse) from 2012 to 2015.  In addition, 2015 lost the ability to designate a specific category for the interest, at the time of payment.  More, or less, forced to upgrade to 2015, or lose the ability to download from financial institutions.  I had rather pay the upgrade fee and still be allowed to use 2012, renewing all it's capabilities, for the same amount of time as 2015 is allowed.......I would have given 2012 a five star rating.  If customer service were a priority for this company, they could make this happen, by renewing 2012 for a fee, or, FIX 2015, to where it's good for both.....&#34;Lender and Borrower&#34;."
1,"After fighting with McAfee until I nearly threw out my computer, Avast is a dream to use, is very user friendly  for loading new programs and I love it.  I've been using Avast now for several years and have not experienced any virus problems since I started using it."
1,I've been using Norton 360 for the third straight year and haven't had ANY problems in that time.  This program also keeps your computer tuned up and carefree.  Also doesn't slow the computer down as earlier versions did.  Highly recommended.
1,I have used the Checkbook for a long time and love it. I used to write all my entries in my register by hand and it just got to be too much. Now I just type them in and it calculates the balance for me. If I accidentally enter something twice I can just delete one. I have A LOT fewer errors in my checkbook now. When it comes time to balance my checkbook it is literally just checking off the items and a couple clicks and it's done. Couldn't be easier. AND when I got a new computer they were really great about sending me the link again. I highly recommend this.
1,"Well I realy couldn't say, because I couldn't get the thing to download."
0,"I installed the product from amazon downloader successful to my Macbook.  It runs fine on my admin account. However, it will not run on my childs account with permission granted."
0,Worst I ever used. Had to call the company and get my money back. Norton had a habit of adding all kinds of JUNK to my computer every time I scanned for a virus.
1,"Obviously, the tax code is confusing and TurboTax does an excellent job at simplifying requirements. In addition, TurboTax helps you get organized, i.e. Income sources, Deductions and Tax Credits.  However, the cashless sale of stock options does need work, specifically distinguishing the type of sales that can occur; and other requirements associated with the sale of equity assets."
1,This worked out great QB's stated in an email that they were going to give a great price on updating so I would not lose the ability to download from the bank. Their price well over $300....
0,i can't uninstall this piece of s***.
0,Up until now I have been happy with Amazon and their products. I purchased the Serif Photo projects  3-22-2013 and most of the choices do not even work you cannot edit any of the photos or remove red eye you can't resize and every time you click on a choice they want you to purchase part of it in order for it to work.  I paid $20.55 for it and the very next day I found it on amazon for<br />$4.48 now that is ripping people off.<br />It is not even worth the $4.48 not to mention $20.25 It does not work properly with windows 7 so this is just trash to me.<br />You can't even return these digital products even if they do not work on your computer properly.
0,"The software was good, however they charge another $20 to file State return.  Software is priced high enough without paying for State return."
1,Great Product!
0,Saturday; Norton 360 downloaded an upgrade.  That was the last time it worked.<br /><br />When I could not get it to work; I downloaded Norton 360 2013.<br /><br />It would neither install or work.  Tech support (their term; not mine) was no help.<br /><br />I would give it less than one star if I could.  Perfect gift for April Fools Day.<br /><br />I did get good advice from their support group.  Buy Webroot.  Installed with no problem and worked without having to reboot.<br /><br />It is also very fast.
0,The sorting time when entering as new transaction while reconciling takes forever.  I have been trying to reconcile my checking account for a few hours because I can't get the sort complete. It takes several minutes every time a new transaction is entered. In reconcile mode. Long time user of Quicken for all my financial data. I wish I had waited until later to upgrade.
1,"Best reviewing for Step 1 and related tests for Medical School!!!  Beyond the simple flash card and memorization, Memorang allows your self to challenge your memory, which means better and faster retention.  Also for entering you own cards as well.<br /><br />New updates to the program coming all the time, Android/Iphone/Ipad Apps for FREE, to access you cards.<br /><br />It's AWESOME!!!"
0,"Converted from 2012 same version and it auto entered all skipped transactions changing ending balance in excess of -$25,000. After removing all uncleared 'skipped' transactions and verified correct data then proceeded to enter transactions only to discover that entering a transaction in the register, miscalculates the remaining balance (ie. $1094.48 balance less transaction of $328.58 shows negative $1405.52 remaining.) WTF is that about?<br />Not worth spending hours on the phone to with a company only proving support Monday through Friday, 5 AM to 5 PM, Pacific Time.<br />Removing and returning. Will continue to use ver 2012.  Also, does not work with Windows XP 64-bit edition."
1,"What can I say, It's Norton and it works. I have been using Norton for years and I have no intention of using anything else. They have been securing my internet forever. I recommend it."
0,"The 2014 edition seems to have severe issues with basic importing of data.  After importing it, it refused to work at all with 3 major institutions, and signed us up for a premier 'service' with one institution that suddenly made the institution bill us several dollars each month for the luxury of  having quicken connect to it.<br />Send in log files to Quicken, which they 'troubleshot' specifically for the only institution that was already working...and costing extra dollars.  This was the only institution NOT mentioned in the complaint.  They tried again; and got 1 of the three institutions suddenly working...without doing any kind of patching to the software and without me doing anything....gives me the ultra-creepy feeling that they either were able to remote into the machine while I was sleeping or have direct access to my banking information.<br />I requested a refund 3 weeks ago and still have not received any confirmation or money returned."
1,My loves this program and loves the positive feedback.  I learned to type with the adult version years ago and the skills I learned I still use today.  I had purchased 2 programs before and I had taken 2 college typing classes and could not pick up typing.  This program changed everything for me.  I highly recommend this program.
0,"I find the print difficult to see.  If I enlarge the font, then additional menus are bigger than the screen and I cannot close the item.  I would  like to be able to print with gridlines.  I had to change because I bought a new computer with windows 8 and was told I had to buy15 as my 13 program  is not compatable.  I also don;'t like the way bills are displayed."
0,"Upgraded from Quicken 2012 to Quicken 2015.<br /><br />Have been a Quicken user for 15 years.<br /><br />Not impressed. Runs very slow, do not see any improvements.<br />What changed for the better in three years?<br />Still would always recommend quicken to anyone to managed your personal money & budget."
1,"I bought this product to watch my Blu Ray movies on my PC.<br />For this and almost any other video and audio format it works great.<br /><br />I found only one point of improvement that I would recommend for the Corel people.<br />Please allow this product to work in a virtual environment.<br />I use VMware's Workstation and wanted the blue ray to operate in Windows 7's Virtual Machine... oops the program says \\""NO CAN DO\\""... I think it is somewhere near Kathmandu ??? ;)<br /><br />apart from that one little glitch I highly recommend this application to play your Blu Rays, DVD's, VCD, mpeg etc..."
0,i downloaded it to use with my checksoft program and it does not work saying it is out of date.
1,"Easy, organized way to do taxes. Originally I was not willing to spend the extra for the outlandish increase in product line required to fulfill the same tasks as I did last year, however TT made good and gave a coupon to previous buyers.  I'll wait to see how bad the increase is next year before committing to buy again"
1,"Works just fine, not disappointed at all. Better than the competition mcaffe. I suggest everyone try it for their homecomputers."
1,"Pros: I tried this after using Kaspersky for about 4 years. I'm glad I switched. It uses very little resources, and scans relatively quickly. I don't even know it's there. After a month of use, I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Con: The only one is that it doesn't seem to have a quick way to disable it-such as when gaming. Not really a con though since it's resource usage is so low to begin with."
1,"I have being using TurboTax since 2009, I like the simplicity of filing your taxes, very user friendly and how accurate it is. Have used it every year and never had a problem with the IRS."
1,as expected
1,Quicken has been a brand new program for me to learn. For a single person business and tax info it is very good.  It has capabilities for setting up budgets and other way to keep info.  As you explore this program you will find all kinds of things you can do.
1,Great product
1,Hard to find some options to make it work smoothly on my system.
1,"I've been stressing over the need to upgrade ever since I started reading the 2014 reviews. I was running 2011, so time was up for me. I waited until the last minute and bit the bullet today. I've really become dependent on Quicken to manage my numerous financial accounts e.g. retirement, personal finance, assets etc. I thought back to when my bank changed brands a couple of years ago and the grief I went through to get my accounts converted - hours on the phone with Intuit and my bank to get thing resolved.<br /><br />Well, I have to say that the upgrade came off without a glitch. I'm running Windows XP and received release 5, which was updated to release 7 as soon as the conversion was complete. The data transition was smooth and everything came up just like before. The only difference I've noticed so far is that I was never able to get my wife's 401k to update automatically in 2011 and was thrilled to see it update for the first time. Though I'm a loyal Amazon customer (and vendor), I downloaded directly from Intuit (50% off retail) just to make sure I received the latest version. Looks like I didn't, but it all came out in the wash. Just wanted to make the point that not every upgrade ends in failure."
1,"It's much more thorough than freeware solutions, and I actually think it does a pretty decent job. However, the memory footprint is fairly substantial, and I find that the software is lacking in features (previous versions felt more full-featured to me)."
1,"I was told by other users that it was the best, and I'm not disappointed. It is everything it is said to be."
0,"The only reason I upgraded from 2010 was because they threaten that they will no longer support communication with the banks for 2010. I see nothing in the upgrade that was a big enough benefit to make up for the headaches. I am not change averse - I work for a software company and love technology, but I have had ONLY bad experiences in the past with their upgrades and this in no exception. I have spent literally hours trying to get my accounts back in order. Even their online support guy gave up and still couldn't get my transactions to download. It has dropped all my passwords, and I have transactions hanging in limbo. I am so frustrated [CAN YOU TELL!] that they would release a product that is so clearly not ready for GA. I think it is time to look at a competitor's product. Intuit!Do you read your customers' reviews? Try Googling \\""I hate Quicken 2013\\"" and see how many hits you get!"
1,"Before anyone lets themselves get as upset as I was over the Turbo Tax changes, I would strongly suggest that you place a call to Intuit's customer service line. Believe me I was extremely upset over their software changes and I placed a call to Intuit intending on strongly voicing my displeasure. However, by the time the call ended, I immediately decided to remain a loyal Turbo Tax customer. Not only did they address my issue to my satisfaction, they took full responsibility for their error and sincerely apologized for the issue.<br /> I am retired from GE where I held a Direct of Service position. I have considerable experience in Customer satisfaction and am very capable of identifying the difference between a standard boiler plate apology message verse a sincere effort to &#34;make the situation right&#34; and Intuit truly did make it right in my case. Again, I suggest that you place a call to Intuit and you be pleasantly surprised with the results."
0,Failed to read customer reviews off site and now paying the price. Software initially failed to download TWICE. On the third go around it began to roll back the software (computer speak for 'stall') and failed to install the third and my final attempt.
0,"I'm thinking of redoing my basement and thought this looked like a good product to use to get some ideas.  I have no CAD or construction experience, so I was just looking for something pretty easy to use get design ideas.  The product does exactly what it says it will, which is fine but a bit limited.  If you want to take a picture of a room and see what it would look like with a new color of paint, it's good for that.    However, if you want to add any additional design elements, like moldings or other additional items, your pretty much out of luck. Very little is included with the package,a few TV's and such, but no furniture. You can import images, colors and textures, but the level of difficulty goes up quite a bit if you want to do that.  Does seem to have more exterior and landscape elements than interior ones, though I didn't look too hard at those as I'm doing an interior project.    Suffice to say it is not enough to get very far planning any kind of remodel.  Still, if all you are trying to do is change the color of your walls or house, it's not a bad tool for playing \\""what if\\"".  Just don't expect it to help you figure out what that room would look like with a wall moved or crown molding installed.      I'm going to look at some of the other Chief Architect CAD software to see if that's a little more up to the task."
1,Easy to follow; have used for years.  Should be cheaper however.
0,"I upgraded to quickem 2013 thinking that it would help solve the problems that began with quicken 2012 when my bank \\""upgraded\\"" their home banking. Well.....I have had nothing but trouble and excuse after excuse as to why items that I could perform via downloading with previous quicken programs and my bank I can no longer do without entering transactions manually and reconciling manually. The bank says it's intuit's problem, quicken says it's the bank's........so who do I believe?"
1,Thank you!  Needed this quickly and got it!  It was a very good price too!  Thank you very much for making this easy!
0,"I have always used Norton, but, recently, I had heard that Norton is not that great.  I researched products and found that BitDefender had a higher rating than Norton, even though some reviewers said it is not as user-friendly.  Well, I wish I would have stuck w/ Norton, since I never had any problems w/ it.  Not that my computer is the fastest thing in the world, but BitDefender made it run more slowly.  Also, I could never complete a deep system scan.  It is supposed to take about 8 hrs, but, it would run for maybe 4 hrs, then say it couldn't complete the task.  So, where the red ball is, there is always an exclamation point, saying I need to address an item, which is the deep scan.  Seeing as how I cannot return the BitDefender, I would have to try to find a cheap Norton product to replace it, since I already feel I wasted too much money.  I wish I had stuck to Norton.  Also, w/ BitDefender, is occasionally turns off to update and the ball turns grey, which is worrisome.  I never got any viruses w/ it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, as it uses up too much memory."
1,I've been using turbotax deluxe for years and I am very pleased with the software.  Very easy to use.
1,i love it work perfect
1,I love this software with all of my heart. It is good and has lots of good stuff in it for the children and the people to use. Yay for software.
1,Have used Avast for some years on a number of computers.  100 per cent happy with it. Very highly recommended.
1,the daughter thought it was a very fun game
1,This exceeded my expectations!  I've used this professionally for years but never on my home systems.  this is a must item in everyone's &#34;toolbox&#34; for home use.  Buy it! You will thank me later
0,I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for at least 10 years. H & R Block ..here I come. Taking out schedules C & D is totally unacceptable. I know at least 15 others that buy this program every year. I am currently calling and emailing them to dump Turbo Tax programs. This is simply a money grab but this time I believe you are about to take a big HIT! I truly hope you take the largest profit decrease in your company's history. I feel that you just lost your most loyal consumers and I'm sure they will share their frustration with all of their friends and relatives. You made a BIG MISTAKE. You're bottom line just fell through the basement. The millions of satisfied customers you had are about to abandon ship.<br /><br />I would also hope that Amazon will pull your products from their inventory.
0,"This is the same old \\""no bugs fixed\\"" \\""upgrade\\"" Quicken has been foisting on its customers for years!<br /><br />I will start with credit for considerably speeding-up the entire download process.<br /><br />Here are some bugs, mostly from 2009, still in 2013:<br /><br />Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End STILL respond differently in the investment and banking registers.  The correct \\""Windows standard\\"" result is for these functions to go to the top (first) entry [home] or last entry [end] of the REGISTER.  Home and End (without any other keys held) should go to the extreme left (home) and extreme right (end) of the active FIELD.  From an old DOS program [Gedit, distributed with QDOS], Shift+Home could go to the top entry of the actively viewed register, and Shift+End to the last (empty) entry.  This would considerably enhance navigation.  Speaking of which, it would be nice if the cursor movement keys would work in the Accept downloaded Transactions window.  It would be even nicer if those Transactions could be sorted using the column headings like so many other Windows screens.  It would be really nice if a \\""sort order\\"" feature could be added to the Transactions to be accepted: first by date, then by security/payee then by action.  See Excel's \\""Data/Sort\\"" feature.  Alternatively, have the sequence of column sort create that effect by maintaining the item order as each column heading is clicked.  Lastly, simply provide a way of moving transactions up and down so Accept All can be used.<br /><br />A way to activate \\""edit\\"" for a register line from the keyboard would be a good addition as well.  How about \\""F2\\"", which is Windows keyboard shortcut for editing a file name in the Explorer?  (I needed to change 30 transaction security names and using the mouse was tedious.)  Why doesn't edit-replace work in the investment register?<br /><br />It would really be helpful to be able to access, with a \\""maintenance\\"" feature, the internal links for the various ticker symbols.  I have had manyoccasions when these get out-of-whack and I would prefer to fix them directly rather than deselecting \\""Matched with online security\\"" and praying.<br /><br />Worst problem is the Quicken Catch-22, dating back at least to Quicken 2009.  The security and memo fields, when changed in the investment register, DO NOT change in the \\""linked\\"" banking register.  When a change is made to them in the banking register, a message displays that the change must be made from the investment register \\""to avoid losing data\\"", but it doesn't work.<br /><br />Below is a paste from my bug log file, some of which has been covered above:<br />1-8-2010 Survey:<br />The program is both powerful and limited:  Everywhere a programming decision is made, and not made a user choice, a limitation is created.  For example, downloaded \\""matching\\"" should be made an option (It would be MUCH easier to simply DELETE unwanted transactions rather than deal with the matching, whose action I cannot fathom anyway--and the disposition is unclear, except unmatch, which on occasion is not available.)  Also, in the investment register, downloads are arbitrarily split into \\""cash\\"" (moved to end) and investment, which serves no practical purpose, since only the investment register is sorted by date.  No \\""sort\\"" is available for the downloads (I prefer multiple buys/sells/dividends/etc. on the same day to be alphabetical) nor is there a \\""move up\\"" or \\""move down\\"" feature for the downloaded transaction.  The \\""accept all\\"" button is too (dangerously) close the the \\""accept\\"" button.<br />The reports have become absurd for printing and require exporting to Excel to create a format that is not one security (or two securities) (and category column headings) per page.  Just try the income report by security (50 or so per account) which I use for the tax return and you'll see what I mean.  There is no \\""maintenance\\"" feature to fix the arbitrary association of a security with the electronic security when it's incorrect, such as whenyou mistakenly answer \\""yes\\"" to the \\""is this security the same as\\"" question.  The security price history is not available from the edit security form.<br /><br />1-5-2013 Bug in Q2013 (not reported to Quicken):<br />Randomly getting message ''The resulting value is too big.<br /> Please enter it as more than one transaction.''<br />Has occurred both during security entry transaction and during CTRL+Z recalculate. (CLK T A/C JKM DB)<br />I also get ''Do you want specific identification of lots?'' for BUY transactions (LJK T A/C JKM DB)<br /><br />I have reported most of the above to Quicken (except 1-5-2013), but I suspect the information never reaches the Development Team."
0,Does Not Work.
0,"I had a hard time installing. Once it was installed, Norton continued to send me<br />renewell messages after new security installed."
0,"Setup is easy. Using the product is easy. I constantly have issues with it updating my financial transactions from both my bank and credit card (Chase). Then you have to chat/email/or call India and what joy that it is. They never resolve the issue and have to escalate. Eventually they will fix it but it may take two weeks. It will work for a while and then the process starts all over again. If you don't plan on using the auto update and download your transactions manually then disregard, works fine otherwise."
1,"Great products, I would highly recommended for my family's and friends.<br />thank!"
1,The price for this product is amazing. I was hesitant to purchase it because it did not include microsoft One note but then I realized that for the Mac version it is included in Word.  It only took about 5 minutes to download.
0,I downloaded this because i was told that my Quicken Essentials would expire soon. It would not set up correctly and the tech support at Quicken offered to fix it for me for 199.95. Ridiculous! 200 dollars to fix a 45 dollar program. What a scam.
1,"Easy to file your taxes using this.  That's what we all want, right?  an easy way to give our hard-earned money to the government?!<br />I've used H&R Block taxware for the past 3 years and like it as well as any.  There's a place or two where I wonder what to do, but I've used Turbo Tax and found it was the same way.  I would never file a paper return again--refunds are fast-usually within a couple of weeks."
1,I have used avast  for a long time and have not had any virus get my computer. Had Norton before and viruses got in and Norton would find it after it got in but could not fix it.
1,"Norton 360 is a solid anti virus suite. I've been using updated versions for over ten years.<br /><br />Thus far, no harmful viruses have successfully attacked my computers.<br />Bottom line: good product that one can use with confidence.<br /><br />Amazon download to Software Library work well and quick. For second and third pc, one downloads again from Library with key code.<br /><br />Living off its name? Perhaps the price is a tad high due to popular brand name &#34;Norton&#34;."
1,I've found H & R Block's tax program to work well and at a price that is better than its competition.
1,This was the download version and was able to input the license key into the free version 2.0 and didn't have to do the full install to get this validated. Highly recommended.
1,pretty idiot proof and easy.  wish they had a lot more banks and financial institutions for importing.  have to wait for delivery.  not the end of the world but sure would be nice.
0,I have no idea what this is .....
1,Never had a Virus problem in more than a decade!
1,"I've been using QuickBooks Pro for my small business for a few years and frankly I don't know how I ever lived without it.  It reduces the amount of time I spend on accounting to a minimum, helps me pay my employees on time and does a most of the things I used to pay my accountant thousands a year to do.    Quickbooks gives me piece of mind by letting me see my business from every point of view, from the big picture to the finest details.  And it's easy."
1,Worked out just fine and gave me instructions on what to fill out and include.  Let me file several ways to find out which way would give me the greatest return.  Much cheaper than  having someone else do it for me.
0,do not buy this product.I downloaded it numerous times and tried installing it numerous times. It did not install. I asked for a full refund.
1,no problems great program
0,"TurboTax is easy I agree<br />And 5 stars hence I would give easily<br />But I was lead as so many see<br />That state e-file was completely free<br />Fool me once, shame on them<br />I can bet you it won't happen again!<br /><br />Sorry TurboTax for the one star but I can't rate the product seperately from the buying experience so if I get dinged, so do you.<br />You can take it up with the Amazon product titling department.<br /><br />PS. I give Turbotax 4 stars."
1,Useful tool!
1,"I Really like it. It's so much easier to use than anything I've had before. So I gave it a 5 star rating, because I haven't had it that long and so far it's been doing well."
0,"You are locked in for 12 months, if you cancel they charge 50% of the remaining months. This may be clear on here but it sure wasn't on the adobe website."
1,I had never heard of Avast but had my laptop optimized recently and Avast was recommended.  I have had no problems whatsoever - and I do not get blasted with marketing e-mails.  I like the form of alert when I am surfing the web.
1,"Cool, fun to work with."
1,This software is great for managing windows across multiple displays connected to a single computer. I use this to keep my windows organized across 3 monitors. Lots of features and configurations options.
1,Norton has protected our computers for years.  Not sure I could trust anything else.
1,This Tax Return Software examines every possible tax scenario to determine what tax benefits might apply to the user. It is also a very user-friendly tax return software.
1,no problems
1,Instead of installing Outlook 2013 directly from the Microsoft site I chose to download the &#34;img&#34; file. I then burned it to a DVD and installed Outlook from there. So I now have an &#34;Installation&#34; disk if I need to reinstall Outlook in the future. This will save me time because I only had to download Outlook 2013 once.  I also got the product key from the site so that I could finish the install. I had Outlook 2003 previously installed on my system. I had removed Outlook 2003 before starting the installation but it left around my settings so when I installed Outlook 2013 it picked up all of my setting including my Inbox folders and my address book. I have Office 2007 installed so I was able to use &#34;spell&#34; check. It doesn't automatically spell check as I go along but I am able to spell check before I send a note and that all works correctly as far as I can tell.
1,Avast has saved my computer a lot I love avast a lot thank you for keeping my pc and my family safe online
1,As expected
1,"Avast anti-virus and internet security package has been my choice for a number of years. It is user friendly, effective, and it does not try to take over your computer. It scans and sniffs out viruses and mal-ware according to your personal settings. I started years ago, because it was free (there is still a free version). I gradually migrated to the pay for protection version, and I have been very pleased with the program and support. I would recommend the Avast product line to anyone who is searching for user friendly protection that is effective, and plays well with other software that you may be using."
0,It's okey.
1,"Very Good Prices I Get It By Black Friday Within 19.99 U$ 5 Licenses / 1 key User ,Good For Protection Your Pc/ Tab / Mobile"
1,works great with self employement
1,"Before I decided to use Turbo Tax, I was going to a tax prep guy. Although their service was great, I cringed at the cost to get my taxes done year after year and I dreaded getting everything in order for \\""someone else\\"" to do my taxes. Finally last year I decided to do my taxes myself using the acclaimed Turbo Tax. You can be as dumb as a jackass and still get your taxes super professionally done using this software. It's amazing! The software does all the hard work for you calculating and computing everything as you go. There are all kinds of prompts and reminders and instructions every step of the way as well. There's even warnings as you go[[ASIN:B005S4Y13K TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011 for PC [Download]]] to make sure you get the job done right the first time. The software even offers you an audit protection service for pennies on the dollars (not that you will need one if you use Turbo Tax). I've never felt this confident about doing my taxes until I landed upon Turbo Tax. I will never go to a tax consultant again. Why should I??? I have the resolute solution! Turbo Tax! It's GREAT!!!"
1,still working
1,"Great software, used for first time in my life for my 2014 Federal Tax return. Was easy to install, setup and compile the tax data. The printouts were awesome. The eFILE system was the best. Received my refund from IRS in a week. Will use it again for the 2015 Tax period."
0,"Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything else on the market, so Quicken is what it is: pretty much the only fully fledged finance software out there.    It's not fantastic, and things like ads upon startup (you will get them eventually - the reviews that don't see them maybe haven't run it enough?) for software I paid $60 for is pretty irritating.    That said, it's connected to my banks without any issues so far, and in lieu of other options, works well enough - better than tracking manually in Excel, and better than their free product Mint, where you can't correct anything that is wrong or missed bank download info."
0,"I'm writing this review in hopes that the pop-up &#34;reminder&#34; to review Avast on Amazon will go away.  I really the developers offering Avast for free despite the immense work they have put into the program, but I am also not happy about the amount of &#34;reminders&#34; the newest version packs in it.  Otherwise, I have used Avast for 3 years running and have yet to have a virus despite relatively heavy Internet use and moderate downloading."
1,Best  product  for learning  a  new  language  it meets all the needs of anyone trying to learn a new langage and very user friendly. That is why I give it the top rating.  I have not seen or heard of any other language products that is so complete and  still make learn easy and fun
1,"Once you get used to using the 2013 version, I find it easier to see and use.  Replaced 2012 version because every time I had a computer cash, and did a system restore on it, my 2012 version data was corrupted.  One crash since 2013 installed and no data problems after system restore.  A real plus.  Been a user of this soft ware for a long time, and definitely like it.  Have recommended to friends for their use."
0,Terrible interface. It doesn't matter if its a powerful product if it doesn't work. Adobe should be ashamed. Please find an alternative product.
0,"Don't get me wrong, we love the software (been using since 1997) and how easy it makes it to e-file taxes, we give that a 5-star rating.<br />We expect the software to go up 5 or 10 dollars from year to year, but forcing me to buy a higher version at $40 more is a bit much. We give that a 0 on a scale from 1 to 5.<br />Intuit states it is standardizing their Turbo Tax software so the online, mobile and PC/MAC are the same.<br />Then again my personal opinion it is all about the &#34;Benjamin$&#34; aka the bottom line.<br />You'll need to make your own decision.<br />Hope they make things right and issue &#34;Abort destruct sequence code 1 2 3 continuity."
1,I have used Quicken since I bought my first computer in the early 1990s for easy checking account and credit card maintenance in addition to investments.  A few years ago I started using the Premier version mainly for the tax help with investments.  This new version helps even more with investments with its portfolio analysis.  It will actually give advice on how to balance your portfolio.
0,"Started tax return after switching from Intuit.  The updater reports an update is available, however after taking 10 minutes this destroys the installation.  Very poor."
0,I have used Quicken for PC for years and love it.  I just switched over to Apply and &#34;ASSUMED&#34; I would get the same Quicken I have used for years.  NOPE!  I really hate the Mac version and will use an older laptop and continue to use the PC version.  It is really unbelievable how different the 2 versions are and how much I truly hate Quicken for Mac!
0,"I'm not sure I can understand why it's so hard to get software that I PAID FOR!!!

1,Great as always.

1,Fast and easy to work with.  I have no complaints.
1,I like the features Norton has over other mobile security software.
0,"This was the worst release to date for turbotax. From excluded forms to 7 days to fix the importing problem with its deductible. I also bought home and business version, same poor results. I will look at tax cut for next year. Been using turbos since 1995, this is a real disappointment."
1,"We have used Quicken since 1998 when we were preparing to retire.  My husband dutifully entered all of the investment data, but then became busy and did nothing to it for 10 years.  When I installed the Quicken 2013, I did not convert that data because it was totally outdated.  I have not been a power user and really just used it in the same way I had used a paper ledger for many years.  I would like to use some of the Download features, but when I have tried it, a new file was created for the account that didn't exactly match the old one.  I have deleted the downloaded one and continued to enter data by hand.<br /><br />Why does the program create a new data file for the things I download?  I even went back and changed the name of each account to duplicate the new names given by Quicken and tried again.  However,the same thing happened.  I know I can just backup the old Quicken and use it for reference, but I really like being able to look back quickly and find when I did various transactions and do long term reports.  Is there an easy answer to why a new file is created for the initial download from the Bank, Credit Cards etc.?"
1,I have used WEBROOT for 10 years when I started it was good now it is very very good.<br />I will never change from this software.<br />I have use most of the other brands ---- this is the real deal.

0,"This is an improved picture over my Ultra 11 version and much of it is more automatic & simpler, but I have one problem. I cannot get the auto resume to work in General settings for any DVD. I know that it is not going to do it for Blu-Ray DVDs, but my standard DVDs will not auto resume. It will not memorize where I was at and will never keep track of where I left off. It won't prompt for auto resume and it won't come back to the last scene either. The Ultra11 version still works fine on the same Computer (I did not delete that version yet until I see if Ultra15 is going to work out). I sent my complaint to Customer Service and it requested some technical information which I fully sent to the Technician but all he did was advise me to go into General setting & select auto resume! I explained to him that I Already informed him that it doesn't work. He just wasted my time & it takes days before they reply back. Poor Customer service.He doesn't seem to know what he is doing. It is very annoying and I find myself going back to Version 11 Ultra to play DVDs when I play a DVD & do not have time to finish the Movie & quit early. The DVD always resumes in Ultra 11. If you have the same problem all I can say is that Ultra 11 works fine. Cyberlink's Customer service in the past was better, but now it is awful."
1,Easy to use and packed full of good features.
0,"TurboTax has been good to me for over a decade, but it's increasingly frustrating to use with slightly more complex tax situations. This year, TurboTax couldn't deal with college savings plan distributions. Data I entered from form 1098-T did not carry over, and TurboTax insisted that I owed taxes for excess withdrawals. I spent over an hour with a friendly support tech, who agreed there was a problem, but could not resolve it. She bumped it to a supervisor who (immediately) said it was an error that would be fixed shortly. 6 wks later, error is not fixed.<br /><br />I finally threw in the towel and went to an accountant. He saved me far more than he cost, and didn't waste hours of my time.<br /><br />Too bad; I had been pretty satisfied with the product, but now realize this is not a cost-effective use of time for anything but simple tax situations."
0,This product is not user friendly. Tried using this product for small business and found there was only one or two parts to the program that was pertinent to a sole proprietor business. Can do everything I need in Excel. Don't waist your money.
1,"Inexpensive, had trouble loading due to previous version not compatible but tech support really helped and is working great. Highly Recommended"
0,"FRESHBOOKS is the winner here. I spent years trying to figure out QuickBooks, tutors and all. It just didn't click. FreshBooks is so easy! The site is beautifully organized and so intuitive! I got started a couple of months ago and still find myself shaking my head at how simple they made it!"
0,I wanted to like this but it didn't/wouldn't work on other devices and the help center wasn't really helpful so it's not being used for additional devices...which is the reason it was purchased...otherwise it works just fine on the one unit.
0,It slows my computer down a bit and I had trouble getting my computer to recognize it. It protects my computer just fine though.
1,I have been using this program installed by my son in law for over a year and I love it. Never any problems with unwanted virus or software because this blocks it and notifies you every time. I would highly recommend it to others.
0,Beware that you can't import TD Ameritrade buy/sells.
1,Works fine with me
1,easy to use and keeps every account accurate. Like the password feature
0,Would not install. Tried for an hour and a half. Real annoying. Much better off purchasing a boxed cd version!!!
1,I'm rating it 4 stars because I had trouble finding it on my computer after downloading it. I'm sure this is due to my lack of knowledge using windows 8.1. Other than that it's great.
1,"My kids love this program! Theyâ€™ve used all 3 levels now and it keeps them busy and out of trouble. My 6-year-old caught up in her reading at school quickly once she started using the program. My older son got ahead in his reading last summer and asked me to play it nearly every day! Now my youngest is using Level A and learning how to write letters, their sounds, and making patterns. I highly recommend this program and think itâ€™s a great way to give your children a boost in their reading skills!"
1,Awesome Software that uses very little system resources. I've never had an issue and it stops everything unwanted from getting onto my system.
0,"[[ASIN:B007JYRIDW Rand McNally Parks for Garmin (PC only) [Download]]]<br />This product is totally useless.  I am planning a trip to Yellowstone and Mesa Verde.  I spent the $14.95 expecting something with the Rand McNally name would be useful.  (I have yet to find it on the Rand McNally website).  After purchase and searching for POI's, I phoned and talked to their tech support about why there were no points of interest.  The person I talked to had never heard of Yellowstone.  The program does show the locale of 3 places in Yellowstone, but not as points of interest.  I called the following day and talked to someone (Chris) who had heard of Yellowstone, and he acted surprised that there were no POI's in Yellowstone or other parks and said he would escalate the matter and get back to me.  That was 10 days ago.  Save your money.  If they are legit, they have major, major work to fix this product."
1,"Best Antivirus<br />Having gone thru a few, this is the best antivirus I have used.  It protects against all the nasty &#34;bugs&#34; out there!"
0,"Had to buy 2013 after I already purchased 2014.  The 2014 software kept booting me out every time I opened a checking account. They said fix was coming, but who can wait for that."
1,Seems to catch most bad stuff for me...<br /><br />Like that it's free<br /><br />Easy to use and doesn't seem to interfere with other processes<br />(unlike the Norton Utilities suite)
1,The program works flawlessly and is an enjoyable upgrade from 2012. I don't usually upgrade each new release but this one was an excellent choice.
0,"Not sure it was worth it. It is easy to use, but the price is pretty steep, and if you know you are not going to itemize your deductions there's really no reason to buy this software instead of spending half an hour manually filling out your return."
1,I'd recommend this...it keeps your computer secure and the price is right!  Don't hesitate to get this one if you're in need.
0,I has to call 4 times to turbo tax to get it to work.
1,"This product would have been great if it didn't automatically assume everything from your checking account as something you'd never categorize it.  When you pay bills to say, Home Depot, whenever you buy something in person at Home Depot, it files it under the same thing.  There is too much duplication within the software making things super confusing for the user.  Mint.com is honestly just as good yet you don't have as much customization - meaning, you can do a TON MORE with Quicken, yet you have to want to put in the time.  If you want to hire yourself as your own accountant/book keeper/finance manager as if you are a small business, it may even be fun for you.  I found it to be super time consuming and irritating trying to keep up with every purchase or bill I pay.  ONE great thing is, all your checking/savings accounts are listed and updated in real time so your finances are always RIGHT THERE to view in literally 2 seconds upon opening the program.  There are good and bad things, I'm sure if I put even more time into it, it could be fantastic.  So the key words here are &#34;PATIENCE&#34; and &#34;PERSISTENCE&#34; and &#34;PLUGGING AWAY&#34;."
0,"I downloaded this software and once the program was installed I tried to register online.  The program kept telling me it could not connect to the internet. After two days of trying to find a solution, I am ready to try the 60 day satisfaction gaurantee.  Do not buy this product!!!"
0,"This was a waste of money and had I used it's guidance, I would have had to pay in to the IRS. I had use this product for three years, but never again. I just do not trust it."
1,I've been with Norton so many years.  Item is a must for computer protection.
1,It worth every cents I have paid for it. I am loyal to Quicken since 2000. Every two to three years I update it so I can get what is new.<br />Great!!
1,"Avast! has been around for a long time. IMHO this product has superior virus protection. I have always appreciated that the company has thought the regular guy should have high quality virus protection without having to pay for it. You can also upgrade to more features for a reasonable price. Whether you choose the enhanced protection, prefer basic protection only or can't afford to pay for virus protection, Avast! is an excellent choice for piece of mind with this quality, efficient protection from the wild without the bulk and sludge like that of other virus protection products out there."
0,I downloaded Open Office 3.1 recently and lost four important files. These files crashed shortly after I was asked to contribute $$ which I was willing to do but I was required to run Java Runtime Environment which I am not familiar with. Since I was not able to pay up I guess I was punished. I also experienced a number of other flaws. Open Office 3.1 is dangerous. Beware! I'm not willing to upgrade to 4.1
1,"I've been using Avast! Free Antivirus for years, and it's my choice above other major antivirus programs primarily because it offers super protection without hogging your computer's resources. In fact, you would never know Avast! was there, doing its job; it has never slowed down any software I'm running. The program updates its virus definitions every day inconspicuously in the background, only giving a brief notice that it has done so. It alerts you immediately if it finds a virus, some specific spyware, or a malicious web page. You can select from various &#34;shields&#34; you want Avast! to run, and you can run a full virus scan at any time. Registration (via e-mail address) is done once a year. I highly recommend Avast! Free Antivirus to anyone who wants superior protection for your personal computer, with minimal drain on your computer's resources. I trust Avast!"
0,"This product is the EXACT same price that Garmin is offering it.  There's no point in buying it here, I might as well buy from Garmin and cut out the middle man."
1,It works flawlessly for me. I love it. I saw a whole lot of very negative reviews when the release came out so I decided to wait another 6 months before buying. Kudos to Quicken support team to fix all major flaws albeit belatedly. I am very happy with this product. 2-yr old Premier was crashing on me too frequently and would not generate year-end copies. 2013 version works great!
1,Shockingly you will have no issues if you wait for them to update the product to match laws passed at the last second by Congress&#60;/sarcasm&#62;<br /><br />I've used TaxCut now H&R Block for ~10 years. A fantastic product every time.
1,"quick and easy, however, don't know if it is because it was replacing one that had expired a day before, but after downloading new one I checked for updates and it had 18 updates to download and one patch. Then I ran a system scan and it found 59 threats ( and resolved them).  So I would advise after you download you might want to check for updates and then run a scan"
0,"I feel like I was tricked into buying this version, when I really thought I was getting the one with one State Tax included.<br />Not happy at all!!!"
1,"Not perfect but has worked great for our 9 rental properties and our own finances. I've used Quicken for over 20 years. Takes time to set up and maintain records, but is invaluable to have financial data in one place. Be sure to make regular backups on separate media!"
1,I like Turbo Tax. Some people complained about the price but it was worth it to me.
0,"Problem with software is that it adds other programs on your system...programs that will eventually cost you,  I am very concern with programs that takes over even when you follow the instruction of not wanting to install....I answered no to two of the other software that it wanted to installed...It installed it anyway.  Maybe a good program but I wiped it off my system as soon as i could see what it was doing....Its suppose to be a malware fighter but imitates malware...something wrong with that for sure or is it a merchandicing ploy...malware??"
1,"I have this program on my PC at home, my android phone and my tablet. It's great, love it will never use any other anti-virus software again!"
1,Great bargain and value.
1,Overall very happy with Kaspersky. The software runs quietly in the background and protects all of the devices I have. Haven't had any issues so far. User interface is pretty easy to navigate and it gives me so many options to protect my computer
0,I purchase the print master v6 because I could install my other software on to my new computer. It wasn't anything like what I'm use to using. I like be able to take a picture out of a picture and put it with any back ground I choose. Or I do cartoon pix with someone's head for family calendars. I couldn't do that with this software. I got my old software on my new computer now. It's one I've used for years and its much easier. I really haven't used the new one much.
0,I've used Norton for years. I did get a virus once. I feel semi protected. Still not sure who's better: Norton or McAfee? I highly recommend purchase from amazon because this is the least expensive place to get it.
0,Isn't that great wouldn't recommend anyone getting this. I wanted something to correct photos this isn't worth it. Wish I could get a refund totally not satisfied.
0,Downloaded this product today but I can't use it.  There is microphone requirement to use this.  Just paid for a product I have to go to the store to buy accessories for??? That seems crazy.  They should list that in the description.
1,"I started buying Turbo Tax 10+ years ago, it is a simple step by step way of completing your taxes.  Things you still have to keep in mind is read the guides that come up and if they pertain to you, they do a great job with examples to help you understand, there is no way I could do this the old fashion way of using the book with forms like I did 15 years ago, to complicated.<br />The built in deduction finder is a great tool to determine what your items are worth and walks you through all the needed steps.<br />A few years back I tried H&R, I followed theirs along just like TT, once completed I was certain something was wrong as the figures didnt even come close to what I have had in the past (salary position so things stay pretty equal). I than purchased TT and ran it through again, there was 3 things that H&R didnt include, I went back and tried to see where the mistake was and could not find why it was not promting me to enter a deduction.<br />I will continue to use Turbo Tax each year, it auto-fills in your info from last year and than does a comparison to your previous year.<br />My only complaint is the State E-File should be free also if you purchase the State."
0,Almost a law put out by Congress and the Senate.  It is voluminous and mostly not helpful.  Why should any program require that much verbiage?  I still cannot use Outlook even after scanning this book.
1,"Generally it corresponded to what was expected. I have given four stars beacuse the link to redeem the product key had not been provided. And it was not easy to find it -  it was not available directly on the McAfee page. I found it by search as<br /> http://home.mcafee.com/root/ecards.aspx?affid=0&pkgid=274,275&flow=cdkey&cid=78244<br />After that I was able to download the code and installed it smoothly."
1,"I've been using TurboTax since it came on floppy disks and still love it.  I'm just interested in trying out the competition because I've gotten use to the method the app works.  Each year, I've been more than satisfied.  And the Download version is the way to go so you can let Amazon keep up with the application without concern of losing a disk later."
1,"I'm not usually on the side where I find virus protection programs to be conducive; but, other than a couple of misjudged error reports, this software seems to be pretty light and quick pace."
0,I've been using Quicken for window for over 10 years.  I'm still learning Quicken for Mac.  It is a little different but even with my abilities I seem to be figuring it out.
1,&#34; Great! lot of options that make it an all in one program.  Very inclusive. (you don't have to download a lot of other things to make it happen).&#34;  This review brought to you by twitch.tv/prophet_doom  I bought this for my husband and this is his handle and i'm asking him for his review as he's playing a game.  Ask him more if you want more info on this product but he's VERY satisfied with this product.
0,"I downloaded just to try to make a professional, conservative letterhead but it did not work for me.  There seem to be a number of features but they did not work for me - I could not change the color of the text for example. I wanted dark not colors.  The feature to chage the colors was there - but it did not seem to work. Probably more than I needed in any event."
1,Excellent protection
0,"Fairly simplistic, but nice for a refresher."
0,It is taking too long to get the healthcare part of TurboTax to complete my return.
0,"installed this program , not an easy process. then i tried to install antivirus and it's not compatible. Two programs from NORTON and THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE with each other. FOR SHAME ON YOU NORTON"
0,"I don't know what is going on at Intuit, but each succeeding release seems to lock up more and more.  I have had to absolutely abandon using Rental Property Manager due to its issues."
0,"Granted, my expectations were probably a bit off. I have used H&R online for years and assumed I would be able to connect to my online account and download my history. I found no way to do this. I had also become used to the words/verbiage online, and found that the desktop version was organized differently (and more confusing to me). Finally, I bought early to get my taxes in ahead of the rush. The same IRS document would become available online 1-2 weeks before it was available through the software updates.<br /><br />All in all it costs roughly the same, but my experience was that the online version was much easier to follow and more convenient."
1,Have used this product for years with the automatic update feature and have never had a problem with my computer being infected.  Have no reason to change.
1,I would give it five stars if I did not get daily pop-ups requesting that I purchase other Avast products.
0,Program would not allow me to do a form 982.  I purchased HR Block's and no problems at all.  I should be able to return this gargage.
1,Its Norton 360 you get what you get it works....
0,Ive purchased downloads through Amazon in the past and never had trouble until this one. I could not get it to work and neither McAfee or Amazon was willing to help. Both were notified of the problem via email and neither wanted to offer any assistance or accept any responsibility. I also could not get a refund.
1,"I don't know how one could ask for more from a free product! The interface is especially good, as is the protection."
1,"I purchased this after trying a few different products.  This wasn't the cheapest, but it was the easiest to use.  I've not done anything more than play around with a fake house mock-up, but when pitting this against others, this product came out on top. The quick re-size from bounding boxes is what set this apart from the others I tried.  The easy of use is great.  Just wish I waited a few weeks as 2013 came out just after I purchased this."
1,"A free product that is lite to operate, without compatibility issues and without ads."
1,"When it came time to renew my internet protection software, I decided to try a free trial version from 4 different companies to see how they compared.<br />This one lacked some features that was offered by other software but it was my favorite primarily because it was less annoying than the others. I want my protection to run in the background without pop-ups telling me what it is doing. Some of the others also made it difficult to download software by identifying it as possible malware.<br />And the price was 50% off what the AVG website was asking."
1,"I've been using TurboTax for many years and I like all the new up dates that they add every year, I will probably buy it next year."
0,"After upgrading to deluxe, i was unable to efile (wouldn't accept) and now I'm out $19.99 and must snail mail!<br /><br />I have tried to get help and nothing works.  Next year I'll go with something else."
1,"I've been using this product for a year and saved money by buying the downloadable version rather than the disc in the box.  However, I had a bit of a harder time with the download and I had to e-mail Norton to have them add some time left over from my expiring 2012/13 version onto the new download.  They answered the e-mail very quickly and fixed the ending date correctly.  I'm very happy with the program.  Last year I found that at some point after a few months they will update the entire program to their latest version so I will eventually have the 2014 release anyway."
0,"Over all this Software is pretty clean , is the best available if your into aesthetics over power.  It has a corporate culture based off customer social inclusion.  You get to feel as if you are a part of their family or a culture of Cook'n Users.  That is where the price really comes in, and for some, the  aesthetics and general feel included factor is a value worth the price.  That being said there are some main features where the concept is solid for the functionality is a bit away from where it should be.  Navigation can be a bit tricky and buggy, and of the functions that do work well, It is nothing that you can't get from any other software in the genre.  In fact most others that lack in the aesthetics are a lot cheaper, easier to navigate, and function a lot better.  The integrated browser is a failed concept here. Just go login to Pintrest and create your own board and subscribe. Book'n 's whole scan a recipe functionality is really under par.  Pictures you scan have to be a specific quality for it to really work semi well. I found that for all the reasons I got Cook'n  were really poor and functionality was just not there.  What you are paying for with this product is really just how nice it looks and the newsletters sent out that are nice and friendly.  The price list,  all recipe software packages do this, Cook'n makes and attempt to actually provide you with some prices, but to be honest your going to find that a lot that you thought Cook'n was going to do , your going to end up doing yourself manually anyways. .ue is not resolved.  That was ok too, figure there is a lot to catchup on, But what they don't understand is that my emails send me a notice every time my emails are read, or deleted without being read, or received but not read yet.  Turns out they are deleting my emails now, doesn't look like they are going to live up to their 200% guarantee.  The 1 star is because too many business attempt to use this &#34;Jobs&#34; like Golden Circle inclusion marketing but fail when it comes to customer support , especially when customer wants a refund.  Don't advertise a 200% guarantee if you don't intend to back it up.  They are your best friends until they are not lol."
0,"Purchased today, now I'm into two+ hours trying to debug why it won't install on a new Windows 8 machine.  At one point, Microsoft tried to charge me for support - for installing a brand new product!  I can't tell if this is a 2013 issue or just a Microsoft office.com issue - but stay away if you can!<br /><br />Caveat - I'm a long time Amazon (prime) customer - this is my first experience w/ Amazon customer service.<br /><br />Update - after Microsoft customer service didn't get back in our agreed time window I finally got Amaozon to agree to refund.  Ignoring my time - I've spent more on cell roaming time (I'm travelling on business) than almost the product cost.  With Amazon, after repeated denials for a refund - I finally reminded them of their tagline, ~ \\""world's best customer experience\\"".  Turns out they then refunded my order when I rated them as poor to mediocre.<br /><br />Net net - Microsoft customer service is organized as a terrible experience - after two hours I haven't spoke with anyone other than level one/two customer support.  Amazon download is apparently a separate division with very restrictive policies."
1,"I've had other &#34;big name&#34; anti-virus packages over the past ten-plus years, both laptop and desktop, and all seemed to consume noticeable quantities of CPU - one even tied up my PC for several minutes a couple times a day to refresh its virus library. Avast is always somewhat busy in the background but never stalls my PCs. Just a soft voice announcing it had updated its list of viruses. As a side issue, the other anti-viruses I've used never cleaned out the registry and always left scattered file behind them when I uninstalled them - I had to use a professional &#34;uninstaller&#34; package to clear the remnants from my PCs - but that's not uncommon with software packages in general."
1,I was very satisfied with all aspects of this purchase and would recommend this seller and product to others interested.
0,"I guess my Only and Biggest problem with this product is that it does crash a lot . Every time I start a project ,corel is not responding. Its very frustrating but other than that Its awesome."
1,"This is the best antivirus that I know, i have been using Avast more than 4 years ago. The system never gets slow, others antivirus are too heavy for the OS. Easy to use, free, excellent virus detection. I recommend this antivirus."
0,"I did not download this program from Amazon but directly from Encore. I am also disappointed not to be able to use Print Shop 23. So far, every time I have tried to print from this newest program, the program crashes and shuts down. Thankfully, my wife's computer runs Windows 7. I installed the old version of Ptint Shop there, and can still print from it. Very, very disappointed with 3.5."
0,THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE = UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD - NOW OUT THE PRICE OF THE PROGRAM AND HAVING TO BUY ANOTHER<br />UNABLE TO CONTACT THE COMPANY AS THERE IS NOT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS ON AMAZON OR AT THE OWNER SITE HAVE WASTED NOT ONLY MONEY BUT 3 HOURS OF MY TIME<br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
1,don't use it didn't work on the computer I had
1,Realty great product i decided this the security I will continue using as it is light fast and reliable
1,What more can you ask for?  It works and it doesn't hurt. Always up to date and on top of the threats.
1,We've used TurboTax for years and have been as happy as one can be when paying taxes.
1,A littler difficult to use as you have no instructions.<br />But once I figured it out it just to a little time to do. Then works great
0,"I have a Magix product and after having a severe crash, I lost most of my software and did not have the mandatory serial number due to losing all info. They have bar none the worst customer service. No way to contact them without buying a 30.00 support card. So, I have a worthless photo program. You may love it as long as you need NO support"
1,The people at Intuit have some of the best customer servive
0,"Total rip-off!  First off: it claimed to work for Windows 7, didn't work on mine.  Second: the claim for 4000 fonts is exaggerated by counting every font several times; once for standard, once for bold, once for italic, once for bold/italic, once for wide, once for condensed etc.  Then the \\""different\\"" fonts that they label looked more like the same four or five fonts over and over maybe with one letter different in each alphabet.  Finally the font manager that comes with the product just sits & spins every time I try to browse for fonts to \\""manage\\"".  I have a brand-new computer, so there is not a problem with my computer... this product is a joke!"
1,"I have been using Avast on my PC's for years and it has performed well and never let me down, the mobile version is proving to be just as reliable..."
1,Great as always.
1,Was delivered as advertised
1,It's amazing and user friendly.
0,"I don't like the fact that it does not download to my desktop.  I can't use it off line.  I have to be online to use it.  Sometimes I don't have internet access and I need to be able to use the program whether I am connected to the internet or not.  When I purchased it I had no ideal that it wouldn't download to my desktop for use.  Sometimes I like to be able to access the internet when I am working on something, this isn't possible."
0,Not as easy as previous editions and I have used it for half a decade. Because of the needs for me to do consulting work as a business I bought this. But it was certainly more friendly for that aspect last year.
0,"It is a little too early for me to make a full review since I have been using the new Quicken 2015 for Mac for just a few weeks now. It seems to be working OK but the display is not as sharp and well centered as it should be. Using Yosemite, I might have to make some adjustments before I accuse the development team at Quicken for not sharpening their programming tool and present a slicker version of the program.<br />I will be digging into some the features that existed in the Windows version but not in the Mac Essentials version, and I hope that I can find some of these features back in this new program. I also hope that Quicken will provide the development team with sufficient resources to make this program a winner in the Mac world. Needless to say that more Apple computing products are being sold than ever and the growing number of users should be a great reason for Quicken to continue its efforts in providing a great financial software to help us all managing our money."
0,"I downloaded thisystem. Would not work without more updates. Tried everything to download updates, no luck. What a waste of money."
1,I've used TurboTax for about 4 years now.  It's great.  Walks me through every small detail.  It double checks everything and it compares it to the last years return.  Then it gives me the option of mailing or electronically sending my return.  I will buy it again next year.
0,I've used H&R for the last few years and it's been mostly ok. VA requires companies to e-file starting with FY2014. This stupid program doesn't even warn the user that this is a requirement and this program is not approved to do so. Now I'll have to re-input this into an approved tax software or try to ask for a waiver. Waste of time. This is the last year I use this.
0,It looks like Intuit completely replace the budgeting module with one they inherited from their Mint.com purchase. What an excruciating step backwards. It is riddled with bugs and totally unusable. I'm sticking with Quicken 2011 and won't budge until Intuit goes back or else makes dramatic improvements to the budget module.  Microsoft Vista was not this big a disaster.
1,"Very great product ! It works how I was wanting it to, I am very satisfied ! I suggest people to buy it !"
1,"I was stubborn at first and was sure I had made a mistake, but after using it for 3 days (I'm scanning lots of stuff), I made the right decision to upgrade from Photoshop 9.  Several neat new features, and very user-friendly.<br /><br />Highly recommend Adobe products.  Couldn't live without Photoshop."
0,Only lasts for a month and constantly reminds you that it is going to expire.
1,price was perfect and had all my p.c's running right.  The only thing i didnt like had nothing to do with the seller but with norton trying to pull funds off my card with out contacting me
0,OK - but a come-on to buy more sophicated software
0,"I did not want to buy an updated Quicken, as my 2009 Premier edition was fine for my needs. However, Quicken makes it impossible for customers to keep a version for more than 3 years and you HAVE to buy an update after 3 yrs are up -- the ugly side of capitalism. It would not be so annoying if the updates offered significant improvements, but they do not.  Having bought the Quicken 2012 deluxe edition, the download and updating of files worked easily and quickly. I think the 2012 edition is noticeably faster than the 2009.  However, there are errors and bugs.  I noticed that the new Planning-Budget report/graph had errors...  1) For example, the salary/income section for January shows a red number with the \\""under\\"" tag, indicating a deficiency. However, I get paid on the 31st, as most people do, and Quicken cannot handle this. I guess I have 3 more years of being underpaid for everyday in the month except one!  2) Another example is that payments made TO my loan accounts show up as withdrawals in the Planning/Budgets report/graph. So, according to this summary, which is supposed to keep me up to date on how I am doing, my loans are getting LARGER with every payment I make to them!  I have carried out several hours of online \\""chatting\\"" to try to resolve these, but I began to feel that they were using me to test their product, because they asked me to generate new files and then \\""try this...\\"" or import all my financial stuff from my bank and \\""try that...\\"" and so on. I gave up and sent them some e-mails describing the problem. I went to their website, thinking that perhaps i was doing something wrong, and there were SEVERAL HUNDRED postings from customers who were having the same issues and were trying to resolve them.  Another problem was in creating scheduled pill payments or transfers...the numbers in the splits and the accounts seemed to have a mind of their own, and I had to correct my new entries several times.  In fact, this new Budget Report thing is useless...Ipay for everything with my credit card, then I pay off my credit card with my checking account. This report only tracks payments made from you checking account to your various expense accounts. So, what is the use of having a list of expense accounts with no payments being made to them?  To summarize, I have had to forced to pay for a new version of Quicken whose only differences compared to the 2009 version seems to be an increase in speed (good) and the new budget stuff which does not work (very bad) and is quite uselss. If you are interested in Quicken, check out the website to see the feedback, and NEVER buy an update until your 3 years are up. You might want to look into using Moneydance, which I like...the only reason I have not switched over is that while Moneydance converts all your data files, it does not convert any debt reduction plans and the like. Maybe I should have bitten the bullet and done it anyway.  One last comment: I think people who are switching to the online, free, Mint software and the like are making a big mistake -- you don't know who is looking at your stuff and what they are doing with that information. I prefer security and privacy."

0,"This product is terribly buggy.  I purchased it hoping to avoid the muck that surrounds current online bookkeeping products (in addition to keeping my private data out of the cloud), but now wish I'd just stuck to the online route.  Avoid this software."
0,"I would like to get a refund. Except that refund site doesn't seem to work. The 2014 works like the other versions I have had of Quicken, which I would say is great!  However, the 2014 version as bugs in it that cause it to crash and Intuit doesn't not yet know why are what to do to fix it.  It should never have been release.  I am back to using the 2013 version of  Quicken and am very happy with it.  I just wish Intuit for fix it or give me a full refund for it."

1,"I have been using Curationsoft for over a year now and must say it is by far the most advanced content curation tool i have used. A lot of content sources, easy to use interface and breezing fast performance...what more could you ask for?"
1,Works seamlessly and does a good job.
1,It takes a while to master this program - thjere are a lot of options and they are nbot always obvious.  Once you have learned your way around the program it has a lot of useful tools.
1,"Since we have QuickBooks online, all my customer information is with me at all times on my phone.  When a customer calls, a QuickBooks icon comes up by there name.  My customers are impressed by how much I know about them before they say a word.  They think I have a great memory.  Thanks QuickBooks!!!!<br /><br />I recommend QuickBooks to small businesses that I see on an almost daily basis.  People are blown away by what we can all accomplish now compared to life before the online version of QuickBooks.<br /><br />My secretary also loves how easy it is to use.  It is easy to navigate the program and has saved her tons of time.  The estimates and invoices that go out by e-mail are very professional."
1,As expected
0,I just installed this. The interface color scheme gave me a headache within 3 minutes. I don't usually have issues with this. The Microsoft tech was absolutely useless. I will now be fighting with Amazon for a refund and/or blocking the charge on my credit card. I don't know who at Microsoft thought deploying a product with such an abhorrent interface was a good idea.
1,"I've had a personal computer for almost 25 years, and I have NEVER EVER EVER had any sort of virus.  Until last week, when my beloved Alma Mater, Oklahoma State, played (and beat, btw :-)) Washington in the Cactus Bowl.  It was televised on ESPN, which I sadly do not subscribe to in my cable-free home.<br /><br />So what's a girl to do??  Obviously, search for the game online . . . .<br />(As an aside, I have done this repeatedly in the past with no issue.  But, my luck finally ran out.)<br /><br />Although I consider myself relatively computer savvy, I somehow installed malware, spyware, adware, scareware, ALL OF THE ABOVE, with one of the links I clicked.  Suddenly, every time I opened a browser window, it was covered in bright and flashing ads, and I was redirected to another hijacked website with every keystroke.  LITERALLY, EVERY KEYSTROKE<br /><br />I have never been a fan of anti-virus software, because my experience has been that it slows down performance and interferes with network connections.  Plus, I'm such a careful internet consumer, I didn't think it necessary ... so, in a nutshell,  I've been surfing unprotected . . . .<br /><br />After my malware infestation, I activated Windows defender.  It found nothing.  So, I deleted all of my browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox), and re-installed them with the default settings.  Still the pop-ups and redirects.<br /><br />I installed McAfee.  It scanned, and scanned, and scanned, and found nothing.  Still the pop-ups and redirects.  At this point, I've wasted an entire day.<br /><br />I then searched blogs and advice forums for hours and hours - from my iPad as that was the only way to avoid the never ending pop-ups.<br /><br />Based on blog advice, I installed Kaspersky.  It scanned for hours and hours and found nothing.  Still the pop-ups and redirects.<br /><br />I booted in safe mode and rescanned with McAfee and Kaspersky.  This took almost ALL OF THE NEXT DAY.  Nothing found.  Still the pop-ups and redirects.<br /><br />My computer was basically unusable.  I was on the verge of tears and ready to lose all of my photos by dropping it off for a $200 re-image at a local computer repair shop.<br /><br />After one last Google search, I took a chance downloading Malwarebytes.  I have to say, I was nervous to install it, because I've never heard of it, and I was worried that it could be a Trojan Horse.  But honestly, at this point, I didn't have much to lose.<br />After one TEN MINUTE scan, it found more than 1300 suspicious objects on my computer.  I quarantined and deleted them, and all seemed well, until I tried to type on an open webpage.  Flashing pop-ups everywhere.  Ugh.<br /><br />I shut down, rebooted in safe mode, and reran Malwarebytes.  It found nine more objects which I quarantined and deleted.  MAGIC!!!!!  No more problems with unwanted programs.<br /><br />I used the trial version that I found on the Malwarebytes website, but I will be upgrading to the paid version on Amazon as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />I am a very very very happy customer and highly recommend this software to anyone battling seeming unsolvable problems with spyware, malware, adware, scareware, or any type of potentially unwanted program."
1,It works great.

0,"If you do not know how to work QuickBooks already, it is difficult.  I couldn't even set it up!  I am still not using it, because there is no manual.  We had to upgrade out Mac just to download it."
0,"The program is expansive in it's ability to address the many tasks and techniques involved in video editing.  The program could use a code review, it seems to slow significantly when used in conjunction with Photoshop and perhaps the coding for various processes could be improved for efficiency.<br />Small Suggestions:<br />1. The ability to copy and paste chapters between projects<br />2. The ability to open project workspaces (lower half of page), side by side.<br />3. The ability to create gridlines for movie and menu design and align elements such as buttons centered, left, or right of the gridlines."
1,Purchased this for almost half what Norton wanted me to pay to renew.  Norton has been very good and I've had no problems except setting up Chrome to not block it.
1,I have been using Avast for a few years now and it has been absolutely dependable.  I am very impressed with the ongoing enhancements to the software.  I first learned about it from my college instructor and that was good enough for me.  It has caught viruses that other very well known commercial software (McA...) did not stop.<br />...... ..
1,"I have been tracking 100 plus accounts for years with Quicken for Windows. I wanted to switch to Mac but was afraid to try this program. All old transactions imported flawlessly. All itemized categories as well. Uploading is now easier. I understand the anger at the loss of features but for what I need, it is an improvement and I no longer have to deal with Windows."
0,Don't buy the digital download from Amazon. Unable to install and Amazon customer service ineffective.
0,Years ago I switched from Quicken 2007 (Mac version) to Quicken Essentials because support was stopping for the latest Mac OS updates. At first I couldn't believe that I would no longer be able to track stock purchases.  Eventually the on-line stock sites did a better job of tracking purchases and I was less inclined to keep that level of detail locally.  A few weeks ago I received the critical alert message from Quicken saying that Connect Services for Essentials would be discontinued in April.  I was so comfortable in Essentials that this was an agonizing decision for me.  I even tried iBank 5. I ended up making the switch to Quicken for Mac 2015.<br /><br />It is an OK update.  The interface is much improved and while it is still not close to Quicken 2007 it is a step in the right direction. The import was flawless and the mobile sync is something I will make use of.  I can however see how folks who really want to record their financial life would still be disappointed with this version.<br /><br />Update: So I have migrated most of my accounts.  The biggest headache is getting brokerage type accounts up to date.  The issue is that Quicken Essentials did not support at a transaction level so all that info was lost.  Some brokerage sites I use have downloads but many did not.  I tried to automate this via a CSV file but no-go.<br /><br />The software has crashed (quit unexpectedly) 5 times so far.  That seems inexcusable.
1,"Was able to download and apply to two of my computers. Stores passwords, great protection. This is a good product.as soon as I paid for it, I was able to  download."
1,I think it works marvelous
1,This is scrap booking made easy.  I made my Christmas cards with this too!  Very cool my new favorite way to scrapbook.
1,THE DOWNLOAD WORKED PERFECTLY AND QUICKLY.  WE NEEDED A NEW QUICKBOOKS PROGRAM TO PLACE ORDERS FOR OUR BUSINESS THAT EVENING AND THE DOWNLOAD WORKED IN MINUTES
1,I had to replace a very old version of another product and wasn't happy about having to learn and enter all of my info again.  Quicken makes it relatively pain free and I have easily adapted to using it.
1,"great price,  I've used Turbo and H&R, multiple times.<br />I like H&R better and it cost less.  Got online version to download directly.  went smooth."
1,"I have always found TurboTax very easy to use and convenient.  I haven't brought in my data from Quicken, but will when there is a better version of that software."
1,great product
0,"I don't really know if it works yet but I know it is a PITA to install.  I should have uninstalled Norton, I guess I should have uninstalled Norton first.  Kaspersky went through the uninstall 3 times before I finally told it to skip it - Norton uninstalled the first time through.  Then it gets to &#34;5 seconds remaining&#34; and takes another 5 minutes.  Then it decides it needs the key.  Then it wants me to register and that sits there for minutes.  I don't think computer geeks understand how pissed off that makes those of us who just want to use a computer - not stare at it.  Hopefully the silly thing works."
0,Useless without a local folder.
1,I have been using Quicken since 1992 and throughout the years it has improved greatly.  I used the 2014 Quicken Deluxe and upgraded to 2015 Quicken Home & Business.  The main complaint I have had and complained about over the years is on the reports the columns are crammed together however there is plenty of room on either side to expand the columns.  I still want Intuit to figure out how to make the columns on the checkbook  and the reports simple to double click on the lines to auto expand in order to read the entire data in each column like MICROSOFT EXCEL!!  It is very frustrating to print out a report and only half the type in each column be printed.  Maybe they even need to wrap text??!!
1,"Had Norton for years; Internet Security for 1/2 of that time.  Never had an issue with virus/malware, etc.  It does the dirty work of keeping your system clean for you.  Wouldn't be caught without it."
1,"What can I possibly say about this product that hasn't been said. It is PERFECT, and was very easy to install. This product is a necessity."
1,EXTREME VALUE I HAVE HAD THIS PROTECTION FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE XPERINCED NO PROBLEMS AT ALL .<br /> LOVE IT
0,I paid for the product and the key provided is listed as expired while trying to install. To whom do I speak to have this rectified?<br /><br />Update: It turned out I had to call AVG. Their response was they had to register my product and assign me a new key. I am glad it was resolved but I should not have had to call in the first place.
0,"I was disappointed in this product. I had used TT for several years, and wanted something more affordable. This year I entered tax info into both softwares. HR block was not as user friendly and the tax refund was a few hundred dollars less than TT. I wish I could get my money back. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,excellent
1,Very easy to install and to share with other computers in the house.
0,"For background, this program is being run on a HP laptop currently running Windows 8. Bought this after reading several tech/it reviews stating that for 2013 this was the best antivirus on the market for a combination of speed, unobtrusiveness, and protection. On the speed part they were definitely right. This antivirus spends most of the time in the background, has practically no drain on computer performance, and runs scans insanely fast compared to my last antivirus (Kaspersky Pure 2.0).<br />  On the unobtrusiveness, that's a mixed bag. Most of the time it is unobtrusive, it runs in the background and unless it finds something it needs your attention on, you'd never know it's there. The problem comes in surfing the web. Pop-up ads are one of the banes of the internet, which is why most browsers have settings to block them. The problem with webroot is even though the ad has been blocked, it still sees the threat, dims your screen and brings up it's own pop-up notifying you that there's a potential threat. It can also be a little overzealous with cookies, often treating ones you allow as viruses and closing out webpages your trying to view. Just so there's no confusion, two of these sites were Amazon and Outlook. It will eventually learn and you can set sites you want it to ignore, but that does take away from it's unobtrusiveness.<br />  Finally, as far as the protection part goes there haven't been any problems. About monthly I'll turn Defender back on and have it scan just as a sort of second opinion. So far no infections and no malware. If you're running Windows 8 looking to download an antiviral program and don't mind fiddling with it a little bit it's alright for the price. At the time I bought this there weren't a lot of options available for download and the price was right, but in the future I'll probably go back to Kaspersky or something along those lines."
1,This is the best antivirus program I have ever used.  It runs flawlessly in the back ground keeping my computer safe.<br /><br />Thank You avast.  Michael McGrath
0,"While video quality increases and yes this program does add in features to edit 4k ultra high definition video, everything else gets down scaled. This program, other than the 4k markup, is not as good as Movie Studio 11 which is kind of hard to believe so the only added benefit would be 4k markup unless you really want to do video editing via touch screen which I don't recommend. There are less transitions ect, just less stuff in this than 11. Its the same royalty free music and sound effects they provided with Studio 11. So if you need to mark up to 4k and want less stuff than this is the program for you. Also if you never used any of Sony video editing software there is learning curve involved like all editing software. This software is unstable and I recommend back ups every second. I just don't have a lot of good to say about this in a review as its just not as good as studio 11 is and was, the only thing that is usefull about 13 would be 4k markup that's it! I also didn't really like the 4k up-scaling in this program and feel Corel X7 does a better job handling and quality wise with UHD files. So that my 2 cents! Enjoy!"
0,I wanted a simple video converter to convert itunes video so that I could movies and tv shows on my Samsung Galaxy Note II's sd card. The activation code never worked and it always shut down the software when I entered the activation code.
0,"I really like the midi feature, the feedback mechanism is important, it has some weird fingering recommendations, I would use in conjunction with another book<br /><br />I hate the accompaniment, the demo songs play with full instrumentation, I want just the piano, a miss."
1,"I downloaded the software and did my taxes in less than an hour.  Our taxes are pretty simple: pensions, social security, IRA withdrawals, two residences, no big medical bills.  Since the app imported last year's return, there was virtually no data entry other than the numbers from our 1099s and tax bills.  Well worth the $9.99 I paid for it."
1,"Ever want to print something from your screen and when it prints you have 5-6 sheets of paper cuz the browser software 'can't compute'?<br />GET this! You always have it loaded, and when you hit the 'print scrn' key a box pops up and an set of cross hairs. Click where you want to start, then make a big box and click agaion. PRESTO! Your print area is highlighted!<br />You can print, save, modify the document, 'draw' on it, lots of stuff.<br />WORTH EVERY PENNY! I use it in real estate and for my continuing ed computer classes."
0,"Edit: 9/2015 (Originally given 4 &#34;stars&#34;)  I gave a pretty decent review of this product, initially. It seemed adequate, but a bit more cumbersome than Intuit's product. I had used TurboTax for years. Then, Intuit started getting greedy and began packaging forms in each of their products so that consumers would have to buy the next &#34;highest&#34; version in order to get the one form they needed.  I finished my 2014 taxes ahead of schedule. I sat back...fat, dumb, and happy. I had run the accuracy check, as recommended. What could go wrong?  The IRS told me. In August, I received a terse notice from the IRS that I had &#34;not yet filed&#34; my 2014 return. I had the certified return receipt and thought their assertion quite mad. Ah...there were &#34;missing forms&#34; in what I had mailed and the IRS position is (properly) that a return is not considered &#34;filed&#34; until all of the forms needed are provided by the taxpayer. The nice (grumble) tax man explained what forms were missing and I opened the program to see what had gone awry. I ran the accuracy check first...  ...&#34;Congratulations!&#34;, I was told. Everything was there and the calculations were flawless.  I manually looked for the missing forms and could not find them. The program never guided me to them, so they were blank. I had to re-file/amend my return because H&R Block's program doesn't really check for completeness. I had to manually override some of the forms in order to file for 2014.  I will not be buying H&R Block's software again. Intuit might be greedy...but their program is flawless. H&R Block's is pure rubbish.  END of Edit  I suppose my title is a bit confusing. Sorta like saying, &#34;The food here is lousy, but you get big servings.&#34;  Ahhh...tax time. It's conveniently six months (in either direction) from Election Day. It's that special time of the year when I dream of giving my favorite politicians...a barbed wire enema.  I once used TurboTax. They began nagging me to buy their newest product as soon as I printed or e-filed the current year. Then, about every November, my email box began to load up with 'reminders' from Intuit. Each year, TurboTax got shorter on features. This meant I was continually 'upgrading' (In English, &#34;spending more money&#34;.) to keep the same features/forms I had last year. TurboTax then started shennanigans of removing features/forms I needed from products. No, not just 'obscure' forms...forms most people need. Bad, bad Intuit!! Changing features and selling upgrades to put more money in their nasty little pocketses. We hates Intuit. Phooey!  I decided to give H&R Block's product a run. It was about 50% of the cost of TurboTax (which is, in my experience, always an estimate since you find out you need a 'more advanced' (wink-wink) version of TurboTax only AFTER you coughed up for the one you bought last year because the forms have 'moved' to the new 'Super Premier Deluxe Exclusive for (a few) Homes, (select) Businesses, and (some) Hobbits' version...&#34;available for a limited time&#34;).  The (Mac) download went flawlessly. To my immense surprise, the product launched without a hitch. TurboTax NEVER launched properly until I made at least two calls to their support people (who were always helpful and pleasant).  The Block 'interview' was not as sleek as TurboTax. The graphics are rougher. You get 'checklists' (which are sometimes poorly explained) instead of the sleek TurboTax 'interview' conducted by a barely dressed Russian super-model. But, if you are of normal intelligence and don't need dancing pandas to entertain you as you figure capital gains, the Block program is more than sufficient in getting information out of you. Editing information already entered is a bit cumbersome (trying to find stuff is like playing 'Where's Waldo?'). But, the program gets the job done.  Especially helpful, is the 'Cook Your Books' feature where you can hide investments and minimize oil profits using thespecial 'Tax Chicanery' button. JUST KIDDING, Mr. IRS guy. (That's a feature only found in another vendor's, &#34;Koch Brothers Special Edition&#34;...sale-priced this week at $4.7-billion as a download.)  The Block program also offers features familiar to TurboTax refugees, like the 'audit meter' that graphically shows your risk of being subjected to an IRS-paid colonoscopy. (I call this meter...'The Mendacity Meter'.) Calculations are spot on. The program does a pretty good job of ferreting out forms you may need, but would otherwise forget to file. It even made quick work of new forms and information related to Oh, Bummer! Care.  I'll probably use this product again next year. I used to spend over $800 to a professional who would complete my personal and business taxes. So, this created a substantial savings for me...that I can now, instead, spend on some new tax or 'fee' levied by those friendly scoundrels in Washington.  So, if you do your own business taxes (or are amused by getting spankings from total strangers)...I highly recommend H&R Block's tax software when &#34;It's that time of the year&#34;. (Rumor has it that the aces in DC plan to launch their own, IRS-based tax software next year. They were going to launch for this tax year...but their supplier for high-voltage nipple clamps ran into manufacturing delays.)"
1,Worked Good
1,Easy to install if you have a Microsoft account
0,It was not aproved in my device
0,I always used Microsoft Money and I loved it but had to switch because it became to outdated. I started using Quicken in 2013 so this is my second upgrade. I was very upset when I upgraded from 2014 to 2015 because the transition of one of my accounts completely jacked the account up and I'm still trying to fix it. It added in transactions and deposits twice. Such a pain. It would be nice if they offered an upgrade price. I only upgraded because it was cheaper here on Amazon. I wish they would put a feature in the check register to had transaction once you have reconciled.
0,I give this product one star only because I can't give it zero stars!<br />I was lucky to get my money back and that was only because Amazon came to my assistance.
1,This organizer has simplified my life so much.  Now I have a lot less paper all over the place.  I can't do without it !
1,I all ready had quicken on my home computer I needed on my Surface for when we travel. Only had a single license which required an additional purchase.
1,"Though it can be intimidating and complex, using Quicken actually becomes easier the more you explore it. It helps to be a user of other financial software, like Microsoft Money. Terminology will be different, but the learning curve is much shorter. You may have to make corrections to imported data, particularly to deposits versus payments. Check imported data carefully."
0,"I need to be able to sell items that are not in stock, or in more than one quantity. If this is possible, I would like to know how. You have to enter each product under the Product Management Tab, and then go to the inventory management tab to add the price. Trying to get a discount on an item is a pain. I still haven't figured it out. I really wish I could return this and spend the money for something with more options."

1,Switched from TurboTax this year.  Have completed my taxes and very impressed with the process using the H&R Block solution.
1,"I have always used MS Money, then it went away.  I was forced to use Quicken as it was the only other option out there.  I have been using Quicken for 4-5 years and they finally got a version that I can give praise to.  Yes the versions always did the budget, snyc'd up my accounts and tacked tax expenses but this year, they now have an app for my ipad!  I love it!  I can now see where I am without having to remember now what was the last entry on my quicken on my desktop at home.  Thank you and keep up the good work."
0,"There is certainly room of improvement.  Being a non-accountant I wish there was a better help system,  I have had a number of questions that were difficult to ask because I did not have the right &#34;context&#34; to form the question."
1,It was easy to use and import last year taxes. Have used Turbo Tax for many years. Very friendly program.
1,Excellent!
1,Overall I like it.  There  are a couple changes/improvements I'm still getting used to.  But I'm am definitely glad I updated.

0,"I use applications like Photo Shop and Apeture and was looking for a simple application to refer my friends to. I'm useing a macbook pro i7 with 8 gigs of ram. My new copy of PhotoStudio is registered. This application is supposed to be an easy and intuitive application to use. When using \\""file/open browser\\"", none of the tools can be applied to photos opened this way. You choose \\""open\\"" and the photo just sits there with no way to resize it, close it or anything.

No doubt there's an easy way this works, but there's no help in the help menu and the so called tutorials are a scam.<br /><br />On the arcsoft site there is a link to \\""tutorials\\"". It is nothing but an ad to buy the application. The \\""24 hour help\\"" is only for installation and registration help. There is no \\""form\\"" as they claim to email questions.

1,"works great, easy to download!"
1,Thank you!
0,Works ok for trial period and then asks for upgrade.
1,"Great software, been using the free version for years."
1,I've been using AVAST for a few years now and for a free product it is truly worth the membership.  It gives me piece of mind knowing it will catch viruses and infected files and it actually provides periodic reports of the findings.  I haven't purchased the full protection since it's a business laptop but the added security doesn't hurt.  I highly recommend for the budget conscious.
1,Way better than any other that I have tried including all of the main ones that you can purchase.
0,"About every five years or so I take a chance and buy Quicken for Mac.  This version, purchased in 2014, undoubtedly has every fine feature that Quicken 2000 (for Windows) does.  Intuit continues its long-standing practice of putting out a stripped down, subpar product for Mac users at an inflated price.  I purchased an earlier Mac version years ago and was disappointed then.  Don't take my word for it, just check out other reviews on the net.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Keep that aging PC and buy a 2 or 3 year old version of Quicken (Windows) for about $12."
1,"Have used Quicken for years, this was just another upgrade."
1,yes the guides are clear and very helpful as are the examples  like quicken very much send an email on sale for next years quicken thank you very  much
1,"I have used H&R Block tax software for the past four years.  The download was very easy, and the price was much lower than other sites."
1,"Intuit payroll is very easy to use and well worth the reasonable price.  Everything is calculated for me and rarely do I have to call or instant message customer service.  When I do contact customer service, they answer my questions promptly in a friendly manner."
1,"I absolutely love using Intuit Online Payroll to pay my team - I used to do it manually, using spreadsheets and a lot of sweat/tears.  When another entrepreneur recommended Intuit to me, I was really thankful - now, it takes me about 5 minutes max to run my payroll every other week.  And I get notifications to remind me of filings and other required things regarding my employees.  The headache I would get when I had to run payroll is gone - now, if I could only get other parts of my business to run this smoothly!!"
1,"I decided to go with H&R block Deluxe this year instead of TT Deluxe because of the price increase to file with Schedules C and D. So far so good, I was able to install the software and import last years (2013) return from TT. Everything is looking good. I will update my review after filling."
0,"They removed Schedule D without  highlighting that fact anywhere.  I had used this product for years and ordered it this year as well.  When I found out they had removed schedule D from the online submission capability, I demanded a refund.  I am going with H&R Block this year.  I am not going to be forced to pay the extra money for TurboTax 'Premier' addition, just to get the functionality that I always used to have.  TurboTax is going downhill very fast."
0,Program downloaded to the desktop and the icon remained attached to the installation program. There was no selecting it from the Start Menu. No icon on the desktop. Could not run this no way.
0,Wouldn't load.  Wouldn't work.  No Refund.
1,"Avast is easy to install and use, does not interfere with my computer use, and I have had no viruses or malware while using it."
1,"No problems or complaints about this product. The download took only an hour and a half which was pretty good time considering I have an abundance of mobile devices connected to my WiFi. The product itself is almost seemless and runs with sophistication and eloquence. It could honestly utilize more of my macs features but the lack thereof doesn't hinder the overall excellence of this product. Recommended for anyone who is impatient, like myself, and needs a productive processor for his college classes and miscellaneous jobs. I haven't encountered any problems yet but that doesn't mean there aren't any."
0,"Daughter's state filing was rejected.  Free Federal Filing cost my daughter almost $ 30.00.  When I try to open to file another return, I get a message &#34;invalid signature on file&#34; please re download.  ANOTHER DOWNLOAD FEE?????"
1,Works very well.
0,"This is OK for accounting, but it's a very scaled down version of the one available for Windows. I like the Windows version much, much better."
0,Awful !!! This product would not download despite carefully following the instructions that were provided. The screen where your country is selected has a continue button which despite appearing green in color did nothing when clicked and remained on that same screen. I have submitted a request for a refund. Apparently the previous reviews where this problem was noted are still correct. This has not been fixed.
1,It was installed with the new windows update that was needed after XP stopped being supported. That was not a cheep endeavor. I wish M/S would just let us stay with what is working.
1,"I recommend it to everyone, the features can help you keep your computer functioning proper and virus free. Make sure you try it"
1,"I have been using it alongside Quicken 2012 premier (Quicken 2014 won't even install on my Mac with Parallels) for 2 months. The more I get used to it, the better it gets. It is good enough to make Quicken history for me. Quicken just seems to get bulkier and worse each year."
1,"Works as advertised... Able to convert audiobooks to mp3 in a reasonable time.  Ran into 2 problems, both on the same book; (1) error message reporting out of memory, surprising with 16 gig of ram and over 100 gig free on the drive (2) had a couple tracks hang inside Audials, would not convert and no way to save them.  Had to determine the start and stop of both files and use a sound capture software to grab them.  Overall pleased with the software and would recommend it."
1,Use it for my business and its super user friendly and there so many functions
0,"BEWARE!! of the total cost. Intuit sucks you in with what looks like a great deal initially and then charges you for what should be included in any normal tax return. 39.99 for adding a state, 19.99 per state for e-filing and if your tax scenario is a little bit complicated more add on charges await you. All told my bill from Intuit was $140. I have been using TurboTax for 10 years now and have been an evangelist for it for many years. This year however I felt duped. Treat us like adults Intuit, be transparent with the costs of filing a normal return. Let people make the decision based on functionality. Most of us are not looking forward to tax season, why aggravate us further? Had it not been for the identity theft brouhaha Intuit would have had no reason to give discounts this year. Very unfortunate that what was a good customer friendly product has finally been swallowed up by corporate malaise and duplicity."
0,"Have been using Print Shop since version 5.  Last purchased 22 before upgrading to windows 7 and thinking I needed to run Print Shop version 3.  I wanted to cry when I saw everything this product no longer did.  It is a piece of junk compared to it's predecessors.  Thankfully, some nice people out there documented how to install 22 on windows 7.  Much happier now.  Will probably be the last version I run unless they bring back what the product once was."
0,"I only downloaded this because I got a new computer, and my husband had lost the CD to the 2014 version we had purchased earlier.  We run Quicken through our home network, centralized on one computer.  In order for me to be able to continue to input data, I had to install it on my new computer.  With the CD lost, had to do this download.<br /><br />We have been using Quicken off and on for years, but with more detail and more &#34;religiously&#34; for the past 3 years.  It is a VERY helpful tool, and we will continue to use this product.<br /><br />However, many of the glitches in the 2013 version are still here in the 2014 version.  Like flipping away from a certain function (but leaving it open), then flipping back to it, only to discover that it always re-scrolls to the top of the function ... regardless of where you were on the page.  End of the world?  No.  Annoying?  Most certainly.<br /><br />We have contacted Intuit multiple times about these annoyances, hoping that one of the software upgrades they roll out periodically will fix the problems.  Not so far, though.<br /><br />Doubtful will spend $$ to go to 2015 version.  Probably will give them a couple years to make ACTUAL changes in the product.<br /><br />But if you have NOT used money management software before, this product is the place to start (and stay) as far as I am concerned.  It really makes a difference in helping control where the money goes!"
0,This program &#34;lost&#34; 3 days of work for me. It is dangerous
0,Do not waste your money on this software.  You could set up the same thing as an Excel spreadsheet.  Microsoft money is a much better package.  This does nothing but keep a running total.  Worthless.
1,Works great
1,I have used Avast fro 6 years with no quirky software issues. Easy to use runs flawlessly in the background and will alert you as soon as it detects a poetential threat. I have been spared a virus countless times. I simply follow the recommended actions to defeat or contain the infected e-mail or software and go about my business.
1,"Update: stopped working on my windows 7, and auto fixed could not fix it either still is working on my windows 8"
1,Former TT user for the past 10 years that switched from TT Deluxe to H&R Block Deluxe because of TT requiring Premium to do schedule D.  Very please with my decision It downloaded with ease and its a clean and simple program to use and it imported my info from TT 2013 without a hitch.  Glad I made the switch.
0,"I just Bought it and already I need to buy it again ,I thought it would last longer ...I mean I bought a pkg, May 3rd then again I had to buy another on May 31st.  Please! tell me what is going on....."
0,"Quicken should be sold as a yearly subscription like the Amazon Prime and not a purchase. I am like others who have felt like I paid for features only to have them &#34;expire&#34;. And expire fairly quickly. Features that really didn't cost the company any money, but is rather used as a tool/threat to force you to upgrade at a fee. I first purchased Quicken in the '90s and loved it. I continued to purchase it several more times over the years. I wish I didn't have to rate it, since I only want to make sure everyone understands how Quicken deals with you. However, giving one star is the best that I can comfortable give."
1,"I always recommend Avast to all my friends and family.  When working on anybodys computer I recommend they use Avast and do install it for them.  Works great, has saved me several times."
0,"I understand every year something changes with the taxes. Previous versions of this program are better than this new one. Separating the forms is rather taxing and more expensive. The best program that was used was 2011/2012 when all necessary forms were in one version. In the future please take into account that when doing taxes and having to continue to go back and forth and or stop to add and purchase more forms, is inconvenient."
0,Lost some of the benefits of Adobe Photoshop 11.
0,Had a lot of problems with this app and had to uninstall it.
1,"The Rip works good, have not tried the Burn."
0,"If you have a PC using Windows, stay away from this ! There are issues with the download software that may not allow the download. Amazon will not refund your payment though its a known problem. Amazon gave me a Intuit website to send the request but Intuit refuses to acknowlwdge it. I would suggest finding a better product to buy from a better supplier. Very disappointed."
0,Had nothing but trouble from the time I did the instalation.Very little support from Norton with a service tech with a bad attitude.Would not buy again.
1,"While QB Payroll Enhanced does a lot of the reports and paying for you, it is a little cumbersome in finding out how to file. I thought it filed automatically with the payments until I received notices from the IRS. Now that I've established the \\""paperwork\\"", I hope it will be easier."
0,"Awful! Product does not work as advertised....Customer service is nonexistent.....Lots of &#34;so sorry we can't help you&#34;, nothing useful....I couldn't get advanced scan to work AT ALL! Do yourself a favor and if you have to have it.....Preview it first!"
0,"I've been a loyal TurboTax Customer for over ten years. Greed does not play well in a capitalist country such as ours. Hence, I've now gone to HR Block Tax Software and will never look back. I sincerely hope Intuit goes bankrupt with their new improved pricing strategy. Their genius spawn at their top executive level deserve nothing better. Actually what I'd love to see is the IRS come out with a competitive product that you could either have for free (subsidised by we taxpayers) or purchased for a nominal fee."
0,"I purchased this item to protect a backup computer, but it would not download. I spent two hours on the phone with Symantec, but was still unable to download this product."
1,Easy install and functions as advertised. Price point is high given little new functionality. I would have stayed on the old version if not forced off.
1,"Excellent product, download only took a few minutes and entered security code after purchase confirmed<br />Wanted to convert movie files made with Picassa WMV files to MP4 files to use with the VonHaus Nano 3<br />Mini HD Media Box to play videos on TV.  Worked a treat and could not be simpler, recommend this product."
1,The improvements to Quicken for Mac have been helpful and made it easier to use.
1,I have used Intuit products for years but I quit trying to use the old MAC versions of Quicken as I could not get them to work from a Windows conversion (my data goes back to about 1997).  Got off on a bad start with the new MAC 2015 trying to convert from Windows 2013 and was actually ready to request a refund. I kept getting an error code 2000 (but found that it was totally my fault). I eventually I got it figured out and now everything is running smoothly. I'm still learning some of the reports and functions and there are a few things that I miss from my Windows version but I'm sure there will be updates that will add new features to this new Mac 2015 program. It is light years over their previous MAC versions! This year I plan on using the MAC version of Turbo Tax to see if it works as well as the Windows version that I have been using for over 20 years.
1,"I have used TurboTax for the past 6 years and it has continued to improve the user interface, the depth of investigation for tax &#34;relief&#34; by identifying areas that you may be able to use to reduce your tax burden.  Lots of helpful information with direct links to the appropriate IRS documents.  Although it costs, the tax review is very helpful and provided me with the information to ensure I had covered all the appropriate areas for taxes and expenses.  I find it a valuable tax help and plan on continuing to use it."
1,I am so happy I paid the extra to get Lightroom!  My daughter has it and taught me how to get the most out of it and my photos and literally popping off the screen.
0,"I recommend skipping this version.  I have used Quicken for over 20 years.  I usually update every 3 years.  This version has caused me the most trouble.  It was not easy to move my files over to this version.  The system is buggy and frequently crashes.  The most onerous issue is the need to sign into intuit's website vs your own file.  It forces you to have an internet connection and, as I had a Turbotax password, MADE me use that log in instead of what I use for Quicken.  Lastly, there are no new improvements worth the upgrade.  I recommend staying with your current version.  I wish I could go back."
0,"Super buggy, cannot load all bank accounts on. I have 3 user names / accounts at a bank and I have tried to add all 3 and only one will load. When I try and refresh it fails and the other 2 won't even load. It's weird as it's the same bank ... Intuit please fix the awful software.  I want a refund but not sure how to get one, Amazon please help get a refund. Can't just sell awful software and not be able to refund"
1,"Bought this as a replacement to Aperture and I wish I had done it years ago. For my purposes, buying it outright was better than paying for the Creative Cloud as I have no need for Photoshop (I use Pixelmator)."
1,Use my Garmin all the time.
1,"The software works great. Imports previous years, updates most current laws, and walks through every question with detailed explanation, then creates all of the forms you will need"
1,"While there are some minor oddities in the user interface, this series of software has made my life so much easier since 1991 (tax year 1990), when I bought my first copy."
1,"I was a big fan of how I had previously organized my recipes. They were all categorized and fun to look through. However, it wasn't easy pulling menus together and I would \\""forget\\"" about recipes I hadn't tried yet, because they were filed in a book. I bought Cook'n and off the bat, love it. I don't think I've used its full potential yet either. You can pull recipe plans together, search on ingredients (what do you do with extra \\""x\\""? search on it so it doesn't go to waste!), create lists, etc. And since I'm not the most technically savvy person out there, I have found their customer service to be amazing. The biggest downfall is that they don't have the Cloud yet, but that is coming soon. Will be getting the Cloud soon so I can use it on multiple devices!"
0,"This product can only run on one computer at a time because of the activation rules. I use a laptop and a desktop, but can't use the software on both computers without deactivating it on one of the computers first. I use Adobe products where I can run a copy on both of computers simultaneously."
1,Excellent and very easy to work with it.
0,I upgraded fron Q2007 Basic and it wasn't the smoothest.  Had to spend a few hours with online help getting the data to import properly.  It's working at about 75 now and I have to tweak a few more thinngs to get it totally set-up.
1,"Have used this program for years, and needed an update for a new computer."
1,Worked great!
0,"This is pretty much a graphically updated version of 2010's software to look good on windows 8. Now as for it functionality, it works much the same as the 2010 version and is therefore, fairly good office software... that is if you can get it installed!<br /><br />Users MUST now create a Microsoft user account in order to even install the software (or at least that's what happened to me). You must also have an internet connection or the software WILL NOT activate. During the install, I was not given an option to activate via telephone, though Microsoft's support website outlines steps in order to activate via phone, I could never get the option to appear (with or without my internet connected) and thus believe it is no longer available.<br /><br />After making an account, and attempting to use my product key, I would be transferred to a webpage that I assume was a legality checker for the software, only to be told that I can not use it in my region. (I'm a US military spouse, stationed on a base in Japan). So, even though I have a legitimate product key code... I could not use it! I did find a work-around after several hours of trying different methods to get it to work, but it cost money to do so ($10 to be exact). A reputable VPN company can mask your IP address and make you appear as if you are accessing the internet from a location in the US. This worked for me and I was finally able to download and install the software. This could have all been avoided if MS's product page and/or Amazon's product page mentioned that you can't install the software from any other country but the US/CAN. The downloadable version or Boxed version would be the same ordeal too, by the way, as I mentioned the activation and necessary account creation force you to be &#34;online&#34; for the process.<br /><br />Bottom line here is it is great software if you don't mind tearing your hair out to get it to install, and ONLY if you have internet access! If you already have 2010 version of office... don't bother with 2013 unless you MUST have a new feature not found in 2010's.office... don't bother with 2013 unless you MUST have a new feature not found in 2010's."

1,"THIS IS THE ULTIMATE IN MALWARE PROTECTION..I HAVE USED THIS SOFTWARE SINCE 2007 AND IT HAS SAVED THE DAY MANY, MANY TIMES..MY OLD LAPTOP'S MOTHERBOARD DIED AND I TRIED TO RE-DOWNLOAD IT TO MY NEW COMPUTER BUT I DID NOT HAVE THE OLD KEY CODE. I ONCE AGAIN TURNED TO AMAZON AND SURE ENOUGH THEY HAD THE SOFTWARE WITH A LIFETIME LICENSE CODE..I AM ONCE AGAIN PROTECTED.."
0,"Your supposed to get an activation code in the confirmation email of this purchase but it wasn't included in mine.  There is a link in the download to get help obtaining an activation code but I've been on hold twice for 30 minutes each, no answer.  I've been in the chat section waiting to be helped twice for 30 minutes each, still no answer.  SO, not only do you have to wait for the USPS to get your W2's you decided to do them on your own and you can't get an activation code.  This activation code is your ticket to e-file.  So far very unhappy I have bought a useless software!  Not to mention the activation code is to allow you to have technical support while trying to figure your taxes out.  From the looks of it if I come across any trouble areas I'm stuck!  I guess I'll need to start the hassle of getting a refund and visit a good old brick and mortar to get things done!!!"
1,It's free. It works. Nough said.
0,I am tired of all the updates they do and you have to relearn Quicken every time I update
0,I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for many years so my expectation was that this product would meet my needs for 2014.  After purchasing the item I was notified by e-mail that the Deluxe version had been modified and no longer covered brokerage transactions and that a product that served me well in the past at about $50 would need to be replaced by the more expensive Professional version at a cost of $90.  In addition the fact that the state filing is an additional charge even though the package suggests it is included is irritating. I have enjoyed the Amazon gift card bonus option and made use of it 2 years in a row.  I will be switching to H&R Block for 2015.
1,Have been a Turbo Tax user for past 6 years. This makes it easy to do your taxes.Will purchase again next years version.
0,I have been a loyal TT customer for over 20 years and shocked again by their price gouging with this new bait and switch to Premier from either Basic or Deluxe Version in prior year. I think that Bob Meighan has lost his mind in thinking customers will blindly follow him off the cliff. This should be the beginning of the end for Turbo Tax products. I remember Bob from Price Waterhouse as a good guy and do not understand where he lost his way this year. I will not purchase Premier and hereby end my relationship with Turbo Tax & Intuit after an over 20 year customer relationship.<br /><br />Remember Palm Pilot and Blackberry? Turbo Tax will be next with this arrogant thinking that they have a monopoly in tax software and can do as they please.
0,"Just another sucker who thought he was buying the new version of the program I've used since forever.  But no, to get the functionality of last year's version, they want $40 more.<br /><br />Avoid buying this through Amazon downloads, too, since they will not allow you to &#34;return&#34; it, even given what seems like fraud.<br /><br />In one fell swoop, Intuit and Amazon Download have both let me know my business is not wanted."
1,"Update for X6 Release:  I started out using WebPlus X5 and absolutely loved it.  It enabled me (a non-professional web designer) to produce professional looking web sites without any web design knowledge.  The WebPlus X5 product was so easy to use and the support from Serif was incredible.I upgraded to WebPlus X6 as soon as it was available.  If you are familiar with the functioning of Window and MS Word, you will be able to dive right into this software and begin designing as I did.<br /><br />I found all of the functions of WebPlus X5 & X6 to be so similar to the functioning of Windows and Word that I instantly knew how to use WebPlus to get professional results.  I've included my original review of X5 below because all of it is still relevant to the X6 release.<br /><br />Original WebPLus X5 Review:<br />Definitely a FIVE STAR software!!! I was so imnpressed with Webplus X5 I just had to write a review. I am NOT a web designer, but was able to quickly and easily design a 10 page professional looking website from scratch without using any of the templates. WebPlus X5 is easy to learn - I spent less than 15 minutes with the tutorials and then dove right in. The ability to position, resize, & format text, photos, etc., and place these items exactly where and how you want them is unbelievable.<br /><br />If you are a non-designer like me and want to put a site up that looks like you've been doing it for years this is the product. You should have some familiarity with computers and some aptitude for working with software. I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't use a computer to pick this up and run with it. I would expect someone who considers themselves an intermediate user of products like Microsoft Word or Excel to be able to quickly pick-up WebPlus X5.<br /><br />Finally, it would also be helpful to have some &#34;artistic&#34; ability in order to design a decent website. There's a touch of &#34;art&#34; to putting together a page that is pleasing to the eye or &#34;eye-catching&#34;. Just slapping some mis-matched photos and clipart on a page along with some disjointed narrative and tastelessly formatted text does not result in decent webpage.<br /><br />Recapping, this product definitely can deliver anything you want it to, but your degree of success also depends on you having some basic skills: 1) some previous skill/experience with a software that uses standard menus/toolbar; & 2) a touch of &#34;artistic&#34; ability to create a pleasing page design.4;eye-catching&#34;.

1,"I am just tired of upgrades where I have to relearn things. Took a couple of days to figure out how to download data from my bank. That had changed. Then to enter data for checks done months before, the cursor goes to the top when I'm done instead of the next line. Just an annoying pain. Outside of that, it's the usual good way to keep track of money for home and business."
0,"The Download version of this software does not install, and encountered no help when calling both Nuance and Amazon for technical support.  I just lost $100.  Buyer beware."
0,Product does not perform background scan. During a full PC scan which take over an hour the PC is not functional. The product also slows down your PC significantly. Norton is my preferred product allowing quick scans and does not slow your PC.
1,Adobe does it again! This is the easiest tool I have ever used for my photography. I used to use Photoshop exclusively. Now I find myself using LR more often but still use PShop on occasion.
0,"The only reason it gets one star is there no option to choose zero stars! Save yourself the time and effort and do not buy this software. The software itself has very little functionality and is pretty much worthless. I can do more with a checkbook, or a standard Excel spreadsheet. If the software isn't bad enough, the customer service is even worse. I am still dealing with their horrible customer service trying to get a refund (their website claims a satisfaction guarantee). I would highly recommend against purchasing this software!"

Download mp3 acapellas slice the lyrics and make it part of your song. It's so fun, i don't know how to stop. Great price, the only program you will ever need. Like i said endless possibilities. All you need is your imagination."
0,"I uninstalled this and requested a refund from Intuit after upgrading from Quicken 2013.  Quicken user since late 1990s.  I was unhappy with 2014 for a number of reasons:<br />The iPhone App is a weak effort that lacks the transaction type field in the Windows application,requiring me to go back and edit transactions after adding them via iPhone.  It lists &#34;Recent Payees&#34; as three companies beginning with the letter &#34;A&#34;.<br />Reconcile issue - My credit card account was unable to balance after the upgrade, showing a difference close to the total account balance.  I could not fix this and was thus unable to balance that account.<br />Bill Reminders - As in the 2013 version, when I pay some bills via Bill Reminders, Quicken asks if this is a transaction from a prior month and of a different amount.  This should have been fixed since I am originating the transaction from a window designed to enter it in the register.<br />Memo field - As in the 2013 version, the memo field for some transactions retains information i entered in an old 2012 transaction.  I have to clear this every time.  This should have been fixed.<br />Lack of features for core functionality - For basic functions (managing a bank or credit balance and tracking retirement account transactions), there is nothing new apparent with the 2014 version.  The weekly email summary is the only change I have noticed and is a nice feature.<br /><br />Overall, Intuit has made next to no effort for what an upgrade should be - improvements, new features, and fixes to past annoyances.  I can't easily change to some other product but I won't upgrade until I am forced to.  This has been a frustrating experience."
0,"Please be careful ... this program might be good for people who know their way around the backdoors of their computers, but if you are not an expert stay away.

0,I was looking to get the current version of turbotax (having been a user of the product line since the early MacinTax days) and what I found was a marketing debacle.  On the bright side I now have an idea for how to profit from this opportunity.  Shorting INTU could provide some handsome returns I'll be filing using H&R software.
1,"FileCenter Professional is a great companion to Fujitsu ScanSoft scanners.<br /><br />I have tried different document management software to keep track of business and household documents. FileCenter Professional version 7 is the best overall software solution, in my experience.<br /><br /> 1.  Searching Content. FileCenter gives you control over whether, and when, your documents should be converted from raw scans to PDF readable and searchable text. Automated word searching is a great way to quickly locate a specific document out of many hundreds or thousands.<br /><br /> 2.  Advanced PDF operations.  FileCenter gives fine control over scanner-produced PDFs. Indeed, it offers much of the functionality of Adobe Acrobat. It's easy to assign meaningful document names and descriptions to scanned PDFs.  PDF files can be split or joined as appropriate. Individual pages can be deleted, extracted or added to any PDF file. PDF files can be moved or copied easily from one folder to another.<br /><br /> 3.  Standard Windows directories.  Unlike other document management software, FileCenter places files in standard Windows directories, meaning that your backed-up documents are always available and always organized, regardless what happens to your document management software.  There are no proprietary databases involved.<br /><br />All in all, I have found FileCenter Professional to be a very useful tool in getting rid of paper clutter."
1,"Wasn't sure if I should download after reading some of the previous reviews. I typically use Turbo Tax every year and just purchase at the store. So easy and accurate. Although I haven't done my taxes yet, I wanted to review the download process for others wondering. I did run into a glitch with downloading the state portion. My computer kept telling me that I did not have administrator privileges. I was ready to contact amazon and then just turned off computer and tried again and it worked. The one star lacking was due to this glitch otherwise looks good. Hopefully the end result will look good too. If I don't owe it will!!"

0,Intuit made me get the premium version to do my investments
0,"My experience with turbotax when filing my 2013 forms was maddening to say the least.  I tried every way  I could to get some response from the so-called experts, all to no avail.  After a month of trying to get some answers I finally sent it in incorrect and let the feds do the correction.  I was really discouraged with the total lack of back up from turbotax and this year I went ahead and used turbotax but I backed it up with a visit to the zombies (IRS) and was advised on the proper way to process the numbers so I had the right answer at the end.  Now I am hoping they (IRS) get their stuff together and send my return a little faster."
1,"Avast Antivirus Free was recommended to me by a tech support guy at work. I have been using it on several computers for about 5 years now, and have not had any problems. It even caught viruses that other programs did not. My only complaint is that they do tend to nag you to upgrade fairly often & sell you other Avast products. That is only to be expected from a free program this good, though. Overall, I have been quite satisfied with this product."
1,"Turbo Tax makes taxes easy and painless. Being able to download it straight off of Amazon made it even easier and faster. Make sure you're looking at if you're buying just the federal E-File or the State, as well."
0,"I spent three hours on this.  Repeatedly downloaded it to me MAC, which had more than enough space and the appropriate operating system.  I got passed around on the phone, when the e-mail and livechat option didn't work. Only to find out I would have to call the vender of the typing game to try and address the problem before Amazon would consider refunding my money.  Buy the hardcopy, this was NOT a time saver at all."
1,love it
1,I have used Norton for very long time . This one puts everything into one program which is nice but it is still a heavy program but it is still worth get because of the protection it gives
1,Experienced minor problems installing it. Functioning as expected without heavy use of CPU resources. Have not experienced any other problems with it.
0,"If only i could return this I would do so in a heartbeat.  After days and days of fighting with this operating system,  I finally went and put Linux back on my machine.  I never should have put windoze on in the first place!  I have been a computer tech for over twenty years and I have never had the problems that I have experienced with this operating system.  I was on the phone with Microsoft twice for hours at a time and on chat with them a couple more times to boot.  For what ever reason when I had this piece of crap on my hard drives explorer.exe kept stealing focus away from the active program making the system almost unusable.  I checked drivers, I checked BIOS settings, I reflashed the BIOS to make sure it was up to date, I reinstalled about 5 times, the &#34;tech&#34; from Microsoft installed Win10 over the top of Win10.  No luck, no resolution to the problems I was having.  What a waste of money and time.  Now I have to rebuild my system almost from scratch and I am not a happy camper.  I wouldn't want to fob this piece of junk off on to anybody.  Perhaps when its been out for a few months or years there will be sufficient driver support to get it working on my machine but I wouldnt hold my breath"
1,Always a great buy!
0,"Turbo Tax is worst than the toilet paper manufactures, they only cut back on the size of the toilet paper.  Turbo Tax increases the price and moves items (Schedule D and others) that you used to get in the Deluxe version to the Premier version."
0,"I I am using Windows 8.1 - 64 bit, installed the software and then type in the license key as it ask me to do. I turned on the program asked me again to type in the license key. That window I closed, because I already type in the license key and every time I start the program it will ask me to type in the license. I installed a virus program, then I was checking all my software, computer and the program did not start. Then I installed a program again and it told me that my license key was invalid. So I asked a friend, and if he can test this program out, and his work on his computer. Well, I am stuck with no software at this moment and do not know what to do next. I hope you do not get in the same predicament I am in, my friends. It's not what is in the program, it is the installation part that is driving me crazy how to resolve it, because I could not make it work right. Good luck, my friends."

0,"I was under the impression when I elected to purchase I was getting a complete Office Mac, i.e. Word, Excel, Power Point and Outlook. Previous Home and Student versions of Mac Home and Student did not include Outlook. When I attempted to open Outlook I received a message saying I needed an alpha/numerical key. I had received an alpha/numerical key, which worked on the Word, Excel and Power Point apps, but not on Outlook. I was not aware nor made aware in any of the documentation accompanying the download I would not be able to open Outlook with the key provided. I was either the victim of false and misleading advertising or poor follow up on the part of Amazon (providing a second key for Outlook)."

0,"Latest Upgrade of Quicken as only way to download stock prices, etc.  The 1999 Quicken was its high point; it has been down hill ever since.  Font size is my biggest problem.  The 2013 version finally had a large font option.  However, it turned out to work less well than my work-around (I have so many work-arounds on Quicken there is little left of the original app).  Without large fonts I get eye strain trying to see anything.  With large fonts things like dialog boxes drive me nuts. Today I just sold some stocks & clicked on the select lots only to discover that even this block is no longer useable.  The only way I could get out of that box was to Alt-Delete until Task Manager came up & I could close the Quicken App.  A quarter of the dialog box was off screen and there is no way to alter the screen (like category selection and many other dialog boxes).  As for instituion downloads, I quit using them about a decade ago because if there is a stock name change or some other change Quicken might not accept my changing the name.  This App might require I re-enter the entire 20 year history of that stock.  After this happening more than once I concluded I was losing mire time using automatic downloads when compared to the time lost re-entering the entire history of that stock or fund.  I could go on but I need to find still another work-around."
1,"The software, being an older version, was quite inexpensive and serves my needs perfectly. However, it is not easy to use and the &#34;help&#34; is not really helpful.  If you purchase this, consider buying a &#34;Dummies&#34; book or something similar - as you're not going to get anything useful from Adobe."
1,I chose this rating because it keeps my computer updated.<br />it has not let any thing mess with my computer
0,the Norton Utilities downloaded and installed fine but the product key for the Norton Security didn't work and Symantec support was useless
0,Was only good for and/or useful for one month
1,I am very happy with avast. It has been very easy to work with and does keep me informed. Thank you very much.
0,I guess I did not have the time to devote to watch the 23 training videos.<br /><br />It did not meet my needs....  It should be more simple.....<br /><br />I gave up and did not use it.....<br /><br />It may work for you....
1,The anti-virus just works.  Does not bog down the PC CPU.  The ability to connect and help others using the assist function is fantastic.
1,Protecting 10 computers for 5$ was. It's a good deal
1,Does its job
1,Good experience. Easy to use. I had to have this for school. It's a good program. I would recommend this to a friend.
0,I am a long time Quicken user. I heavily rely on the budget feature. I was happy with the 2010 version but know Intuit forced an update every three years. After reading through dozens of these reviews I bought the 2011 version.<br /><br />Quicken now has three years to fix this mess . After that if the budgeting isn't fixed and Imtuit won't download institution data I guess I'll stick with 2011 and manually enter quotes and other data.
1,"Having an interest in both still photography and video and having experience with Aperture, iPhoto, and iMovie, I find that both Photoshop and Premiere Elements are allowing me to go to the next level without getting into the more extensive and expensive professional programs .  While some have commented that the programs are not particularly intuitive, I disagree.  If one has any experience with other photo/video organizational and editing programs, the structure of both Photoshop and Premiere is fairly straightforward. In addition, there are many tutorials available for the complete novice.  Importing files is easy and organizing them is as simple or complex as one wants to make it.  Manipulating images and creating videos is simply a matter of playing with the many tools that are available.  Great programs and a lot of fun."
1,Its meet my expectation. I would recommend it.
0,"Family Tree Heritage is simply the LDS Personal Ancestry File (free although no longer available) and Ancestral Quest (lower in price) in disguise. In fact, when starting a new file you are given the option of opening an .aq (Ancestral Quest) or .paf (Personal Ancestry File). The interface is virtually identical to Ancestral Quest in fact the entire application is identical ti Ancestral Quest with the exception of minor changes in a few of the options such as the option of swapping the order of entry of the given names and surnames in the individual data entry window. Family Tree Heritage is published by Individual Software and Ancestral Quest is published by Incline Software. The name difference is the primary difference between the packages. The layout of the two is virtually identical and the interface options are exactly the same.<br /><br />Amazon.com sells Family Tree Heritage as a download only, a method of sale which is common nowadays for genealogical software. However, Amazon.com insists that you also download their \\""game and software downloader\\"" which you are unaware of until you reach the download screen. If you do not install their downloader you cannot download your purchased software. There are other companies who use a downloader also however the purchaser is usually aware of this and usually the downloader is dedicated to downloading only the particular application or file. Amazon.com's implementation and the inference that you will also be possibly downloading something that you do not want is questionable especially when nowadays unwanted software is piggy-backed with many downloads including Internet browsers. I will not be making another download purchase from Amazon.com and in fact am considering removing Amazon.com from my list of online retailers."
1,"This product seems to hold up to the high reviews I found as a result of extensive online research in Feb 2015. I've been happy with the results thus far. It lives up to the reviewer's claims of being lightweight on system resources and great on both detection and cleaning. I also like the simple, clean user interface which drives an intuitive, straightforward experience. The web-based account management tools are nice, too, particularly with a multi-user license. TIP: Buy from Amazon. Far less expensive."
1,"Outstanding product, and have been using it for years. However, number Amazon gives you is a sales number and not an actual product key. In order to get a product key, you must go to http://www.avg.com/registration and enter the number Amazon gives you. Follow the instructions and you will be issued a genuine product key that will work."
1,You can't beat the price i got! I trust Norton and it never disappoints me. I have no problems with my laptop since i had Norton
1,"Perfect fit for our needs. Completed in less than 2 hours, filed the same afternoon and refund deposited yesterday. No muss, no fuss."
1,"The best internet security! No issues, excellent download."
0,"I do not use every function within Quicken so I cannot say exactly if some things have been added or improved, but from what I could see, going from 2013 to 2014 was completely useless for me since I didn't notice anything new or different. Additionally, I noticed one small, but very annoying downside. Normally I have my banking site and Quicken open at the same time and switch between the two with \\""Alt+Tab\\"" combination. Now when I switch back to Quicken instead of just continuing in the field where I left off I have to actually click it since Quicken 2014 \\""forgets\\"" its last field of activity. Many years ago I used to be huge fan of Quicken, now I just use it since there is no alternative."
1,It does what Office is supposed to and its not in the cloud...
1,"We have been a Quicken user for 15 years. We moved from a PC to an iPad as our primary computing device in 2010 making it difficult to update our Quicken. With Quicken 2013 we have gained the interface we were looking for. We are still in the testing phase, but so far so good."
1,"Comes as is, nothing else added! I use it on my laptop and my mobile phone. If you're looking for something that won't slow down your internet connection, I highly recommend this one!"
0,did not do what I wanted it to do tried it did not like
1,loved it
1,The usual anti-virus products drove me crazy with interruptions and renewal demands.  Not Avast.  The product works and Avast doesn't interrupt your online work to beat on you to renew.  After using the free product for years I'm only too happy to upgrade to the full service product.  Friendly anti-virus and malware protection at last.
1,Improved
1,"Have used Norton for years, it is a good program."
0,can register only in local..<br />here is cannt input code from korea. TT<br />need VPN server..
1,"Avast is a no-frills, simple and effective product that does exactly what it states.  It is user friendly to the extent you don't need a PHD to move around within its frame-work.  It is most effective when used as recommended. I was an AVG user for many years. Since switching to Avast, my problems have been completely eliminated.  I would recommend this product to any and all users seeking a better way to be safe at your computer."
1,Quick easy to use needed it for school and the process for download could not have been move user friendly
0,"If you own and use Quicken 2007--- then don't convert. Quicken for 2015 is a major step down from the 2007 version. It is far less functional, far less intuitive and thus far less useful. Utterly mystifying why or how Quicken would release a new product that is vastly inferior to its past product."
1,Office Mac is a critical piece of software.  It contains elements which make the office complete.<br /><br />My only complaint is price - it is a bit EXPENSIVE!
0,My code does not work! I want my money back or a new code but there isn't anyone I can contact nor is there a refund button.
1,So far I am happy
0,"Read about what the Mac version doesn't support before you buy. For example, if you send an accountant's copy, you cannot continue to work until the changes are imported. Too many functions I use are not supported in this version. Hoping QuickBooks as a company will let me return this because buying it was a huge mistake. Never imagined there would be this many limitations."
1,cheap not bad
1,Great app very plesaed.
1,"Installed this as an upgrade went smooth, really like the new features"
1,Easy and quick download. Less expensive than purchasing direct from intuit and makes entry easy and helps match up with TurboTax for quick tax entry.
1,"As with all upgrades, switching from the 2004 version to the 2011 version can be fun, frustrating, &#34;Wow, look at that,&#34; or &#34;Darn, that's different,&#34; but after a month, I've discovered a lot of nice touches and improvements and few drawbacks except for my learning curve and I'm sure I have hardly scratched the surface, using MSWord most of all.<br /><br />I'm not competent enough to give a breakdown of improvements or new features except to say I like most of what I've seen so far."
1,Download and installation was painless and fast. This is an efficient way to purchase and use this software without the wait and waste of obtaining same in disc form.
1,"Complete, easy to install and use with automatic updates. Used it for years now and very pleased. Highly recommend installing on your browser."
1,Made my life easier when owning a very small business
0,"I used to be a long time Microsoft Money user and absolutely loved it.  I've been carefully managing my budgets and expenses for years and always have practiced zero based budgeting where I can move money between categories to balance and build a savings pot.  When Money was discontinued, I begrudgingly switched to Quicken 2010 and after some adjustment, got it to work very well.  I was happy and upgraded to Quicken 2011.  Life was good.  Over the weekend, I decided in the spirit of upgrades, mobility and support that I would upgrade to Quicken 2013.  I am on the go and wanted a financial management tool that I could check on my iPad etc.  I performed the upgrade and it wiped out my Quicken 2011 and &#34;upgraded seamlessly&#34;.  When I opened Quicken 2013, I was horrified.  All of my budgets that I had meticulously balanced and carryovers that I had maintained carefully were messed up and my savings pot had disappeared completely.  Also, Quicken does not allow you to balance between categories anymore and the interfaces are completely different.  Why would Quicken do this???  After trying for a few hours to figure this out, I uninstalled Quicken 2013 and luckily I had the 2011 disc and reinstalled it and can breathe a sigh of relief...  Unfortunately, Amazon has a no refund policy for Quicken 2013 so I am down $65 - but I will never again purchase another Quicken product.  Next time I will try iBank or YNAB."
0,"This is one of the most unfriendly programs I have ever used.  It seems to be geared toward GPS applications.  Does anybody really plan a trip on a PC-based program?  I am in real estate, and I simply want to make maps where I can place a star where I need it and label it &#34;Comp 1&#34; or &#34;Subject Property.&#34;  This can be done on Street Atlas 2015, but it requires numerous keystrokes and several tool changes, and the results are still disappointing.  Suppose you want to find your house on a map, place a star there, and label it &#34;Home.&#34;  Step one is to go to the &#34;Find&#34; tab to locate the property by address.  It will show you dozens of hits.  Even though the first hit was a precise match, you still have to manually select it from the list of hits.  Now the program automatically inserts a &#34;Maptag&#34; at that address, which labels the property with the street address.  But you wanted it labeled &#34;Home,&#34; not with your street address.  Unfortunately, the Maptag cannot be edited, so you must delete it, which takes three more keystrokes.  Now that you know where the property is located on the map, you must switch to the &#34;Draw&#34; tab, where there are various tools for inserting different types of symbols onto the map.  There are very few symbols available, and editing them is ridiculously complex.  You can't just choose small, medium, large.  If you want the star to be larger, you have to create one from scratch, one pixel at a time, and you are still limited to a very small symbol.  Once you settle for a symbol and drag it to the map, a text box automatically pops up to add a label to the symbol.  That label is positioned to the upper right of the symbol, and the position cannot be adjusted.  So, if you also put a star on the adjacent house and labeled it &#34;Neighbor,&#34; the labels would overlap each other.  The label is also in a transparent box, so it may not be clearly visible if there is a colored map feature at that particular spot on the map that conflicts with the color of your text.  Since the edit features for the symbol label are so lame, you can just eliminate the label by hitting enter with no text.  But you still want a label for your home, so now you must change tools to add a &#34;MapNote.&#34;  At least the MapNote is a solid box and can be oriented to point from any direction, so maybe you can point at your home from the top left and at your neighbor's home from the bottom right.  All text in the MapNote must be on a single line, so don't plan on adding too long of a description.  The default position for the MapNote is again upper right of where you place it.  You can drag it to a different orientation, but you must switch to another tool to do this.  Similarly, if you want to edit the text in the MapNote, you need to switch tools again.  I hope you are getting the picture of how freaking difficult it is to simply put a star at your house and label it &#34;Home.&#34;  Nearly everything you might want to accomplish with a map program is possible with Street Atlas, but even the simplest of tasks becomes complex and time-consuming.  The Help functions do nothing to simplify the process and simply regurgitate the instructions that pop up when you hover over a symbol or task button.  Until recently, I used a version of DeLorme that was about 20 years old.  It was extremely easy to use, and I miss it dearly.  Unfortunately, many roads have been built since then, so the underlying maps became obsolete, but it was so much easier to do what I wanted to do.  I have tried several version of Street Atlas over the years, but each is less friendly than the last, so I kept reverting to the old standard for as long as possible.  My business partner would tease me because my printed maps showed a copyright date of 1996.  Now my maps have a current date, but I spending a couple hours per week on a task that used to consume just a few minutes per week."
1,"I've been using 360 for several years and always renew thru Amazon online.  If you need to add to another computer, you can download it from Amazon again or from Symantec and use your key code to activate."
1,good value
1,It helped my old laptop get back to normal.
1,Easy to install and great price.  It's way cheaper than other store. I will probably buy it again next year
1,Amazing product. Easy to use and understand.  simple to download. I would buy this product again and recommend it to others.
0,I realized too late that I should have chosen a different set up in order to enter transactions manually rather than downloading from my bank. I can't figure out how to go back and re-do. Quicken support is not helpful.
0,the cubes fill the bill--I will use them in so many areas.  they make things look neat and organized.  The bed-- I had to return it--it was scratched in more than one  area -- finish missing in other areas.---the memory foam mattress is in guest bedroom and everyone says it is fine as is the cover for the mattress  and the bed foundation.  The Norton was fine but the outfit  was not Amazon--evidently  they were selling on Amazon and over charged my credit card--I had to spend  quite a bit of time on the phone with Symantec and they fixed the problem.
1,Great for standard deduction and pretty straight forward taxes. Yes they have the online help... But sometimes when things get complicated you just need an accountant.
1,"I downloaded the mac version to my new iMac running mountain lion (10.8.2). No problems with the download or the installation. Everything went smoothly and I am a technological idiot, so if I can do it, anybody can do it. The software has a bit of a learning curve, but offers way more possibilities than iPhoto."
1,I would recommend avast free antivirus to everyone and anyone. Very easy to use. I would rate it as 5 star.<br />5 star
1,Very good filing method to use and very accurate. I have been using Turbo Tax for the past seven years and I would no change. It brings to my attentions items to cosider for deductions that I might would miss.
1,Love a lot of the new features and have been using the 2010 version for the past 5 years. It has a bit too much stuff actually but that's not bad.
1,"I actually simplified down from the business version this year and the Deluxe version imported many of the schedule C/D/E calculations from the previous year.  It didn't actually process those as the original specific categories but the few non-standard income, expenses and depreciation did carry forward as 'other' so none of the left over stuff was lost.<br /><br />Filing for the business has always been relatively easy even if it did produce a 27-page return... but using TurboTax for a more 'normal' return was quick, easy and accurate."
1,Works great.  Easy to follow the procedure.
1,Inexpensive and easy to use
0,Liars!  Horrible software.  They said that I could &#34;easily&#34; transfer my company data from Sage Peachtree.  I downloaded the tool and when I did it gave me an error and 1-800 number.  I call it and the barely understandable man told me it can be transferred for FIFTY DOLLARS!  What?!?!?!  Horrible promises and now I will return the product and just stick with peachtree.
0,"I really like Quickbooks and associated payroll software. It works, it's solid - that part gets 5 stars. I have QB2013 with enhanced payroll subscription for 1 year. So I bought 2014 thinking that it is simply a license update that would refresh my payroll for another year. This is how most other software packages work. But now I discover I'll likely spend half a day on the phone getting it installed. Yuck. Wasting my time reduces the rating to 1 star."
1,"I get it, I get it....a lot of people are really mad out there and probably rightfully so! Intuit did not manage or communicate the recent changes very well to their customers. That being said, my tax situation is pretty simple and my family does not need those additional forms that everyone is all mad about so using Turbo Tax this year was as easy as ever for me. Got a nice return for both Federal & State and the program walked me through every step. Think this is at least the 10th year in a row I have used Turbo Tax and I plan on using it again next year."
1,Great price on Quicken through Amazon and I especially liked being able to download immediately.  Good to have the Amazon repository to download again if I need to.
0,"I have used Turbo Tax for years to do my personal taxes and Schedule C for contract work.  I incorporated last year and tried this software for my business return, it is uninformative and vague and does not explain things well.  Most hints are a generic sentence that requires further investigation.<br /><br />I shelled out the extra 54 bucks to file my state taxes and that was a waste.  That portion of the software is incomplete and frustrating to use.  There are no tabs to skip to a section so while trying to fix one error I had to keep going through the entire state return to get back to the review to see if it was okay.  Items I had previously checked were no longer checked like they usually are in turbo tax returns.<br /><br />If you know what you are doing I'm sure it is easier to use but for an incorporated noob it is a bit of a struggle."
0,"Intuit has very poor customer service.  Our QuickBooks would not let us login so we called customer service.  After 4 hours he fixed it but told me if I upgraded to a higher level for $1700.00 I would not have this problem so I paid for it over the phone and he was to call me back the next day to install the next level of QB.  He never called the next day, I called customer service back and they told me I didn't need the next level and that the salesman scanned me ( the customer service reps exact words about his fellow rep).  Scanned Me!!! He put his supervisor on the phone and she told me she was issuing a refund.  Meanwhile QB stopped working again the next day.  Was on the phone for 5 hours that day only to end up hiring an IT guy on my own to come fix my QB.  A week later I called because I never received my refund only to find out they never processed the refund.  So, I was scanned, still have not received my refund, and I had to hire an IT guy to fix my QuickBooks.  Very poor customer service."
0,Dissatisfied for the reasons others have stated.
1,"This was a great purchase, I need to update my Microsoft office. I find the new product a bit more complicated to use than office 2010"
1,"This is a great alternative to the old software purchase and install model. Above all, the program installation and execution is flawless, which makes for worry-free process. Also, it is best to pay $99/year for the latest office version than to pay hundreds of dollars for the complete set of programs. Highly recommended!!"
0,We have been a quicken customer for many years....the 2015 issue finally pulled the plug for us. We are finished with quicken and hope they fix their problems but it's not worth it anymore.
0,Program was downloaded so had it immediately but ......................As usual Quickbooks has NOTHING to offer in their new addition.  They did however manage to make it much harder to use and they were able to hide many features that I use everyday so I had to spend many hours trying to do what I could previously do in a few seconds.  I was forced to upgrade in order to be able to continue emailing invoices.  The best version of Quickbooks was the very first one they put out.  With each new addition it just get harder and harder to use.
1,[[VIDEOID:mo3T5UWHIPDSN7Q]]Bought a new HD camcorder only to find that none of my existing video software woul recognize the MBT file format the camera produces.  The provided software that comes with the camera is awkward to use and edit.  Tried the trial version of Movavi and had no problem in converting to any of the usual file formats that can be edited with existing software.
1,I love TurboTax.  It is an easy program to use. I've tried others but TurboTax is my favorite.
0,This product abended each of the three times I tried to use it - on the first transaction I tried to enter! I would recommend using paper and pencil over this product.
0,"I've been designing shoes as a contractor for 14 years...before that, worked for a large manufacturer...and have always used illustrator.  BUT, I purchased every other update to stay current.

There are alternatives out there...I'll learn about them and make my decision in a year or two until then, it'll be CS6 for me. No more subscriptions and no additional frivolous costs, at least for me."
1,I have been using avast! Free edition on my home computers for about 10 years. I found it easy to use and very effective at blocking viruses and other malware. I would highly recommend it to anyone else for personal home use.
1,I have used TurboTax for many years now.  I find the software very user friendly and fast in performing my taxes each year.  I am confident that the results are correct and will pass any IRS questions.  I wouldn't use any other tax programs that are available.
0,"Turbotax STINKS! I used it for decades. This last year. they got greedy and started removing features from the basic software package. So, no more Schedules C or D. On top of that, if you use their online service, it's virtually impossible to go back and correct items that you might have entered incorrect data for. Never going to pay these turds my hard earned cash again."
0,This product will not download onto my PC Windows 8 like the previous version did as well as my other digital downloads.  There are no direct line to getting help in downloading other than the little box at the bottom of the screen which does nothing.
0,have several brokerage accounts...when i added all the 1099s the whole software became soon slow it became unusable to complete my return..
1,I have been using Norton internet protection software for 5 years now and I am extremely pleased with their products.  I once had a trojan virus attack my computer and Norton was able to identify the extremely hard to find virus and delete all of its components.  Customer service gets a little dicey as they have outsourced to other countries but all of my issues have all been resolved in the end so no complaints.
0,unlike other software you can shut down and install on another unit that's not an option with Pinnacle. this software takes a monster of a computer and graphics card to operate Windows Media Player is free works better.<br /><br />I feel like I was ripped off and I've bought 3 of the other versions that are a beat down to try to use for upgrades - do not recommend at all
0,Don't just assume that just because you check to make sure your computer is compatible that it will be.  I checked installed this and it don't work.  It shows half the game so impossible to play.  Then I realize it says no returns so do yourself a favor and don't waste hard earned money on this mess.
1,THE. BEST. ANTI-VIRUS. EVER. HANDS DOWN. PERIOD. DONE. END OF CONVERSATION. I only use their free version and it has saved my computers and androids more once. It makes it very easy to see the status of all your devices.
0,"I have the same issues with the business forms as other users - namely that the Business crashes on 1120-S forms at a certain point. I've used this program since 2005 when it was called Taxcut, and while the business program hasn't been improved, or changed at all in that time, it did work in previous years (with some judicious use of \\""whole form\\"" filling out). It never has had e-file, though. They've always been slow to get up the state S-corp forms as well, but I can handle waiting until mid-february for that. What I can't handle is crashing with no fix in sight and a March 15 deadline. I'm purchasing Turbotax business right now, which does at least support e-file (although it is triple the price). Looks like you get what you pay for, but it seems like it is going to be turbotax for me from now on, period."
0,"this program did not stop problems that my computer is having ,even though it should have taken care of it."
1,been using avast for about 5 months and its great
0,Each account is either so small I can't read it or too Large I only see part of the page.  At start up I get an error message that Quicken does not &#34;Run as Administrator.&#34;  I have tried everything to accomodate this error message to no avail.  HELP
0,"If you want software that says error report every time you try and use it, than this is for you. I have never had any kind of software that I could not get to work. I have deleted it off my computer, re-downloaded it, and so on. Nothing works. Just keeps saying error report!!"
0,"It doesn't install well, a lot of errors in the software.  My daughter didn't like it.  It ended up being a waste of money."
1,it helped me do a long hard job with Social Security  Income and jibs income and a rented home for incomes and a fast refund from the IRS and NY State
1,"It is really as good as MS Office except it doesn't have a little more bells and whistles. For basic and presentable office work, this is great aside from it  is free."
1,"Didn't slow my computer like Norton did, Norton had my computer doing some crazy things. I would highly recommend McAfee to anyone."
1,"I had to buy this as my earlier version (2004?) stopped working with downloads from my financial institutions -- wouldn't update my accounts. Got a \\""to you so\\"" message from Intuit, which I didn't appreciate, but I was stuck and had to update. This version works no better than the old version, or even the first version for that matter, at least for my limited needs (essentially an electronic checkbook register). That said, it works very well. So, my recommendation is not to upgrade Quicken unless you have to, but if you do, this is good software."
1,"Won't leave home without it..  have Norton on 5 computers, 2 tablets and 3 smart phones.  Been using Norton for almost 25 years and have never gotten a virus or anything else on anything ! !"
1,I have had no viruses since I have used this product for 2 years. It removes all unwanted spyware and viruses automatically and then tell me at the end of the month what it has done. Great product.
1,"Had some trouble installing, but after about 10 minutes installed great.  This is a great product would recommend it for your laptop or desktop."
1,"I can understand the negativity around TurboTax and Intuit's decision to separate the versions, and I was considering switching to H&R Block. They messed up, but then recognized their error, and are now offering $25 back if you filed last year with deluxe and had to use premier this year. This paired along with the amazon prime sale resulted in me paying less than I did with deluxe last year!    Note that Etrade may not report the actual cost basis for RSUs and other stock grants, and you may have to calculate that yourself. It would be nice if TurboTax pointed this out in a note, or aided somehow in calculation.    EDIT: Just got my $25 check from them, in about a week after filing and using their online form to get the 25 back."
1,"Quickbooks makes managing our small business easy and fast. I appreciate how easy it is to do daily transactions and the informative graphs and reports that let me see at a glance, how our business is doing. Also, the built in \\""Helps\\"" makes it convenient if I have a problem with processing a transaction."
1,Replaced MS Money with this after 7 years using MS Money.  Meet expectations.  Easy to build and use.  Affordable.  Mobile apps.
1,"don't Be fooled by the other reviews and pass this offer up. I myself thought twice when I saw all of the complaints about installation. But I couldn't afford to or want to pay to have it shipped so i took a chance figuring I could get a refund anyway if it didn't workout. And like most of the others installation didn't go smoothly. I had to call amazon. No lie the rep told me what to do, I did it (very simple anyone can do it) and finished my installation. Hence why even though I had to call I gave it 5 stars."
1,"The people who had issues with registration probably did not read the directions carefully enough. Amazon provides you a link, you go to the link, enter your information, they email you the code. It easily took less than five minutes. It was even easier than when I bought the physical copy of CS4. If you have a student email account, you should have no problem at all."
1,Great deal; I am using the software without hassle so far.
1,I've been using Excel for as long as it's been put. Each upgrade has been better then the last.  Love this product.
1,"Well, it's Norton 360.  It has always worked well for me.<br /><br />This review is really about the cost savings of using Amazon's digital download service.  Lets face it, when you buy 360, you are buying a subscription for their service.  Buy it on Amazon for LESS THAN HALF of what Norton wants for it retail or via &#34;auto renewal&#34;  While auto renewal is very convenient, it is generally the MOST expensive way to go.  And, once auto renewal is set up, it is nearly impossible to stop.  Last time, the renewed it a week early and I invested a couple hours getting a refund.  Just easier to never give Norton you credit card info.<br /><br />I just un-installed Norton 360. Then ran the Norton 360 removal tool to assure a clean install.  Then downloaded new copy from Amazon for a lot less money.<br /><br />If your moral compass will allow, you can get a extra 30 days out of Norton by downloading a trial copy from Norton, and follow the above instructions when it expires."
1,I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to AVAST by my son several years ago. My computers have been protected by them for over 5 years and have been protected from several viruses. I would highly recommend this product. The programming think tank behind this product has to be full of visionary individuals! I for one am very thankful for this product.
0,good for viruses but did not catch search donkey. i had to purchase another program for malware..  :(
1,"Easy to follow software.  I hate that the state filing isn't free.  All of my kids qualify for free federal and state filing due to their income level but I cannot use my turbotax program to do so.  I have to efile the federal and then print out the state return and mail it in.  There should be a provision for low income filing that you can file the state for free as well.  They could just use TurboTax online and do it for free anyway, why not make it easier on the low income filers who qualify for free state anyway."
1,works good but could not get work probably with windows 8.1
1,Worked nicely
0,After the positive reviews I decided to download - It immediately slowed down my computer but I did run it. Did not do much at all for the dozens of virus and malware I had - afterward I ran Stopzilla which still found 73 high alert malware and at least quarantined them. I uninstalled it and my computer seemed fine... I tried a second time to give it a chance but immediately slowed down. Didn't work for me at all. However I acknowledge I may have powerful malware because I bought Bitdefender afterward which still did not fix my problem.
0,"The biggest thing that attracted me to purchasing this program was the Proxy Server they provide. It allows private and secure browsing while I travel. Like all proxy servers there is a bit of a delay but the problem comes with the Avast Secure Browser locks up and tells you to either kill the page or wait, this happens with just about every page I go to. It makes the product worthless to me and if Avast is going to provide an average of half ass product then no need to buy, just download the free antivirus and clean your browser with CCleaner."
0,"Quicken which, at one time, was a company that stood for quality and customer service has morphed into a buggy piece of software with almost no support.  What a shame...  2014 is slow and filled with problems.  It seems that intuit has taken the stance that they will make more money by cutting support and doing little development.  I have used quicken since the 1980s...the last 3 years have seen a sharp decline.  There is NO phone support...only chat support.  If you search online, you will see how many problems the product has.  Don't buy if you have other choices."
0,"I have not been able to get this to install using Win7 Pro.  I have disabled all firewall and adblock and pop-up software and continue to get error message NTWK_413, which means something is wrong with the network connection.  I am downloading stuff all the time and have never had this problem before."
0,"Does what it says, but don't expect too much support from Turbo Tax"
0,"Very good tax program in past years, except that this year they eliminated several important features that I rely on and can't complete my tax return(dividends, schedule C for consulting etc). They say that next year I will have to pay 50% more for a premium version.  Think I will try H&R Block next year. Pretty shoddy treatment for a long time customer."
1,"I started with it when it was Kiplinger's Tax Cut back in 1997, and it's been great all along, getting me the most savings and money back (if possible).  Great Software"
0,"The promised automatic download of TurboTax Premier with purchase of TurboTax Deluxe for returning customers didn't happen for me.  It's become a huge ordeal to try to get the automatic upgrade from Deluxe to Premier and still I don't have Premier. Intuit, you are going to lose even more customers over last year's debacle because your promise to provide the free upgrade is not working either."
1,"I started using Quicken Deluxe in 1997 and have been using quicken products ever since. I downgraded to the Quicken Starter 2008 Edition because I didn’t need all the other features in the deluxe version. I would recommend Quicken Starter Edition to everyone who does simple banking. It has been a financial life saver for me. I am able to see my account in real time what I have spent, my balance, and I am able to keep my check book balanced without worrying about where, what, and how much I spent days ago. It is all current on my account. I great piece of software. However, I have one sour grape with Quicken. Every new edition they produce is not compatible with the previous edition with the exception of the hig- end versions, but the majority of us aren’t investors so we don’t need all those high-end features. You can’t use your data files from the old edition in the new edition.  I have the Deluxe Edition from 97, the Starter Edition 2008, 2011 NONE of the data can be used in either edition. To add to that problem the Deluxe 1997 edition can’t be installed on Windows 7. So any financial data I need prior to 2000 I can’t research.  Now with that said, would I recommend Quicken yes, just be prepared to pay for patches (if there is one) that will allow the new edition to read the data files from the old edition. Which should be included in the new edition anyway. Any product that will save me from having to pay those outrageous bank fees is worth it."
1,"Had some issues with the Michigan state return regarding additions and subtractions from state return, that tech support wasn't able to help me with."
1,"I don't recommend using the mobile version because it doesn't show the daily register like the desktop version does. Otherwise, the desktop version is great for me. I've been using this program for over 10 years."
1,love using turbo tax and will continue to us the product.
1,"I first purchased and installed &#34;avast! Internet Security&#34; last year when I felt like it would improve my connection.  To my surprise, it did!  Sure it may be a tad expensive (then again, aren't ALL Internet Security software titles like this expensive?), but it was worth every penny."
0,Didn't like it
1,"I like this program. I think it's a good solid drawing tool. I wouldn't recommend it for someone that is looking for Photoshop or some other really expensive professional drawing program because it simply doesn't have those types of plugins, however it delivers what it says it does and if you're an artist or someone that just wants to draw with a program on their computer, buy it. It's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to do."
1,I prefer Norton and thought I would try a download this time.  This was easy to install and the quality is excellent as I expect from both Norton and Amazon and neither disappoints.
0,"I have used Quicken for years, and most recently have been using Quicken 2010 with very few problems. I received this \\""big deal\\"" offer to upgrade to 2012 and save mucho $$$, but after reading the mostly dismal reviews of Q 2012 here on Amazon, I've decided to pass on this new version. The old adage -- if it's not broken, don't fix it -- applies here. As another reviewer suggests, maybe Quicken will get the message and put out a better product next time."
1,Great product.  I have installed this product on 300+ machines.  Had to use the services ten times and recovered nine laptops and tracking one that's in Mexico City right now.
1,"I have tried many different tax packages, and they all have limitations.  I have used H&R Block now for years without issue, and each year it gets a little better.  My primary complaints are:<br /><br />1.  When you have an error, it is sometimes difficult to see exactly what caused it.  On occasion, I have entered &#34;0&#34; on a line I should not have touched and this has required that I delete an entire form to move past the error.<br /><br />2.  Navigation and searching after the wizard steps is often clunky.<br /><br />3.  The user interface is stale.<br /><br />In spite of this, the wizard interface is very easy, the ability to bring forward previous year's returns saves hours of data entry, and overall the package is very easy.  If you have a small business or a part-time consultancy, this package is very helpful.  If they could resolve the usability issues I would give it an unqualified five stars."
1,The download was easy.  It really cleaned up our computer.  Now it is running great!!
1,"Software provides what I wanted.<br /><br />The dowmload process, however, was a major, major undertaking. It required several calls to Amazon, to Microsoft and more to get a real person to assist in the download. It was a tiresome process.  It was far from being user friendly"
0,"Bit Defender has long had a reputation as one of the better antivirus programs.<br /><br />From my personal experience with this version that is no longer the case.<br />This antivirus is heavy! Updates hog enough resources that browsing with any internet browser is impossible. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera all slow to a crawl. I have never had an antivirus program run so heavy!<br /><br />Add to that the \\""silent update.\\"" On the surface, a silent update sounds like a good idea. I wouldn't call it silent. You can definitely tell when Bit Defender updates as every other program becomes unresponsive.<br /><br />There is the option to prompt for updates. Unfortunately that choice does not get saved. Bit Defender has switched back to silent update three times now without any input or message.<br />One of my privacy cleaners has been effected also. It now takes immensely longer for the cleaner to clear items that took a mere minute before.<br /><br />I am returning to what I used before Bit Defender. Kaspersky.<br />I had no problems with resource usage or changed settings with that program!<br />Buyer beware with Bit Defender Antivirus Plus!"
1,i'ts what I needed for a class
0,Like every &#34;free trial&#34; you must pay to get the full benefit of the software...
1,"It's a great product but I am still kinda confused with the database driven approach. That is not the programs fault though, I love that it doesn't create it's own weird closed database (a la iPhoto), it's fast and integrates very well with the rest of the CS suite.<br /><br />Overall, great software at a good student price."
0,"I thought it might save me time by entering transactions via phone. I tried once. It didn't work. Haven't tried again.<br />Won't print address on selected envelopes.<br />Other functions seem to work well, for me"
1,Great software. Plenty of coverage especially for a free download. I highly recommend this product to all my friends. I will continue to use Avast!
1,It's a very user friendly program. Easy to create the various documents you need. Tons of pre-made templates for you to use
0,I didnt like this software. I bought it thinking it would work for what i wanted. I had a really hard time understanding it. I dont know if it was just me or what but I prefer to do mine online on their hr block website. that is what i ended up doing too.
1,Works great. Lots of upgrades. Would still like to see better access to online banking with other banks. Some banks work with quicken but not quickbooks.
1,This is one great product. There are so many things that can be done with 9 that you cant with the previous ones. Being able to use this software with my Nikon 3100 camera was the main thing. Using the software is a snap. Thanks for a great software.
0,"Its almost impossible to get anything done with this office suite on the mac because of the frequent hangs, crashes, and just plain bugs.  The point of an office suite is to communicate words and figures as quickly and good looking as possible, and instead I'm treated to hours of fiddling as the program crashes or decides to reformat or even delete entire sections.<br /><br />The only reason to even use Office on the Mac is to collaborate with other people using these tools on Windows, and that's impossible when most of the Windows documents people send me make MS Word for Mac crash."
0,"I purchased Quicken 2013 because the 2010 version was not working well.  I had had very little problem with the 2010 version, but the 2013 version gave me problems from the very start.  I had trouble downloading transactions from my financial institution that I had never had a problem with before.  The \\""update\\"" screen told me I had the wrong password, but when I re-entered the password twice, then the financial institution locked my account.  After contacting my financial instition and getting access again, the same thing happened when I tried to run the update.  When I contacted Intuit, I got an email that referred me to a webpage with a number of options to try.  One told me to download my transactions as a \\""qif\\"" file and then \\""import\\"" them into Quicken.  I downloaded the transactions as a \\""qif\\"" file, but when I tried to import that file into Quicken, I got an error message saying that \\""qif\\"" files do not work with checking accounts.  I quit in frustration and came back to the problem after cooling of for a couple of weeks.  Today, I was finally able to get the transactions updated by going to the financial institution website and asking them to download the files into Quicken.  I know that I should have done this much earlier now, but I thought I was following the instructions I received from Intuit.  I'm sorry that I paid the money to upgrade to Quicken 2013 without reading the reviews from other persons.  Perhaps I've learned a lesson."
1,I've owned a few antivirus software over the years and avast! is the best by far. It doesn't slow my computer down and it picks up viruses that another big name brand didn't catch. Even the free version is quite powerful. I highly recommend this antivirus program.
1,Have not had a problem with this product and have not had any problems with the hacking of any of my sites
0,"I have used TurboTax since the early 1990s, when it was a DOS program, and have faithfully bought the Basic version (about $30) every year since then. While it didn't have all the Help features provided in more expensive versions, it did have all the forms, and I was happier entering data directly to the forms than going through cumbersome interviews. And if I needed help, the IRS has plenty of it online.<br /><br />No longer! TurboTax in effect has attached one schedule to each of its softwares. Basic is now limited to 1040A or 1040-EZ filers; if you have the long-form 1040, you must upgrade to Deluxe at twice or three times the price. And Deluxe doesn't have Schedule B! So if you have interest or dividend income, you must move up to Premier -- and Premier doesn't have Schedule C, so you have to buy Home & Business for ninety bucks.<br /><br />Not for me. After nearly twenty years, I'm switching to H&R Block, which imports all TurboTax data, and which provides all forms and schedules in each of its softwares."
0,"I've used Quicken for years and think overall it gets the job done ok.  Yet I often marvel at the changes that they make to this program and wonder how it gets past any kind of testing.<br /><br />Currently my number one complaint is that when you go to download transactions to your register, if you hover the mouse for a second over any transaction a pop-up window comes up to describe the transaction.  This pop-up lasts for 3 seconds and prevents you from using the register during that time.  Its ridiculous.  Whoever thought this was a good idea needs a punch in the back of the head."
1,"I have been using this software for about 5 years. This latest version is the best ever. I am a project manager and I there are over 50 (yes, *50*) projects in my portfolio. Each project is unique, and of course for each project there are many activities occurring at any time that are specific to that project.<br /><br />I discovered CP Notebook when I got started using the organization methodology known as &#34;Getting Things Done&#34; (GTD). It took some time at the start but I have fully assimilated that part of the method where one gets the details out of their head and into a &#34;trusted medium&#34;. I have not fully subscribed to that part of GTD that works with categorization and such - just too much extra effort.<br /><br />The trusted medium that I chose 5 years ago is this product. The features allow me to easily record project progress and related info quickly and safely. I have never lost information and I can recall what I wrote for project meeting or other related notes on the day/hour they occurred. I can literally go back now 5 years and provide contemporaneous information for a project on that date. How useful/powerful is that?<br /><br />So for my particular job I can not imaging being successful without this software. I have tried others (OneNote, and one/two of the Mac OS based competitors - one of which no longer exists). This one won out. The others are too cumbersome and do not have the rich feature set.<br /><br />There is also a mobile version however for my purposes I have not found that it works because of the volumes of info I need to record. It may just be me, and working on an older version iPad (less CPU horsepower), I have not developed quick software keyboard typing skills, and carrying a keyboard with the iPad... well why not just take the laptop instead - which I do.<br /><br />If you use a Mac for work, and need to record AND RECALL details as I do it can't hurt to check this out. I believe CP still provides a 30-day trial. I highly recommend this software, CP's support staff and what I have experienced as the company's obvious dedication to the future of the product."
1,This product performs more than expected well on creation of American viruses to thwart invading creations with warning at least of disposal at best.
0,"I installed this on my Mac (OS X version 10.8.2) and I can't get past the home office deduction. It crashes every time I try to enter information for my home office.  The first time it crashed I lost quite a bit of data that I spent hours entering, so since then I have been hitting &#34;Save&#34; after every screen.  Still, I can't seem to get past the home office part.  I guess I am going to have to call them and ask for a refund unless they can provide an update that will fix this problem so that I can actually complete my return."
0,It's taxes.. what's to love?!
0,"OK I'm tech savvy but it took me a while to figure out how to install this one.<br />Account that I created on microsoft was not active on the day and had to wait a while to use it.<br />This product is only usable while you have internet access.<br />If you have no internet, you can't use Word, Excel, Powerpoint e.t.c.<br />This must be clearly stated on top of product description."
0,"I've been trying to do my taxes, enter in a few things.....<br />What amazes me is after using Quicken for ten years, Quicken's a mess, this works....sort of...<br /><br />It's mind boggling how tedious and cumbersome entering information, tab tab tab tab tab (there's about 8 of these in each transaction) start typing.... BINK! sorry you didn't do something right. OK.Done return, next transaction. BINK! sorry you didn't do something right.....<br />If you loved Quicken in 1995 and have been in a coma since--you'll think it's still 1995.<br /><br />I tried to run categories for taxable items. The step prompts for this report are a joke.<br />In the window to select which categories to include, the prompt actually asks you to SELECT THE ONES YOU DON\\""T WANT!?? Whoever designed this never saw anyone else use it.<br /><br />I went through this nonsense three times. The first time I selected the report for taxes. I got a vague summary that wasn't at all relevant. The second time I made a custom report and printed out 11 pages of itemized entertainment, personal, drawing, pet....<br />The third time I figured out the EXCEPT nonsense, did everything else the same (so I think) and got two pages of summaries.<br /><br />I'll bet someone could make a billion dollars if they wrote a simple checkbook program that actually worked."
1,Love the font package. I use them almost daily.
1,Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe is misleading. I have been using Turbo tax for the past 4 years and this years 2014 hides areas of the deductions and income from you unless you accept their offer to upgrade to Business version even if you do not need it.  This is misleading and very unprofessional.  be careful before you make your decision on this.
0,"Without Schedule  D,  I'm out after 20+ years !!! Big mistake TurboTax."
1,"I have used this tax software for years, long before H&R Block purchased it. It has always been current, accurate & complete."
0,This product is now USELESS for millions of TurboTax and Intuit customers. Time to look for alternatives.
1,I'm new to Lightroom and it takes a little getting used to when coming from Photoshop. It's a frustrating learning period as lightroom does things a little differently but have come to find it an invaluable tool for editing. I also love that it never changes the original file (which I hated at first) and you &#34;export&#34; the altered images and original is never changed. Great product!
1,Good product for free.
1,Every PC needs some kind of protection.  Norton has been on my PCs for years and I have never had a problem with it.
0,This destroyed my PC.
0,"I have had nothing by problems with this beginning with the download. Sometimes it syncs with the Cloud, sometimes it doesn't. Same as syncing with mobile app. I tell it which accounts to show in my mobile and they keep changing from day to day. Don't know why Intuit can't get their act together and work out the bugs for an expensive program. This was money wasted!!"
1,"Great, easy to use interface as always.<br /><br />Pros: Online Discount<br />  Free State<br />  5 Free E-files<br />  Very strong Support<br />  Very easy Information processing<br /><br />Cons: Cost more than free<br />  Some errors in data transfer from easy guide to forms<br /><br />Sometimes when you get into complicated sections such as itemized deductions the program has hick ups.<br />Such as: Sometime on error check the program wants to input vehicle where there is none so you have to input one and then remove it in order for the program to adjust.<br /><br />My advice for using turbo tax the best would be, do your taxes twice. Once to figure out what all to input then when you are certain start over and input everything correctly the first time."
1,"Laptop seems to run faster already, plan on upgrading to full virus protection software."
1,Easy transition from older versions.  Much more user friendly.
1,I'm a TurboTax convert due to their new pricing structure.  I like this one better!  It picked up last year's data perfectly with one click.  Stock carryover was done automatically.  Human factors are excellent.  I will use H&R Block in the future.
1,"If youo are not a every day user, this is perfect for you.<br />Easy to use, all essentials are included."
0,"The softeare needs lots of improvement. It takes a very long time to calculate the returns that during my first try, I though the computer froze. When eventually it finished calculation and found some errors, it showed me the wrong form. It was after sometime I finally located the error, at which point I almost gave up. I called the support center no one answered, I left a message with my phone number - was on Wednesday April 30th, today is May 2, still no one has called me. Thank God I was able to locate the error myself and ssubmitted the returns. The US version for filing the US returns(I once lived in the US) is way far better than this."
1,after i got right code key went fine
1,Disable any firewalls and download Amazon software program
1,it tends to mess up my computer

0,"Never felt compelled to write a review, but I have to with this one.  I have always loved Quicken, but now I'm nervous to use it.  Too many bugs, for basic, common functionality.  Entering a bill off of a bill reminder?  Watch to make sure it shows as paid.  It might mysteriously go missing.  I only discovered that after wondering why I suddenly had $400 less that what I thought.  Reconciling?  I've shown a delta between my online balance and my register balance, only to find that if I close and reopen, the delta is gone.  Or vice-versa.  I've gone through one update already.  We'll see if they can get it right with another update.  Watch out."
0,"You cannot simply pay for software without setting up a Microsoft Account which they then sell to everyone including NSA. You pay for something, no refunds, and you cannot even download it without giving up all privacy. NEVER again will I buy anything. Never got it. Money is obviously not enough. Total fraud. No refund and no choice. You either walk away from the product losing what you paid or you surrender to constant spam. No choice."
1,Easy to use.  Good value
1,"This program is for the amateur enthusiast who is not looking to create detailed framing plans for decks, rather it is for creating and viewing spaces and landscape layouts. It's tools are towards general concepts of homes, decks and other outdoor living in terms of space planning.<br />If you need something to create detailed \\""construction documents\\"" you will need Home Designer Pro where you then have manual control of framing and roof design elements (one always gets what they pay for). But if you just need to see how things will fit and look, this one is for you."
0,Intuit  now requires you to go online to print from the Mac version of this product. That means they are taking a copy of your return and processing it on their server. The reason I buy the download rather than processing online is to keep my tax data off of the Intuit server! There is something VERY fishy about this change!!!
1,Good protect not on the download section of amazon took a while to finally figure out how to activate the protect. Only reason I rate 4 stars make sure that you have a avg account and wait a period of time.
1,I like it because it does what it is supposed to do.  It protects my computers without being a resource hog and slowing them down.
0,"Displays a blank page at the Wages and Income section, rendering the product completely useless. I tried it on two different computers - same result."
1,"This review is referencing the verification of the Student/Teacher edition. There are millions of words written reviewing the product itself.    I wanted to take the time to write out this review to encourage any prospective buyers that the verification process could not be more easy, provided you take a couple seconds to research the process. Adobe uses a company called Identit-E to assist in verifying people are qualified to purchase the Student/Teacher editions.    Getting verified is as simple as this:    1. Visit the identit-E website for Adobe products: [...]  2. Fill out your basic contact information, including the info on your institution  3. Using the Product Code provided to you by Amazon when you purchase the software, fill in the appropriate box on the form.  4. Identit-E will then provide you with your serial number. Save it in Evernote or wherever you keep your reference file.    That's it. I don't know why some of the other people writing reviews here had so much difficulty. Perhaps Adobe has since updated the verification process to its current form.    Good luck!"
0,"Horrible.  I bought Quickbooks Pro 2015 a couple hours ago and am already regretting it.  I've used financial software since 1998, first with MS Money.  I died a little inside when Microsoft announced they were stopping the only decent product they ever made.  Since about 2006 I've been looking around for a replacement.  For personal stuff I still use Moneydance.  It's free.  It syncs with my banks.  It's awesome.  For my business however I needed a better way to keep track of my clients, how much they owe, etc.  QB Pro 2015 ain't it.    Just two things that have frustrated me in the first couple of hours:    1. The interface is absolutely god awful.  It's slow.  It's cluttered.  And the work flows don't make any sense.  Don't even get me started on importing transactions into your bank accounts......the wizard for doing that makes the entire process mind numblingly slow.    2. Splitting transactions.  I got some transactions in and then went over to the customer screen to see how much had been paid etc.  As I was looking over the list, certain clients were missing entries that I know I had put in.  So I went to the check register.  Sure enough, there they were.  The problem was that the transactions were part of a credit card batch.  In order to account for them all I had done a split on the transaction and filled in each name, how much they paid etc.  It showed up in the check register just fine, but the morons at Intuit didn't setup the program to assign the transaction to a category.  So even though the transaction is split between John Doe 1, John Doe 2, etc in the check register, it doesn't show up that way under the individual customer.  What the h*ll??  Thus far the only fix I've found is to create individual transactions and delete the batched one.  Ridiculous.    Do yourself a favor and avoid this product.    And a friendly note to \\""Mark\\"" from Intuit that keeps responding to these reviews: Save it.  I've no interest in reading the same form response that you've posted everywhere else.  Interacting with you may infuriate me to the point that I exert effort to find you and attempt to burn your house down with you still inside.  Go \\""do the needful\\"" somewhere else."
0,I switched to H&R Block after many years of using TurboTax. What a mistake. The software made multiple errors on my state tax return that I have to go back and fix manually. There is absolutely no customer support - the online chat feature is useless and there is no way to email customer support with questions. Next year I will go back to TurboTax despite the cost.
1,Same excellent quality as usual.  Still easy to use and very thorough.
0,Never ordered this. Hope I wasn't charged for it.
1,Easy to use and price is very affordable.
1,Thank you for being so clear about what's changed.  I don't like paying more but respect being transparent.  I will always be a TurboTax fan
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for over 6 years now, and it has been working out very well for me.<br />After downloading the program, I can add the information as I organize it and before I know it, I am done!<br />Every step is described thoroughly and there is help along the way if needed. Cannot think of a more efficient and easier way to do taxes."
1,"I've had no problems with it and have had no viruses (as far as I can tell).  I had too many headaches with McAfee and Symantec with them fouling up my OS.  And, of course, the price is a lot better!"
1,This software is a great alt to micro office!!! And FREE is always amazing! Compatible w everything I have needed thus far too!
1,Best tax software out there.
1,Good and Reliable software for repetitive use to manage budgets and account.  Has used for many years end on end.
0,"I upgraded to Quicken Premier 2013, mindful of others' reviews, but thinking that with R2, Intuit had solved the problem. I was wrong. Additionally, the Tech Support is a joke. Pasted in below is the message I just sent to Intuit, asking for my money back. I'm afraid that others will find this episode familiar.  (Addition to review as first posted:  others reviewing Quicken Deluxe 2013 have identified this problem, but mine may be the first to comment on it in Quicken Premier 2013.)<br /><br />Begin quote:<br /><br />As a long time Quicken/Intuit customer, I am angry and disgusted, after my recent experience with Quicken 2013 and your so-called Customer Support. I want my money back. I have removed the Quicken 2013 from my machine. Copy of my Amazon receipt attached.<br /><br />I bought Quicken 2013, which as you know is more expensive than its predecessor, for its iPhone and Cloud support. As I mentioned in my description of the problem, it doesn't work, refusing to sync my data file and giving me repeated messages (not numbered) saying only a cryptic \\""createCategory\\"". My iPhone, which had the Quicken App installed, would constantly say \\""You haven't added any accounts\\""--presumably because it had never synced in the first place. I got the \\""createCategory\\"" error message every time I tried to \\""Sync Now,\\"" and kept getting \\""last full sync. Never.\\""<br /><br />Though I would find it astounding if I were the only person who has had this problem, your web support is wholly silent on the issue. And when I called Tech Support (being told it would be up to 20 minutes wait, and actually have waited 38), I wound up with a guy in New Delhi India, who was totally ignorant with respect to the issue; said, \\""wait, hold on\\""; and then I wound up with another guy, this time in the Philippines. But he didn't know what my original message had said with respect to the problem; he told me he only advised on Quick Books, not regular Quicken; and that he'd have to send me to another tech support rep. I said \\""ok, if necessary, but be sure that I'm not disconnected.\\"" Sure enough, I was disconnected. 48 minutes on the phone with no support, and the prospects of going through that once again.<br /><br />This is not a properly tested and functional product. This is not customer support. And it most assuredly is not worth a price increase. It doesn't deliver on the one significant thing that's supposed to justify an upgrade at an increased price.<br /><br />I want my money back. Send it to my Amazon address of record, or the address below."

1,"I've been using Taxact (download for desktop) for years. Ever since I got fed up with TurboTax jacking up their prices year after year. I've had no serious complaints until this year. I was able to buy/download/install the Federal part of the program. And got that part mostly finished up. When they notified me that the state, plus the extra state that I ordered, were ready to be downloaded, I logged in and got them downloaded. But neither state will install. I've tried: re-downloading them; re-downloading to a different directory; downloading to the desktop;downloading directly into the program. I deleted them from my system and downloaded them afresh. NOTHING WORKS! I am getting very frustrated. I went to the Taxact site and can't find any help whatsoever. Yesterday I put in a trouble ticket, so we'll see if anyone ever answers that. What really burns me up is that I could have easily gathered all my stuff and taken it in to one of the many free file sites that are sanctioned and overseen by the IRS, and have them do the work and e-file it all for free. A few years ago I used to be one of the volunteers that do exactly that, so I know how it works. I just like to have the control of doing \\""what if\\"" scenarios my own self."
1,"A simple, easy interface, much less intrusive than Norton on a Windows XP machine.  I expect to have this antivirus for a long time."
1,"I absolutely loved the convenience of purchasing and downloading Turbo Tax Deluxe from Amazon.com.  I was able to make my purchase, download the product and start using it immediately. I would highly recommend both Turbo Tax and Amazon.com to anyone."
1,Definitely worth the investment to those who have not used financial management software before.  Pretty easy to use.  The mobile apps are a plus for this program.
0,"It's Quicken...what is there to say?  That's like reviewing a spiral notebook.  :)  After you get through converting your Quicken 2000 files about four times, yes, it imports into 2015 and works fine with no apparent glitches.  About the best I can give Intuit is, &#34;It works.&#34;  They certainly don't make the upgrade process easy, though.  It was just at the point where Quicken 2000 was no longer able to maintain its own files, so we had to upgrade."
1,"I have been using Avast since it first came out way back since I don't remember when...<br />It has always been reliable and has saved me from countless problems with malware.<br />I build and repair computers for friends frequently and one of the newer features that I really like is being able to make a scanner CD so I can scan an infected system even if I can't get to the internet on it. I find that a combination of Malwarebytes AntiMalware and Avast AV works well to regain control of a system that is hurting status. Although no one app can assure your system is completely free of malware, Avast does a good job of keeping it out in the first place.<br />If you do get malware on your system, the best plan is to backup all personal data, make sure you have drivers & install media with correct license keys. Then delete the old partition and reload your OS from scratch to assure the system is not compromised by something lurking in the background. Blessings & Joy..."
0,tried to download and install this program...not only do you have to know how to do taxes but now you have to be a computer programmer too...product was a waste of my time.
0,"I purchased this product over a month ago, and after spending over 10 hours trying to get it to work... I gave up!  My husband is an IT specialist, and not only couldn't get it to work, but we couldn't get our money back.  We spoke to the encore specialist by email, but we were never able to speak to someone directly.  Amazon says they will not give money back for software, but I must say... I will never purchase anything from either company again.  I attempted to have the disc sent to me... and believe me I spent many hours on the phone with the company.  I don't expect you to print this review... I just wanted to let Amazon know that I am very saddened that such a small ticket item could not have been replaced with the actual hard disc since the download did not work.  What a shame that know one was willing to help us at Encore.  Amazon has it's own rules, and I understand that... but if you are going to market products from another company and they don't stand behind their products... it doesn't give you or them a good name.  I have spent many dollars on Amazon in the past, and I'm sorry to say that I am very put off that I had to spend so much wasted time getting the product to work... and it still doesn't!!!!!!<br /><br />I would love to have a return call, refund or I would really like to have the hard copy disc......<br />Sorry I don't have nicer things to say... but it was a very poor purchase...and by the way ... the product itself was highly recommended.<br /><br />Vicki Marcus"
1,"I have used turbo tax forever and love it.  My situation changes from year to year and turbo tax takes care of it automatically. Stock sales, dual states, royalties, moving, charities, education expenses are handled seamlessly with turbotax deluxe.  I have never had a problem. It gets easier every year."
1,Worked great with new computer would recommend it to other user. And at the best price anywhere on the Internet.
1,great product
0,"I am use to PS 23 Deluxe.  I ended up ordering that one after I tried this one.  I didn't findd it as easy or as complete for what I use it for which is mainly greeting cards and photo work.  When the holidays are over I will take another look but for now, I prefer the older one"
1,i love turbo tax!! i have been using it for oner a decade now and wouldnt trust any other to get my taxes done right
0,"I have purchased Norton 360 and it worked fine.  However, when I had a support issue, I was in hold purgatory.  I hung up after waiting an hour and 23 minutes and still no help.  You would have to be stupid to purchase a product from Symantec.  It is time for a different product."
1,"Avast has an amazing free virus protection service and their paid service is even better. If you have the extra coin I highly recommend the paid version, it has so many extras!"
0,"After buying the software for download, you are diverted to Office.com which requires a login account. To set up an account you are required to provide personally identifying information (PII) such as birth date.  It is amazingly ignorant that Amazon is pushing its customers to provide PII to yet another vendor thereby increasing your chances of once again having your information stolen.  Not happy!"
0,"If you have used Quicken for Windows and are trying to convert to Mac, do not get this software.  I can't imagine why this software would not have similar functionality to the Windows version, but after 5 minutes I was shocked at how many functions were not included in the Mac version.  Not being a programmer, I can't imagine why the two platforms could not have the same functionality, but they don't.  Look for other finance software for the Mac until the reviews for newer versions start to be positive rather then completely negative."
0,"The product description is unclear and somewhat misleading. It says Federal + State but it actually only supports ONE state. If you have more than one state, you have to pay $40/state more. The primary reason I need a deluxe is filing two state taxes. The product definitely disappointed me."
1,This willmaker was easy to use.. I was guided through every step and its very easy to print off and access.
0,"I have used H&R Block software for many years (going back to when it was still called Taxcut). I have never really had any issues - my taxes are pretty easy, mortgage deduction and some job expenses is about as complicated as it gets.<br /><br />However, this years I've had all kinds of issues with this software related to filing. Most of these have been worked out by now, but one big problem remains. As of 2/7/13, I still cannot e-file my NY state taxes. In January it kept saying I needed to update the program, but when I tried to, it said it was up to date. Now at least it says they are \\""hard at work\\"" to make e-file possible, but all it does so far is tell me to check back every day for an update. I am sure this will work eventually, but it's holding up my state refund, and I'm not happy.<br /><br />The worst part about all this though is their customer service. As others have mentioned below, they asked me for my social security number and birthday to help me with my problem. What!? I just wanted to know why state e-filing isn't working. Why would you need all this information from me? After I declined to give it, the customer rep said she'd try to help me anyway, but in the end was unable to do so. Apparently the fact that you could not e-file at the end of January wasn't deemed important enough to share with their customer service dept. Oh well!"
1,"Never a problem using Avast,  many years now and protection has been 100 percent.  Easy to use,  update and no worries."
0,"I was renewing my subscription, I downloaded Norton and installed it and a few hours later i started having problems with it, It crashed my laptop so bad i couldn't do anything with it. I spent two days working on it trying to save it but every test I ran said my hard drive had bad sectors and not even Norton could tell me what was wrong nor fix it. I couldn't get it to boot-up all the way even in safe mode it would start to boot-up then stop and lock-up. I lost everything on my laptop I had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall system software and still lost a lot. I have another computer that i put Norton on about 6 months ago and now it's telling me my one year license has ended and I needed to renew it. I have 3 computers and I have to buy a new license for each one and that's crazy. i was looking in to getting Norton utility or 360 but i would be in the same boat.I will not put Norton on my computers ever again. I went with System mechanic Pro with whole house license and now have it on all of computers and it fixed what Norton couldn't. Norton was a waste of my money and time. Can I have a refund?????"
1,The download covered three personal computers and is protecting my computer very well. It is good Antivirus software for all computers.
1,Couldn't make it work. Save yourself a lot of frustration- if you are technically challenged like me-and call Amazon for help. Didnt get to say thanx-were cut off or whatever. Thank you guy at Amazon.Seems to be up and running now.My 5 star rating is for Amazon guy.Don't know how well product will work yet.
1,"Been using H&R Block for years, why switch, bought it here because for some reason, it didn't show up automatically"
1,"We have Avast! on all 3 of our computers, it is always up to date, never had a virus in 2+ years.  Great product."
1,"It's the great product with easy using, it's included our computer performance check. I had problem on begining since it's the first time that I use this software (this software was included in my notebook for temporary, the I extended it). I used the online costomer service, they help me until I found that this issue id my fault:)    So, finally it's the great product with the great service. Highly recommend."
1,"This was first year using the Mac version prior I had used the Windows version for years, no problems or complaints after years of use it makes tax filing easy for both Federal and State."
1,Love it.
0,"After latest update, started having video playback issues. Called support and got premium support. Said for them to troubleshoot the problem they would have to \\""remote access\\"" my computer and that would be an additional cost. Going back to TM security...they did not charge...."
1,I have been given free all kinds of other forms of security when buying a new laptop........... but never ever did any of them do as well as Nortons have always' done. Simple to use. and as well it works. That is the important part........... IT WORKS!
1,Use it on my computer a lot. I like them a lot.
0,I have not been able to use the program because it is not compatible with my laptop.
0,"Like every program I've tried in the last 20 years, this one does not live up to the hype. I bought this because I flip houses for a living so I like to make a fast drawing of my house and then place furniture around to see how it will look. Usually I knock out a few walls.and come up with a better layout. Yes it does that, but I cant even find how to change the height of a bay window. The furniture is so basic, I must be doing something wrong because it sounds like I am supposed to have access to all kinds of catalogs and thousands of pre installed furniture designs. I can't find where this is. (I'm not an idiot, I've looked at the help, search, and manual, and online video.) Yes you do get a pretty detailed manual unlike sone of the other programs I've tried. I can't find how to change kitchen base cabinets from regular doors to drawers. Yes these are all basic but they don't; give the option when you click on the cabinet where the options are. My view of the plan from outside looks like I'm floating on some mountain, who knows why. So iwith all this said, I still came up with a usable layout, and that part is pretty easy but the rest is all a lie as far as I'm concerned. (they will probably say if you read or clicked on some link all this would be solved, believe me I tried) the moral? Try to find a full trial version to see if it can work for you before you spend money on it. Although you still waste hours learning the program."
1,"really good.  I usually had a tax advisor do my taxes but over time they became simpler and this program was simple to use, when I needed support they were great.  The cost was definitely worth the savings of using a tax advisor in the past."
1,Powerful security at an affordable price.  I have plans to renew my subscription for this product through Amazon.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for top of the line internet security software.
1,"Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years, worked great again this year, Highly recommend it. Others have complained about how they changed what it covers this year and made some have to upgrade, but they did the right thing and included it anyway, I hope they continue to provide the same great service."
1,I have used many anti-viral programs over the years. This is the best. Updates frequently. Catches malware that others don't.
0,"Its a pain in the ass to use.  But it gets the job done.  Disappointed at the lack of detail given when explaining tax item.  The responsibility is on you to go find the tax publication online and read about the tax, taxable, or tax item.<br /><br />Ironic how a company called Intuit makes a product that is not very intuitive.<br /><br />I hate paying taxes."
1,I have no complaints. So far everything is good and I appreciate the fact that I have free protection.
1,I am learning new things with WordPerfect and I like the easy access to each product in the package. I would recommend it those who want to upgrade their system.
0,"It is better than most of the deal for Office, it lack outlook, but still was pretty sweet deal. You can share the price with others, and you can download it whenever you want, even after a year."
0,"The basic functionality is pretty much the same as the previous versions of Office, but saving files to something other than Skydrive in Windows 8 is unnecessarily clunky."
1,I dont review apps. only give appropriate stars
1,"Use it every year since 2008 with a complicated return. Fast and easy, and would recommend to everyone who does not need an accountant.."
1,Great for my transition to MAC.  Plus makes easier to work with old Microsoft suite files
0,"To get a normal competent tax program from TurboTax, you have to get the highest priced Home and Business version.  The other versions cannot do normal forms such as Schedule C for business or Schedule D for stocks.  I don't like being forced into an upsell.<br /><br />If Intuit's software developers are as dumb as their marketing execs, there are probably a lot of errors in the programs as well."
1,Turbo Tax is nice because you don't have to pay someone hundreds of dollars to come to the same conclusion as doing it yourself.
1,Very good virus protection and browser guard and it is free. 4 years and no issues.  What more can I say?
1,"QuickBooks online is easy to use, responsive, and secure. Integrating bookkeeping with payroll is a time saver. The support is very good."
1,It makes the process easy and fearless. Every piece of the process is mapped out and questions are specific enough to lead me through.
1,"What a bunch of lousy information among these reviews!<br />-- It's not $19.99 per month, it's $19.99 per YEAR.<br />-- No you don't lose the ability to open files you already created if you choose to not renew your subscription -- just as Photoshop CS5 files continued to open in Photoshop CS5 even if you didn't upgrade to Photoshop CS6, so too will all of your older files if you don't renew your subscription.<br />--No, your software will not stop working if you decide not to renew your subscription.  It will continue to work just as it had in the past, but if you don't renew, you don't get access to new features.  (Duh, just like not upgrading from CS5 to CS6. . . .)<br /><br />When you do a dollar-for-dollar comparison, the subscription model makes great financial sense.  In the past, you paid full price for a program, then you paid a smaller fee every 18 months or so for upgrades.  Now you pay less over the long term and get new features every few weeks rather than every year-and-a-half."
1,"Easy to use complete package of security and utilities covering just about everything you are likely to need, would recommend to a friend"
1,"This year I received a free CD from H&R Block for my taxes.  I tried it and ended up with the lowest refund ever.  So I downloaded this from Amazon, for less than I could buy it anywhere, and found another $1000 in refunds.  I'll never even try another product.  TurboTax is a proven software."
1,Works as advertised. I'm very satisfied!
1,"Had any old Quicken from an older computer.  I purchased this to go with my new computer, works great, does everything I need in a check book."
1,"This product comes with a lot of good features and the ability to find, block and remove viruses. I personally do not use the backup feature because I already have an effective backup process that serves me well and meets my particular needs. However if you do not already have a backup process then I would suggest this feature.<br />I have been using this product for years and am pleased with it. I was able to find it at a very attractive price (only available for one day) that I was able to purchase at a substantial savings.<br />I do not make recommendations for any utility product but only suggest good products that meet a specific need and this is one of those that I suggest to my friends and associates.<br />This product is highly rated by a number of trade publications."
1,Just love it!
0,"Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.<br /><br />Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview<br /><br />I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.<br /><br />In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.<br /><br />Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.<br /><br />The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance."
1,"This is a great bargain!  It was recommended by a computer technician.  I had only one problem with it when it kept catching a virus over and over constantly, and I could not find it.  I worked with a technician and we did several things - many things - and finally isolated it and got rid of it.  It did not infect my computer as the virus scan caught it and kept isolating it.<br /><br />I would recommend this virus protection."
0,"Avoid this software at all costs, unless you really love software that never works correctly. This has sucked hours of my life into a black hole of frustration. Customer service is responsive but never has a solution to any problem, since the problem is that the program is built terribly.<br />Specifically:<br />Sync feature has never worked correctly. When I contacted customer service they recommended I create a new account and wipe all my data.<br />Cannot disable the recipe feed that fills your screen with things worthy of Dump Dinners<br />Web import tool often crashes, and when it doesn't, is hard to use<br />Tried both Windows and Mac<br />Save the money, headache, and heartache, try something else."
0,"I've been using Adobe applications since the 90s. In the publishing industry, I started on Macs. I was impressed at how well Adobe worked with PCs so I bought one for personal and freelance use. I saved a lot of money to buy Adobe CS and have used it since I bought it in 2008. I loved it. I had no problems, even when I started using Windows 7. Though my version of Photoshop was not quite compatible, it still did the job. With CS, I used Photoshop, Acrobat, Illustrator and InDesign. Before I even read any reviews about CS Cloud, I worried about pricing, hacking and the like. I've put a lot of money into Adobe. Now they want more? I can't afford to continue using Adobe and I'm glad I wasn't on the Cloud when they were hacked. Their greed has jerked the best design programs out of my reach. I hope other software companies step up. I'd love to see Adobe squirm."
0,"I've been using Quicken Premiere 2015 for several months now and have gotten so fed up with all the glitches and bugs that I came on Amazon's page to see if there were any other complaints. I see that there are. My issue is recent 'updates' have played havoc with my passwords and especially categories. I have categorized my transactions for the past ten years! Over the past several weeks I'd notice that on different days random categories for transactions in my Checking account would simply be gone or 'transferred to unknown accounts.' When I go into my Category list I'd find gibberish categories full of symbols I can't even create with my keyboard! Categories like &#34;[] [] 89.&#34; I was concerned it was a virus, but a thorough virus scan showed no viruses. Then a few days later the categories would be OK. I got so frustrated I deleted the entire program and reinstalled without any updated to R7 or whatever it was. Then I noticed there was a brand new update version, so I downloaded that a few weeks ago. Now today, randomly, my categories are again missing! My backup is OK, but this is unacceptable for a financial software program that has existed for decades. Are you letting your new hires write this terrible software patches and updates? Your product keeps going DOWNHILL!!!"
1,"Does everything I need it to, but the product tiers and pricing are unnecessarily complex. Strangely, it is cheaper (by a few dollars) to get the digital download from Amazon than from H&R themselves ! I may be biased because my state's returns are very simple, so asking an additional $25-$35 for state + state e-Filing seems unjustifiable."
1,Love this program!  Works flawlessly and is very thorough and effective in repairing and updating your PCs. I use it on all 5 of my laptops and love it!
1,Works good for me
0,No much different than other chippers virus protection
0,"I have used this for 4 years and for some stupid reason fought with manually modifying the basis for these sales each year. This year I used my free support call for help with these entries and was given incorrect information. I opened a second support incident with HRB support, was charged for it, was given the proper information-including the fact that the software flat out does not handle the Form 3922 information AT ALL and there is no option other than to make the calculations manually and override the cost basis. They did refund the cost of the second support incident.<br />As this ESPP sale calculation is complicated and convoluted, I cannot fathom why they ignore it. After completing my taxes with the HRB Premium product, I was told that TurboTax does handle ESPP sales. I purchased TurboTax Premier, did my taxes again with TurboTax and am comfortable with the results-and the $700 or so lower final tax bill.<br />I have to wonder what else they skip...<br />I emailed HRB a while back asking for a refund but got no response, I will be pursuing this further when I have time."
1,It was ok in top five it work as stated but c s not so hot long wait time and out of country help
0,"I am using Quicken for many years.  The 2015 version is the worst among other versions.  There are so many bugs and I am afraid that the entire database will be destroyed.  For example, I tried to view my holding in an account, it shows only the name of securities I own and all other information (shares, market values, ...) is blank except for the total market value (which was correct).  You can't call customer service for help.  They now use online chat for help, which does not help at all.  There is no other way to communicate with Intuit.  They just abandoned royal customers.    Don't buy 2015.  Stick with 2014 or earlier.      addendum 1:  A new update fixed some bugs and introduced more bugs."
1,"Due to the type of account I have, I had to update so that I could do the web connect but I think it works as well as it always has and with the companion app has made my life a lot easier. I have bee using Quicken since it`s first release and have tried others and it still is the best that I have found"
1,I have never had a virus on a Norton protected machine.
1,I love this! Very easy to use. Lots of options.
0,"This software is completely useless.<br /><br />The manual entry system is so hard and time consuming to use, It would be easier to use a paper ledger. The software can't differentiate a bill payment from money spent shopping. I am so frustrated at this point I don't know what to do. I would have been better off tossing $30 out the window on the freeway.<br /><br />I'm mad that i'm stuck with this junk now. Never again."
0,"So, I rated the software as &#34;It's ok&#34; because it looks exactly the same as my 2014 version. I buy the upgrades hoping there would be a marked improvement in the user interface. It's still the same interface as 10 years ago. I mean seriously, I know the product is a cash cow for the company but you would think they would try to merge their mint.com product and user experience while differentiating the products even though they are complementary. Why is there a quicken cloud sync and it doesn't sync to mint.com?<br />It's one thing to keep the products separate so that consumers aren't confused but it's another thing to have no product strategy that adds value for the consumer. So, what, it will be expensive to overhaul the product? I'm not going to buy another version of quicken ever again until Intuit does something to provide more value and a better user experience."
0,"This is billed out as a great timesaver, especially for the small business owner who can dictate faster than most of us can type.  Well, turns out I can type much faster than Dragon can understand me.  It is slow, and cumbersome.  It slows down the rest of the programs on my computer to a crawl so long as I leave it open, it is constantly scanning to &#34;enhace&#34; its capabilities, but it is wasting time all the time.  All the settings have been reset several times to see if we can optimize or improve it's abilities, but to no avail.  I have already uninstalled it and re-installed it several times and nothing improves.  Don't waste your money."
0,"It would be great ... if it worked. Great features and -- once you get the jest of what to do -- it WOULD be good. But problem is ... I can't get it to work! It keeps crashing -- over and over and over. I'm constantly getting &#34;Not responding&#34; messages, so unless I've saved the Project just seconds before it crashes again, I have to re-do steps. I really wish it would work, but I've tried and tried to stick with it ... But I just can't anymore. SOOOO much wasted time in having to re-do and even start all over, the software is just that fouled up. And it doesn't help that the 'customer service' is a highly inconvenient 12hrs difference from U.S. Central time, being in Russia. So if I need help, I have to wait until, like, 10pm. All in all, it's been a big disappointment. I am on my 3rd video and I have no clue what I'll do, because I just can't get the darn software to make the edits I want. At this point, I'm looking for a new software."
0,"TO DOWNLOAD OFFICE365 YOU HAVE TO OPEN A MICROSOFT ACCT, I COULD NOT GET IT DONE AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS.  CALLED MICROSOFT & EMPLOYEE SET UP THE ACCOUNT.

AFTER SIX YES SIX HOURS OF DOWNLOADING, THEN THE INTERNET DISCONNECTED!  PRODUCT LOOKS OK, HAVE ONLY REVIEWED ITS CAPABILITIES."
1,I've used Avast ever since my computer tech installed it for me three years ago while he was getting rid of some viruses that had gotten around my previous big name antivirus program.  I have had very good results as they stay on top of what's out there trying to mess up our computers.  With the lack of problems due to constant updates and the fact that it's the same program that my service tech uses himself I feel well protected and recommend Avast Antivirus five star!
0,"Quicken is the only product that I can anticipate a worse product every time I'm forced to update.  2011 follows the pattern nicely.  After being forced to update from Quicken 2008 in order to continue receiving downloaded credit card transactions, I began the process of migrating my 15+ years of financial data into the new version.  For some reason, my credit card balance was about $2,400 off after the import.  I had to go back and make adjustment entries in several accounts to make sure they were current.  I also don't like that they changed the home screen - in Quicken 2008 I had several graphs in small rectangles on the main screen.  When I did the migration, it set all of the graphs to be the full width of the screen and one on top of another, so now I have to scroll down to see all of them.  I haven't seen any new features of Quicken 2011 that I'd actually find useful.  I wish Intuit would just let us pay a yearly fee of $15 or so and let us keep the ability to download transactions without these needless upgrades every 3 years."
1,"This product worked exactly as advertised. It was easy to use, yet powerful. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a convenient way to get their taxes done."
1,"I find this to be an extraordinarily useful program to keep my PC's in tip-top running shape. The combination of registry tweaks and other system optimizers, along with crapware, malware and antivirus capabilities make PC Matic indispensable to me. It is worth every penny."
0,"I'm still getting used to the new interface of the Online Essentials after working from a computer-based software version for years.  I'm liking it, but there are problems with the emailed Invoices now getting caught in my clients' spam filters which was not a problem previously."
1,"After comodo time machine was gone, I was looking to try something new with similar capability and thats when rollback RX. Its easy ti install and understand for a computer savvy like me. The snapshots when tested worked well and the way I expected. Its a great software to have and vital to fall-back when needed. Although its drawback is that if your hard drive is wiped or gone, then it is gone as well. But thats when you need an imaging software to fall back-on.<br /><br />Over-all 2 thums up to rollback guys."
1,I found this version easy to navigate and very intuitive. I certainly plan to continue with TTax as the results yoeld a confident filing and I am already set to start next year with the automatic transfer of data.
1,Consistently good product. No install issues. Completed taxes in a reasonable amount of time. Importing file from last year says a bunch of time. Probably the most painless means of getting through a task that no one wants to do. Recommended!
1,seems to be doing the job
1,"Download was easy and fast and everything works as it should. I used my school email, the email I received from Microsoft was is my junk mails so you definitely wanna check in your junk mail if you don't see it."
0,"I have used Quicken for over 10 years and have never had any installation problems. No matter how many times I tried, it failed every time it tried to convert the 2013 file to the 2014 format. I am now in a battle with Intuit to get a refund which takes up to 60 days if you purchase the download version!!! Buyers beware!! Do not purchase this 2014 version until they work out all the bugs. The fellow at Intuit told me it was because I had upgraded to Windows 8. Well...all I can say is that the 2013 version runs just fine with Windows 8 and 8.1."
0,I paid for this item promptly.  The listing said the software could be downloaded to 3 computers.  I downloaded it to one and that was all I got. Sent at least 3 messages to seller and got no response. I won't  buy from this seller again. http://www.amazon.com/Norton-360-5-0-1-User-3PCs/dp/B004IKEKWC/ref=pd_cp_sw_0
0,"I really wanted to like Office 2013. I was prepared to learn new tricks, have some of my usual ways of doing things in Office change a LITTLE. But I was not prepared to see some of my favorite features of Office DISAPPEAR. This is unacceptable, and the only way to send a message that it is never acceptable to take away features a user has been used to for years is NOT to buy the new product!<br /><br />In my case, I really liked the soothing blue color scheme of Word 2010. Word 2013 took away this color scheme in favor of various shades of grey. This is unacceptable—you give more options in newer versions, not take away old options, especially when it doesn't ‘cost’ Microsoft or the integrity of the product anything. The same is true for the ALL CAPS tab headings—it is harder to read all caps, and though I found a workaround by renaming them with a space before the text, I shouldn’t have to go through these hoops. The same is true for the absence of a built-in dictionary, which you now have to install separately. More examples: Previously I could have the split view of the current document into 2 windows using the right scroll bar, but now in Word 2013 I have to go to the menu for that. Why not just keep things as they were and just add a menu for that in addition?? To view recent files, in Word 2010 it takes 2 clicks of the mouse, and in Word 2013 3 clicks. How is this better??<br /><br />There are even more worrisome changes I found in Word 2013, some of which the Word programmers are probably not even aware of: I changed the Ctr+F key to open the classic Find dialog box (rather than the search pane on the left). I’ve noticed that when I open a large Word document and immediately after doing so I press Ctr+F, the dialog box comes up in Word 2010 right away. But in Word 2013, I have to wait a couple of seconds after opening a document for Ctr+F to even work. This interrupts my speedy workflow! Also, in Word 2013 the classic search dialog box manages tohide more of my search terms as I click Find Next, Find Next, to look for other instances of my searched terms. To discover such bugs, Microsoft needs to run Word on all monitor sizes in all Windows font scaling options in all zoom levels—otherwise they won’t find these bugs. With hundreds of millions of users, you have to do this sort of meticulous testing before releasing a new version.<br /><br />Here is another Word 2013 bug: When I have a table of one column and several rows and I have text in each row, say I select the text in the first row using the keyboard (Shift + Down Arrow) and then I continue to press the Shift + Down Arrow to select lower rows as well. In Word 2010, I can then DE-select the current selected row by clicking Shift and pressing the Up Arrow key, but in Word 2013 I’m stuck—I can’t DE-select text this way!<br /><br />Not to make this review too long, I will just mention 3 problems with Outlook 2013:<br /><br />In Outlook 2010, you can delete emails once you get a Desktop notification of an incoming email by clicking the small X on the popup notification. In Outlook 2013, you can no longer do that! This is a huge waste of time by forcing you to go to your Inbox for that, and who would want to give up this critical feature?? This is nuts!<br /><br />In versions prior to Outlook 2010, you could tell Outlook not to force you to include a subject (or at least not to bug you about not having a subject). I was hoping that in Outlook 2013 Microsoft would bring back this ability, but of course they didn’t. What do THEY care if I send lots of personal emails or emails to myself that don’t require a subject. Why should THEY force me to put a subject??<br /><br />Also, why can’t Microsoft allow me to specify that all emails in the preview pane be shown in 120% zoom?? Why does it have to be 100% unless I change it for each and every message each and every time?? Again, another obvious Outlook 2010 flaw that was not fixed in Outlook 2013.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to like and keep Office 2013 for some of its new features, but the problems I mentioned in this review upset me enough that I had to uninstall the trial version and go back to Office 2010.<br /><br />Office programmers should have more humility, more respect for their users, and better bug testing of new releases."
1,"I have been using Turbotax for a very long time (more than 15 years or so) and it has consistently delivered a close to flawless experience in filing taxes. The user interface is very intuitive and the guided walk-through makes things very simple. I have explored some of the more esoteric (at least for me) aspects of tax filing and have been impressed that it does cover these as smoothly as other routine items. Downloading of electronic statements from various provides, e.g., ADP for W-2, Vanguard, Fidelity, etc., for 1099's is very handy and saves quite a bit of time on entry/checking. I also like the fact that it sets options for questionnaire items very astutely and helpfully marks non-typical choices as such so that you can ignore inappropriate choices quickly. E-filing is also well implemented and works without hassles.<br /><br />There have been two instances in the past where I have gone to H&R Block or local tax preparers instead of using the Turbotax route. This was to see whether they offered any advantages to Turbotax. In my case, at least, I have found zero reason to use them instead of Turbotax. In all cases, including Turbotax, most of the time is spent on pulling all the relevant data together. So, doing it via Turbotax is not more taxing (pardon) the pun than tax preparers or H&R Block. I especially think using Turbotax is far better that H&R Block-type services - the latter don't really deal with exotic situations well and in many instances seem to add little value in providing an understanding of what your options are in tax-related issues.<br /><br />My only quibble may be in the way in which Turbotax allows you to modify entries made via the questionnaire. It requires a step-through of the entire item rather than showing a &#34;Finish&#34; option on intermediate pages. This is alleviated by the fact that, since it picks up entry fields from before, it simply involves stepping through, accepting the &#34;default: choices presented.<br /><br />I use the installed version of the product rather than the online one... still not comfortable with all my tax info being permanently resident at Intuit. It is a 50-80$ that is well spent!"
1,"I was skeptical to buy this... after trying four other very expensive brands of Movie Editing software I was at my wits end and was sick of shelling out 100 to 200 dollars for a software Suite... Sony saved me!  I won't go into a lot of detail... but I will say this much... when all of the other brands fail... this software really works!  The included help files, walkthroughs, FAQs etc are great for someone just learning but the software is sophisticated enough for the well versed also.  This software works flawlessly on my full sized gaming computer and on my laptop!  It is amazing.  Sony has really done a great job on this.  One amazing advantage is the ability to create a &#34;proxy&#34; file of the clip you are editing that allows you to see your changes in real time without bogging down your system.  The included extras with the package are too numerous to mention.  I highly recommend this Move Editing software if you want something that works and something you can actually get real results from right away."
1,"Quite an improvement over prior editions, which were quite acceptable."
1,"Norton has been and remains a standard I can count on.  It gives you the tools to monitor your network, keep your startup programs in check,  manage your registry, set auto offsite backups,  and while all this is available  Norton keeps your files and mail clean.  Norton 360 has a &#34;Tuneup&#34;  feature that does a machine checkup that nagates the need of other performance software. I have been using Norton for to many years to remember; the updating process has always been flawless and picks up all previous personal info so I don't have to reset anything.<br />Amazon download is fastest and cheapest way to purchase this software. Do not have any negative feelings about this product."
0,"Quicken 2014 is missing a very important report function (register report) that all previous versions I have used (since 1996)had. I only upgraded because Intuit had emboded a &#34;thing&#34; that would not let me continue to update my credit card data. If I had to chose between the register report function and my credit card data, I would have stuck with the old version."
1,Been using 360 for a number of years.  Stills puzzles me why I can always find it substantially cheaper on Amazon that by renewing directly with Norton.  Seems to me Norton would do well to offer more competitive renewal prices.  Have been quite satsified with Norton 360 over the years.
1,"Painter 2015 is the best by far. Why, beacuase it has all the features from previous corel painters including painter x3. It also improved on all the old and new brushes, making them feel like new. this new sleek version of painter is more compatible with Windows 7/8 along with old intuos tablets. I have an intuos 4 that I got for x-mas in 2009-2010. It works waaaay better than with painter 12.<br />I totally recommended painter 2015, if you want to get the most out of painter."
1,"I have utilized this product for approximately 10 years.  I find the system easy to access and provides information pertaining to recent tax law changes.  I would recommend this program to anyone preparing their own individual return.  Updates are provided on a regular basis and you are allowed to download individual states ( the initial state download is included in the purchase price).  E-File is easy and secure, and, to date, I have never had a problem with the transmission to the IRS."
1,Very good antivirus for most individual users. Automatic updates provide a hassle free way of keeping your computer and your eAvtar protected at all times.
1,Well designed and extremely easy to use.  I have been using TurboTax for many years I love it. I don't know what I would do without it.<br />Every year it gets better and better. It was well though out and has great attention to all of the details. The features are excellent.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.
1,"I love it, works great, keeps my computer safe, and I have never had a problem with it. Would recommend to anyone."
1,"This is currently (started using in 2014) the AV I use and recommend. I have seen no cons. Powerful, lightweight, user friendly. I just started taking care of a 5 station office and luckily Endpoint was in use. I can run the whole show from my office with the Webroot online console. For my non-business customers, I use other versions of Webroot and monitor them all from online.<br /><br />Highly recommeded!"
1,"Took my return to HR Block for a second look and they couldn't find a single cent. As long as you can navigate amazon and read this review, this software should be simple enough to use."
1,"The mobile version needs time keeping functionality and to be more robust. Otherwise, the product is excellent."
0,"I had the 2012 version and every couple of years Quicken 'forces' me to upgrade to the latest version.  I probably barely scratch the surface of what Quicken can really do...I pretty much just use it as a check register.  But I do use the ability to download the transactions from my credit cards and for one of my brokerage accounts.  So every couple of years I get an email like this:<br /><br />&#34;...the ability to use connected services like downloading your transactions and balances, online bill pay and live support. As of April 30, 2015, these connected services will expire and be discontinued.&#34;  (This is for my 2012 version.)<br /><br />I can still use the 2012 version...I just won't be able to download anything after April.  So I have to upgrade.  And Amazon is pretty cheap so I got it here.<br /><br />I really don't see too much of a difference between 2012 and 2015, to be honest.  What I do notice is it's a lot slower.  Slower to start up, slower to connect and download transactions from my credit cards.  And I seem to have issues with the 'always on top' calculator.  I used to use the calculator in Quicken and then want/need to use it somewhere else.  Say a spreadsheet.  So I bring up the spreadsheet and bring up the calculator.  And the calculator would 'stay on top' as I switched from it to the spreadsheet...fine and dandy.  Now when I do it, the calculator stays on top and the spreadsheet is underneath...as I want.  But as soon as I click the calculator to use it, the Quicken screen pops up and the spreadsheet is no longer visible.  Extremely annoying.  I guess the 'always on top' calculator is really always on top only in Quicken now."
1,I love the easy to use/follow program.  I love being in control of my own payroll instead of using a third party.
1,"I have been a Turbo tax user for 15 years. Since they are now trying to make you pay over $100 to get the software I need, I thought i would try H&R Block. This works great. It even transfers info from mt 2013 Turbo Tax software. Turbo Tax, you really screwed up this time. Thank you h&r Block."
0,"I would like a refund, I am not able to download this product afters four attempts. I updated windows 7, restarted my computer as advised 4 times as advised, the error message repeatedly said to uninstall. I did this like I mentioned earlier with 4 time consuming unsuccessful attempts. Finally I went to the TT web site and completed my taxes. I would like a refund on this softwear!"
0,It did update my files but I am not sure it was quite worth the money.  Maybe a higher upgrade would have been better.
0,I've used Quicken since 1997 and this is the worst version yet.  The account download feature is pretty much useless.  It won't download things that have cleared for days.  Totally useless.  They have obviously abandoned their very successful model.
1,"In addition to reviewing entertainment products for Amazon (CD, DVDS, Books), in my normal daily life I'm a CPA and tax preparer. I've been using H&R Block  software for at least 20 years. It used to be called TaxCut (and I actually liked that name better.). There are two basic Tax Software companies - H&R Block and Turbo Tax by Intuit). I find that H&RB is somewhat cheaper and more user friendly. There are three levels of the software. In H&RB's case, it is Standard (Federal only), Deluxe (with and without state - but if you live in a stare with a state income tax you should buy the with state combo - much cheaper than adding a state later) and Premium (which really is for more detailed help for self-employed people). If you know how to fill in a Schedule C then you can use the Deluxe too. There are just more \\""interview\\"" questions in Premium. I use the Deluxe.<br /><br />Though I'm reviewing H&RB here, I'll point out helpful info for those who have used TurboTax in the past. If you have any need for Sched D - capital gains or capital gains dividends - you will need to buy the TT fancier version this year. The Basic version doesn't allow you to do a schedule D. This is another reason to use H&RB.<br /><br />Now the reason I downgraded it from 5 stars is that you only get ONE State filing with either the Deluxe or Premium.  If you live in one state and work in another, you will need to buy (via download) an additional state module. This now costs $34.95 per state which is actually the same list price as the Federal& State package. And you can find the Fed & State on sale often. (Amazon had - as it did last year - a one day sale on January 2nd at 55% off. But there is no way to save on those additional states. Personally I think H&RB is getting greedy there. I think Turbo Tax does the same thing - but has a higher list price.<br /><br />If your return is simple then by all means use the software. But you might want to also check out local CPAs, who have tax training, and see what their rates are.  It may not cost that much more than the time and effort you spend using either H&RB or TT, and they will be able to offer you support too and offer suggestions.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br />Steve Ramm<br /><br />\\""Anything Phonographic\\""and see what their rates are.

0,"The concept of Adobe's switching to digital memberships appears to be a ripoff for the customer. Indeed it approaches property theft, enough so as to make one wonder whether it could be challenged in court, although presumably they must had had their own lawyers all over this in order to ensure that they can get away with it. The customer is being permitted to use the software for a price, downloaded onto the customer's computer, but only as long as the subscription is in effect. If you let the subscription lapse, you cannot use the software to open files that you yourself have created; you are prevented from having access to them unless you resubscribe. This means that Adobe essentially charges a ransom for the use of your own created documents; they, not you, are controlling your use of your own property. And at the same time, if you let the subscription lapse, 500 megabytes of software will be sitting on your computer taking up space even though you can't use it."
1,"As I can't bring myself to spend the money for a full version of Photoshop, elements is a good alternative."
0,"I have used Avast for the past 6 years paying for the renewal 3 times. However They decided to auto renew my account for $50 on a computer I no longer have. I called to cancel the renewal and the tech support 100% did not understand English. It literally took me 23 minutes to give my email account to the women on the phone. then another 15-20 minutes to have her inform me that she can not refund my money and that I had to go to a website to get it refunded. I took down the website and it did not work So I had to call in again to get this site read to me by a fluent English speaking person. They again were very difficult to understand, but it took me 15-20 minutes instead of the hour spent on the previous call."
1,"Absolutely love Word and Excel. use both products daily. Also, since most of my friends have MS Office, it is easy to share information."
1,"Excellent product. Scans do more than just stop suspect programs and apps, but also looks for wasted space and other things that slow the system down. 3 year veteran and zero viruses during that time."
1,Awesome tool for busy people. Photoshop was my favorite tool . But now I don't have time to spend so I needed something easy and loaded with enough effects for a home user. This is the right tool for me. I also have more expensive adobe Photoshop elements. But it lacks features. I regret in that buy
1,"There were a number of reviews that I read that talked about issues people had with the download or the program itself.  I had none of that.  I am running Windows 8 but that didn't cause any issues.  Download was very quick and within less than 5 minutes (I did the update), I was using the program.  I have been using the program now for a few hours (total time) and it seems to work without any issues.  Seems to be very much like previous years.  I have been using Turbotax now for many years and again I am happy I purchased this program."
0,"I attempted to move from Quicken Essentials to this version for two days. Syncing with the mobile app crashed and completely corrupted the data file. I started importing my data all over again only to have it crash again only this time I couldn't even load the program far enough to start importing again.<br /><br />This is a known issue which Intuit support was not able to solve, but I did find a solution posted by users who experienced the same problem. Show all hidden files and manually delete the hidden data file to start fresh. Next time you start the software it will create a whole new data file and you can go from there. Rather than importing my history I started by syncing with my financial institutions. It crashed and corrupted the data file.<br /><br />Quicken Essentials may be lacking a lot of features, but at least it functions. I am currently looking into other software options to drop Intuit entirely, but so far I have yet to find one that I like.<br /><br />By the way, Intuit has a money back guarantee, even if purchased as a download from Amazon.

0,"I purchased this version because I do my school work on two computers. The first download went fine, no issues at all and was fast and easy. The 2nd download was giving me issues. I read all of the reviews here on Amazon and tried everything suggested. I even tried going to Microsoft's website and downloading the trial and converting it with my CD code. Nothing was working. I was getting very frustrated, especially having read that others were having this issue as well. I was not getting any error number messages, it simply said, \\""There was a problem setting up Microsoft Office Home & Student 2010. Try running set up again. If the problem continues please contact Microsoft Product Support\\"". Today is a holiday, I figured they wouldn't be open so was trying to figure it out on my own until tomorrow.    One of my friends came over to try and figure out what it was. He didn't know what it was doing and why it wasn't working. He brought his lap top and told me to sign into Amazon with my account and try to access the file and see what was going to happen. After we clicked download it immediately started downloading on his computer. We had intended to just burn it to a disk and see if the disk would install on my computer. As it was downloading on his computer I noticed that he was using INTERNET EXPLORER. I had been trying on computer #2 with Mozilla Firefox.     I pulled up INTERNET EXPLORER and it immediately started to download! After a good 5 hours trying to download different service packs and who knows what else from the Microsoft website, FINALLY it started downloading! How annoying!    SO...if you are having issues with downloading, try to open a different browser and see if you have any luck. I can't believe it was something so simple!"
0,"I was having trouble with my version of quicken which was 2010, so I contacted support and they said the problems where do to my software being out of date. So I was instructed to purchase the latest one, which I did. Well come to find out, this did not work any better and there was no support with out having to pay for it.<br /><br />The software does not work correctly, and there is no phone support for it unless you want to pay for it.  I had to contact my bank for there help seeing there was non from quicken.  If there was another product out there, then I would go and get it instead.  I am still not sure if it will work all the time, so I have to back up all my stuff and hope it does not go out again and I have to start over.<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone. There has to be something better out there.<br /><br />Thanks, Gary Whitley"
1,"I have had Quicken for years and have not always been happy with it. Data has been lost in the past and not been retriebable. This time, I must say, the transfer from 2013 to 2014 was easy and accurate. I will not give it five stars yet;it's too early in the year, but if the program continues the way it has been going, Quicken may get its fifth star the next time you ask for my opinion."
1,Good
1,"...Soooooo much easier to use than Photoshop IMO...and I'm no slouch at editing software...plus you OWN it, you're not leasing it from Adobe..."
1,worked as expected
0,"The software is very glitchy on windows 8.1.  and I an unable to read the software.  My computer is an i7, 16GB RAM and 256 SSDR machine and should have no issues running this package.  I wish someone would help me correct the glitches or return the software to Amazon.  It isn't functional.  At first, I thought it was personalized settings of the machine.  I changed the scaling, resolution and even opened the program with a NIVIDIA gaming card in an attempt too improve the viewing.  I still can't read the text boxes and the menu bar is doubled up, and it is glitchy throughout.  Someone, please help make this right."
0,"I picked Quicken because I liked the product in the past. After installing, I wish my old version worked with Win 7 (without using virtual machine back to XP, rediculous!)<br /><br />Who in their right mind would create software that will not import ALL old versions of their own product??? WTH!"

1,Does as advertised.

1,"works perfectly, never a problem easy to install easy to maintain and easy to live with.  couldn't ask for anything more"
1,"Wow. I was shocked to see these negative reviews. I found BitDefender easy to use and non-invasive. The only time it &#34;pops up&#34; is when I am doing something that could get me in hot water -- like downloading a file that contains a virus. So I am not sure what the other reviewers here are upset about.<br /><br />What's more, Bitdefender rates very high in virus protection and online protection from independent test labs -- like AV-TEst and Dennis Technology Labs. Their browsing/ anti-phishing protection stops you from entering bad sites BEFORE you they infect you. Again, Bitdefender ranks very high, if not best in class, in this category.<br /><br />If anything, I would recommend moving up a level in coverage to the Internet Security or Total security. These include a two-way firewall that protects your home network against intrusion.<br /><br />Aa an FYI, I'm just a guy with a PC, No ax to grind. I a user, and have been very happy with Bitdefender since switching from Norton a few years ago. I researched it then, and the marks were great. And after reading the negative reviews I checked teh independent lab reports on Bitdefender again. And the results were the same."

I have not yet done so with AfterShot, it is fifth in line, but Corel bought Bibble and made it AfterShot, so it should be competitive."

Also, all my reports are messed up, and even with several, several hour calls to Intuit, they still aren't fixed.  I had to go back to Quicken 2011 to even be able to see my financial status."
1,"Made doing taxes easy, automatically gives you suggestions, provides explanations and is quick to use"
0,"I have been a long time user of turbotax - even before it was called turbotax, however next year I will go with a local tax service. intuit has priced themselves way out of range with their additional fees and charges. My son resides in New York but works much of the year in New Mexico. As advertised the Federal and State program and e-file are included in the price, however if you have to file in more than one state hold on to your wallet! Of course, you don't know that until you have nearly completed the return. It cost ANOTHER $75 to purchase the second state software and then efile the return. Waaaaay more than what I consider reasonable. Goodbye Turbotax, you've lost my business with your greed."
1,"May-30-2012. Very good buy compared with others retailers.If you know WHAT and HOW, download is very easy.<br />1. Make sure your GPS is compactible (plus minimum 2GB build in memory)<br />2. After the whole procedure of buying, Amazon will send you email.<br />3. Open email to get code.Get the code from library (read and follow email)<br />4. After you get the code write it in download window and click DOWNLOAD.<br />5. Depend on internet service time is very. Mine is 30 Mbps and took me only 1hr and 30min from start to finish.<br />6. Recomended if you looking for liftime updates.<br />  So, be patient,follow closely instruction and belive me, most disapoitments comes from not knowing what you do.<br />  Super easy and worth it."
0,"Bad move, Intuit.  For the last 10 or so years I've given several people TT for a Christmas gift every year, but no longer.  The product is too crippled and too expensive.  &#34;Deluxe&#34; is not much better than 1040-EZ at this point.<br /><br />But the larger point is this: TTs target market is people who:<br /><br />1. Are smart enough to do their own taxes<br />2. Are cheap enough to endure doing their own taxes.<br /><br />Did you really think these changes were going to go unnoticed?  Stupid."
0,Is there anyway quickly I can have access to the serial number for this product
0,"When you buy 365 you don't own it. You have to renew your subscription every year - same amount as your initial purchase. The big deal is the cloud - but wait - you can set up cloud on any computer and it is free! Where I specifically noticed items that did not work is large spreadsheets, and in Outlook not able to handle large files. Specific functions are no longer included. Why do people keep buying this is the mystery to me."

1,Decent tax preparation software. I'm a repeat user.
0,Had to upgrade and pay twice because all of our issues were not met with the basic version.  No warning of this ahead of time.
1,Works great! easy to understand.
1,"I like the new product.  However, there are always small glitches for users of the old products.  My saved reports do not display on the tool bar under groups.  I have to enter them on the tool bar individually.  Overall, though I like the new product."
1,"Finally a website creation program that is truly WYSIWYG. I've been using FrontPage for years and managed to create good looking websites but I've always wanted a point and click web creation piece of software and I've found it in this product. I'm redoing my business website (started last night) and I'm probably 4 days ahead of schedule compared to if I was using FrontPage. I always test my sites in multiple browsers and had issues with text and objects not displaying correctly when I used FP but with Serif WebPlus X4 this has not been an issue, THANK YOU PROGRAMMERS!     If you are worried about having to learn another program, don't!, as long as you are a regular software user you will adapt quickly. The only issue so far is getting my page navigation links to my liking. Not a big issue and I'm sure I'm over looking something as I've only used this program for 2 days.    I could go on and on about what I like but maybe I will do that later as I use it more.    Thanks again to the people at Serif!"

0,"I just called H&R customer support number asking how to use the software (purchased Premier + Business version) to report closing costs for new home purchased in 2014. After holding on the phone for 45min, instead of any guidance or support at all, I was given an 800 number to contact a H&R tax adviser but which turned out to be the IRS hotline number. I am completely shocked!<br />Needless to say, I'm returning the software for refund. (They claim 100% money back within 60 days fyi)."
0,"Highly complex user interface.  Difficult to do simple things. But with enough patience, a Mac user can make this tool work."
0,"I have been a TurboTax customer for over 20 years.  But after this year, no more.  In past years Deluxe was sufficient to handle my returns but 2 years ago I upgraded to Premier because of additional functionality relating to investment income. The upgrade was not required, just a convenience.  This year I am forced to upgrade from Premier to Home and Business.  The restructure of the product line is simply an attempt by Intuit to take advantage of it's loyal customers.  In one decision to gouge the customer base, Intuit has destroyed 20 plus years of goodwill and as the newsman said in the movie &#34;Network&#34;:  I'm fed up and I'm not going to take it any more.&#34;<br />I will be going to a competitor in following years.  Was it worth it Intuit? For me, not any longer.  Because of the price gouge, I am giving it a one star.  There are better values elsewhere."
0,No more Turbo Tax.  After using it for 10 years this is the end of the line. Never again. The 2014 H&R Block COMPLETE tax software is $29.99.  And it imports data from previous TT returns.  Thank you for your price increase Intuit.  Without that I would have just continued paying too much.
1,"It is a MUST read!<br />More people should read The Constitution of the United States, then perhaps they'll see how far down our Nation has gone from its humble yet glorious beginnings.  The writers of our Constitution had given us tools to ensure the country would continue on with the ideals written in the book, alas, we have failed in defending those ideals and find ourselves in the dilemma we are in now with the current Administration.  We as a country have lost so much of our rights.  What, I wonder, would it take for people to start defending the Constitution and their inalienable rights?"

0,"Horrible software.  ABSOLUTELY horrible!  Not sure why they even came out with this software.  I went against the reviews I read here about it and purchased it anyway due to a great price of $45.  I was instantly disappointed when it offered way less than mint.com that I use from Intuit.<br /><br />I ended up getting iBank for my Mac and iPad instead and put in a request for a refund at: [...]<br /><br />Maybe I'll look at Quicken for Mac again in about a year or two, but as of now it's not worth the time and hassle."

1,"Please note, I'm not a professional photography and come by the talent quite naturally. I'm still doing a lot of research on photo editing. My previous experience with a program was with Corel, which I found difficult to use, and could not complete every task I often envisioned with my photos. Photoshop has three different views you can move in and out of. Additionally adobe has free tutorials on their website on how best to use the various tools.  I love this program and it has certainly been easy for a novice, like myself to use.<br /><br />I love the different filters, the fact that I can move objects closer together and not have to do a lot of repairing on the photo itself. I quite honestly wonder what I did prior to using adobe Photoshop.<br /><br />Other than my camera, this is probably the next best purchase I have made in regards to photography.<br /><br />I've picked up several things, and I am still learning, but I would highly recommend this program to beginners."
0,Cushions too small but good looking.<br />Will use them and see how they wear.<br />Wanted 25 larger x and y dimensions.
1,What can I say.  Turbo Tax is great and it really works for someone that is not that familiar with our complex federal and state tax system.
0,"If you are Scottrade customer and want to import your tax documents into H&R, then do not buy this year's H&R since it doesnt support Scottrade. I have to manually enter my capital gains and dividends."
1,I've used TurboTax for several years.  I've never had a problem with it.  It works fine and makes it extremely easy to generate and file your tax return.  The basic federal-only version is all one needs in states without income tax requirements.  Don't buy the deluxe version unless you're sure you need it.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy the download only version but Amazon's approach makes it pretty much foolproof.  If something happens you can download it again from your Amazon account software library.
0,If you want to just convert unprotected files...I am sure this works fine...<br />.
1,"Thank you Quickbooks. I just started a business and this was the right tool for me. I tried the online Quickbooks for a trial, but I didn't need to spend almost $400 a year. At $130, this is a great price. It's easy to use and navigate. It keeps everything organized so my accountant does not have to figure out my paperwork. It updates my banking information and it was easy to enter in all my online accounts. It's a great way to create and send invoices. They have a lot of nice templates for invoices. The chart of accounts were easy to customize. I wish there was a way to delete a chart of account complete, especially if I made a mistake, but you can only hide them when they're created. Speaking of mistakes, makes sure you know exactly what you're doing at the setup. It's very difficult to change something without starting over. I never used the program before so I had some issues at first, but got through them just fine. For a small business, I will always recommend Quickbooks. Not only because it's easy but because most accounts use it as well. This will make it easier later on if you hire someone full-time or decide to open an online account."
1,"I have been using office 2013 since the preview and it has seen significant improvements in both functionality and stability. If I were to write this review when I first got the product I would be a frustrated user due to slowness but they have fixed that and now I cannot go back to 2010.<br /><br />Pros: - Awesome skydrive integration (perfect for multiple computers)<br />  - Very nice touch features for my tablet (My 3yr old touchsmart finally works properly in office)<br />  - very easy installation and key management.(Finally brought better key managment, I dont have to keep track of it, its under my microsoft account)<br /><br />  - My parents, whom are not tech savy, were able to follow the steps and install it without an issue.<br />  - A nice stream lined interface that seems to make more sense<br /><br />Cons: A DVD would be nice but only one of my computers actually has a DVD drive so its acutally more convenient to just use the web installer. This is nothing new microsoft has been moving many of there products to web installers EX: Visual Studio."
1,"If I had seen all these negative reviews before I started doing my taxes, I might have been worried needlessly.  I had absolutely no problems<br />with either my federal or state returns.  Some of the things I did that may have improved my situation were:<br /><br />1.  I have a Mac PC which may give better results than the Windows PC TurboTax version.<br /><br />2.  I downloaded updates whenever an update was available.  Thus I was always using the latest TurboTax version."
0,"This was the original review I left for the Windows install. I work across many platforms, and have been using Amazon Cloud for a while, so had to figure out what was going on. This is the original review, followed by an update:<br /><br />*****Original Post******<br />Works much better on a Mac than Windows because you can actually move stuff into directories that sync like Dropbox. But it's a complete fail on Windows. The desktop app is pointless. It allows you to drag and drop files, but you don't get to tell them where to go, nor do you have access to your files and folders on the cloud without proceeding to the web, where you then have to manually select and browse to where you want to move and download your files. There isn't even a way to use desktop syncing software because there is no &#34;amazon cloud&#34; drive to sync to on the Windows desktop. It's ridiculous and this is leaving Amazon almost completely out of the cloud competition. All the free space in the world doesn't make up for the pathetic interface. What's so frustrating is that it seems the infrastructure is there, it's just not giving you full access that causes the hang up. Same with their cloud music player. I love having access to all of my music, but the lack of features in the player and complicated functionality (how in the world do you remove something from the library?!) is just intolerable. I can't imagine that the photo library is going to improve much either. Amazon really needs to get their stuff together, because they are completely missing the boat on this one.<br /><br />*****UPDATE******<br /><br />Ok, so the reason I was getting the directories on my Mac was because that was an old install. So this is to confirm that the available app for Mac works the same as Windows.<br /><br />HOWEVER, after a loooooooot of digging and researching and trial and error, I think I'm starting to realize why the change was made. I gather that the idea is to be able to collect all your data fromvarious sources and allow you to access from anywhere (like every cloud does); BUT, it is actually preventing you from syncing all of your machines or devices with it because you could potentially be putting an incredible excess of data on every system. This is actually a valid reason for not wanting to use a lot of cloud services. It's also not a very good system, and sometimes not even possible, to move your data to a specific local cloud directory to get it to sync. So while I think Amazon caught onto this in time for the big &#34;unlimited data&#34; push, they haven't offered very good alternatives. So far, the only thing I've found to work is Allway Sync, which takes advantage of the Amazon Cloud Drive API that is now available to allow you to setup syncing. I'm trying it out now, and it seems to be working ok, but this only runs on Windows; I'm really needing something to work like this on Mac. I think it will soon be more accessible, but for now it's amazing how little information there is to try and access this cloud drive! The other issue, is well...what happens next. So you sync or backup all your data, and then you move to another machine where you need to access it. Again, that Amazon desktop app is almost useless. The only thing it's really good for is being able to toss stuff up to the drive, like in an emergency, in a completely unorganized fashion. You hope it all gets there because there's no cancelling or pausing, and you'll just have to remember to go online at some point and move it to where it actually belongs. If you want to retrieve any of your data, you basically have to go online, browse, select your files or folders, choose download, which then saves your files as an archive to your downloads folder, which you then have to extract and move to where it belongs. It's painful. Again, you could use Allway Sync (or hopefully something else that works as well) to simply do all this for you, but shame on Amazon for not making this process just a tiny bit more simple for its users. Would it really even be so much to ask to retain the dropbox type folder sync structure, and just have the option to flag how things get synced and unsynced? (yes, I want to always sync from here, no I do not want to ever download this directory to this machine). I wonder if Amazon just assumes that too many people will upload several terabytes of data which would then get unknowingly pushed around between too many devices, and wreak havoc on every server. Because the unlimited plans are so affordable, maybe that's why if you really want to use them, you have to do enough research to actually figure out HOW to properly use them! There just has to be a better way! I think Amazon was in a rush to try and beat out the cloud competition, without flushing out a good consumer-friendly plan. I personally do still have some faith that this could end up being a great solution for me, but it has to get better."
0,"Love the overall functionality of the product and have used Quicken for years, but have all sorts of problems with this version connecting to my bank one day and not the next to update transactions.  It also has issues working with Windows 8 and updating bank information.  I eventually gave up and installed it on a machine running Windows 7.  I am believing at this point I should have stuck with 2013.  There are constantly updates coming out, so hopefully one in the future will fix the issues I am having."
1,year after year I have been happy with turbo tax. This year was even better because it was so inexpensive with my PRIME discount... Make sure to take advantage of the extra 10% they will give you on an amazon g.c. at the end! woohoo I got an extra $100!
1,We've been using avast! for several years now: it is an excellent product that delivers! We highly recommend avast! to every internet user.
0,I was expecting better character recognition so that more would be read and filed without my time. What's the point of having it?
1,Just don't like the nags to upgrade. Works well.
0,"Google: \\""Classic Menu\\"" from \\""Addintools\\""<br /><br />They have one for Office 2007 and another for Office 2010. I use it and love it. No, I don't work for the company that made it."
0,"It's a very very difficult program to work with.  I'm an educated person with a master's degree in programming & still found it hard to follow.  It's not user friendly nor logical like a lot of software out there.  You have to be an architect or a software expert to really understand this.  I even watched over 30 tutorials on how to use this software & it was still difficult to use.  One step doesn't lead to another.  You have to do so many different manual steps.  Odd things will also happen like studs will be sticking out of the roof, ceiling joists are missing, roof planes won't line up, etc, etc.  I've never been so frustrated with any software.  Things happen to your plans without understanding why it's happening.  If you're not an architect, don't know CAD, aren't a designer, I would not get this program.  I wish I didn't waste my money on this program.  You would think for $500, it would be a user friendly logically \\""smart\\"" program.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. To the programmers out there who wrote this:  KISS-Keep it simple stupid!  There are so many softwares out there that are \\""smart\\"" with leading one thing to another.  There's no need to make this software so technical & so confusing to use.  Even Excel & Word has logic in their functionality with a flow of ease.  Someone at Chief Architect who's not technical needs to try to build a house themselves with this & see how difficult it is.  There are too many glitches & bugs.  You guys shouldn't sell products that aren't ready to be on the market."
1,"it works pretty well. Does what it's supposed too. download is easy, and free, along with just sticking with the main protection."
1,"I believe Avast is one of the best antivirus programs available - free or not.  I have tried McAfee, Norton (both paid subscriptions) and Panda Cloud (free) and I find Avast to be the superior product.  The only complaint I have is having to re-register every year.  This is really a nit because I do it three times a year - once for each computer.  I consider it a small price to pay for such a good product"
1,"I'm a long-time user of TurboTax.  This year I decided to try H&R Block At Home, because it was significantly cheaper.  That was a mistake, and I ended up coming back and downloading and filing with TurboTax instead.  TurboTax has always been reliable for me, and I'm able to file my taxes quickly and painlessly.  It's more expensive, but easily worth it.  Lesson learned!"
1,"BUT, we are on a pension so we had to find ways to save...  &#34;Medicines are getting expensive, so I went to a FREE software and have had no problem . . . Plus we saved $40 bucks!"
1,"As simple as you want even with deductions.  Like all else be prepared with the proper? documentation.  Also, the process runs quickly and smoothly with the ability to go back to any point."
1,"Great product, keeps multi PC's cleaned up and safe. Do not need any other software to keep your PC tuned."
0,If I could give no stars I would. This program didnt do anything but waste my time!!!
1,very easy to use
1,I use this ever year for three sets of tax returns. It makes the whole filing process pretty easy for me.
1,"There is nothing magical to say. It's QuickBooks. It does what you would expect QuickBooks to do. If you need a layman's accounting solution, it works."
0,I waisted my money. Product code not included. What a rip. This is a big problem. How many words should this take?
1,"Easy to use and straight forward for the most part, there were 1 or 2 sections that were a little confusing but overall pretty good tax software."
1,TurboTax lost me after many years of usage. Now that I have a fine workable tax program (HR Block) TT is trying to buy there way back in. 2 Late
1,"The Quicken Deluxe 2015 is a good financial program, but additional improvements still can be made.  One issue I had with it was creating a budget for 2015.  For some reason the current budget for January and the year to date budget would not balance for one of my line items (should be the same since January is the first month of the year).  I contacted Technical Support  about this problem and they could not explain why this was happening.  They had me validate the data but the problem still existed afterwards.  We sat up a future date to look at resolving the problem again, but the problem resolved by itself after a day or two.  I am not should if the validation worked, but needed additional time to fix the problem.  In any event, the problem has now been resolved.<br /><br />The only complain that I still have with the 2015 version of Quicken Deluxe is that it runs much slower than the 2012 version that I updated  from.  My computer is old with only 2 GB of memory, thus this may not be a problem if you have a newer computer that is faster and has more memory.  Nevertheless,  it would be nice if Intuit could speed up Quicken Deluxe for those of us who are using older computers."
1,as expected - fine
1,"no problems easy install, norton 360 never worked as well.  I do my own back ups."
1,"A friend of mine and his family have used Norton for years.  I finally got tired of 'playing around' with various antivirus programs and ordered Norton 360 from Amazon.  So far, it has done everything I expected: keeps my system tuned, prohibits me from going to some possible dangerous sites, and has a easy user interface.  I will continue to use Norton."
0,"passes all viruses in the computer, any protection, s***, I don't recommend"
0,"$120 AND you have to pay $50 for State - H&R Block Premium software is $80 and includes both - AND live support.<br />I've been a dedicated TurboTax and Quickbooks user for 10+ years.  Not anymore.  I'm done.<br /> The 2014 software has some 'rounding' issue and all of the numbers are off by $1.  Live support? None. The only support you get is searching on their website.  Why pay $170 for something that you have to search Google for help with?<br />And - they don't even have this product for Mac.  That's probably why the numbers are off in the software.<br />If you want to work, you'll use a Mac.<br />If you want to work on a computer, you'll use a PC."
1,"Best post-processing software available. Period. I is quite complex, so it has taken some time to learn. But, once you see what tweeks you can make to your photos, you'll be hooked."
1,"I needed software to track my small business finances and this is doing the job nicely. It's intuitive to set up and has everything I need to keep track of spending, income and everything else I need. I looked at alternatives but decided to go with what seems to be the standard. I'm not disappointed."
1,QuickBooks Online Plus is super convenient. I access it from a variety of platforms and devices and it works great in each.
0,Installed then could not register.<br />Could not tell if it works good or not as I could not register.<br />Would not recommend this product.
1,"I like the premier elements 12, but don't get a lot of it.  I am taking a class to learn more about it.  titles and blending sound<br />are hard for me to get."
0,"I tried using this for a while until I was so frustrated I had to find an alternative. Found GnuCASH. It's open source, actively developed, platform independent and works much, much better than this license leash garbage.<br /><br />Remember: this company's main objective is to keep you buying licenses every year. They only do a good job with this software if it affects their bottom line.<br /><br />GNUCash is developed by an active community and it's only objective is making a versatile, functional accounting tool. Developers fix problems and improve usability because if nobody likes it then they are simply wasting their time. Open source projects really do work. Think: VLC Player for video, Firefox for browsing, Audacity for audio recording.<br /><br />GNUcash is definitely the killer free (as in freedom and as in free beer) app for accounting."
1,Very convenient upgrade.
0,"So far so good, but it took quite a while to install on my Win 8.1 laptop."
0,As per usual quicken is awesome.... the only thing that sucks is that they have a great product that works but you keep having to pay every two years for the updates which you don't really see the difference.  I guess that's part of keeping us electronically safe and keeping up with our computers as they are upgraded too.  Wish I could just pay once and not have to renew.  Hey Quicken I feel like I'm just being gouged.  It would be nice after x many renewals you would allow us to become lifetime members and the upgrades are free.
0,"This is the worst app I have ever used.  It offers no functionality for people who are looking to organize their data.  You can either upload to a generic directory or download the entire directory.  What if I want access to just one file?  Any functionality beyond the two I listed redirects you to their website.  If you don't want users to have a thick client, don't write one!  You shouldn't offer one that doesn't have any features.  I would expect better from Amazon."
1,"I have been going back and forth about buying this product, somewhat discouraged by some of the past reviews. I shouldn't have. I had a very positive experience downloading and installing it. It literally took minutes and I experienced no problems whatsoever."
1,Excellent
0,DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE THIS!! THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY BUT DO NOT GIVE YOU THE SOFTWARE!!!!!!!!  I ATTEMPTED THREE TIMES TO VERIFY MY EMAIL ADDRESS IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD THE PRODUCT. I KEPT GETTING AN ERROR MESSAGE!
1,"When Intuit said they were starting from scratch with this product, and discarding the ancient Quicken for Mac (last release in late 2006), they weren't kidding. A lot of functionality is missing from that product, notably bill pay and manual transactions for investments. However, this is still a very capable financial management tool and does what it claims quite well. There are even some nice touches absent from Quicken Mac 2007 or even Quicken for Windows 2011, such as the simple budget tool that shows you quickly a 6 month trend when you hover over the amount spent.    There are obvious comparisons with iBank, but this product wins hands down. First of all it doesn't randomly crash, drop imports from your download because you spent the same amount of money twice in two days or draw charts that look like 4th grade math exams.    There are some serious shortcomings though - many financial institutions are missing, which are available in the Windows version and the free MINT.com (ADP retirement, Hewitt 401(k), Lending Club amongst others). Also the reporting is severely limited (although covers the basics) and most frustratingly, you cannot enter or even import investment transactions. However it's a good start, and hopefully Intuit will continue to invest in the Mac."
0,"starts slow, looses the data file when backing up to a thumb drive (occasionally). Can recover by reloading the hard drive file.  All in All there really is no reason to upgrade. I might add that Intuit bought Money Counts from Parsons years ago which was a much better product than this product when it comes to creating reports and keeping track of your investments.  Why they did not incorporate those features in Quicken is a puzzlement."
0,"I purchased this software in June, and to this day, Jan. 2013, I am yet to get a serial number for this product. The wild-goose-chase that I have been on between Amazon and Adobe, mainly Adobe, is no less than maddening. I have called customer service, read the forums, purchased a new computer, and nothing.  I am unsure how to proceed forward, as Amazon and/or Adobe still is retaining my money that I used to buy this product.  At this point, I just want a refund.  Trying to contact Amazon again now."
1,It performed as well as I had expected.
1,"Word does not have all the same functions as the windows version, but it is better than the native mac writing program."
1,This Norton 360 download will provide licensing for my three computers for a year at a great price! I am very pleased with the service!! Thanks!!!
1,"Everything I needed for going back to college.  Easy to install, and you can't beat the price for a 4-year license."
1,"Download and complete install, including the 12/13/14 update took a total of 12 minutes and went totally smooth.  I remembered to not close my browser until I received the confirmation email from Amazon with the license.  I copied the license to TextEdit in Mac, then closed my browser to complete the install.  When the step came to enter the license, all I had to do was copy/paste in the text field requesting it.  I found the use of the Amazon downloader was easy.  I bought this because sometimes I work from home and need to access Microsoft products for Word and Excel.  Works perfectly.  I can now use my laptop PC with Windows version 2010 compatibly with the Mac version 2011.  I wanted to do this right away while still possible to get my own software on the Office Suite instead of being forced to get on the yearly subscription plan.  Highly recommended for those who must work between Windows and Mac systems.  FYI:  I have Yosemite and had a fast Internet connection for the download."
1,"So far I've really enjoyed this program. There is only one thing that bugs my and that is placing new layers into the project you are working on. Instead of being able to place a file directly from your computer, you have to open it and then copy and paste. Other than that, the features are pretty user friendly once you get to know them and it is fun to use."
0,This version didn't work on my system.  So was a waste of money for me personally.
1,love it
0,"I am updating this review. Downgrading my previous 5* review, entitled \\""Saying Goodbye to Negative Feeling.\\"" This is not an easy review to write. Many years ago, I was a user of a different financial software program -- I can't even remember the name. Quicken bought them out, which was annoying, because Quicken was more expensive. Regardless, I switched to Quicken and had no problems with it. I used to buy the upgrade every few years, and was not even aware of having had to do so. After all, it was a great program, and it was always interesting to see the innovations. I even switched to Quicken Premier, when my finances were going extremely well. After the 2008 debacle, I realized did not need Quicken Premier, and switched to Quicken Deluxe in 2012. What a nightmare! Nothing worked - budget totals were incorrect, monthly budgeting was at least a month behind, checkbook balancing was impossible because the downloaded transactions were a month behind, investment amounts were wrong -- I could go on, but you get the picture. I was so angry after spending hours and hours on the phone with Quicken Support -- who were accessible and tried to help -- and having ongoing problems that I filed complaints with the BBB. In essence, I was offered a refund. I guess this was fair, but seemed somewhat cold after all the years I had been a faithful customer. Regardless, the problems did gradually get fixed as time went by. The 2012 Deluxe has been working well for some time, but the license has expired and, if I want to continue with direct downloads, I have to buy a new license, available from Amazon for $30 -- do not buy direct from Intuit! Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to give it a shot. After all, I have all the data files backed up and can get a refund if I really hate it. By the way -- there is some misinformation out there...you do not have to store your financial data online or \\""in the cloud\\"" or on intuit servers -- simply avoid anything which asks for a Quicken.com account/password, as that is their online process. Also, the settings options allow you to control where your data go. (You will still have to have an Intuit account and password, but this is not the same thing.) The download (about 10 mins) stalled, then finished, and the program did not function properly on the first attempt to update data. It stalled, and I had to close with Task Manager. I reinstalled without a glitch, and the program has been working without error. All the data seem fine. I am happy. But -- Read on! First of all, some positive thoughts...#1. I understand why people are angry at having to repurchase a license with an upgrade at least every three years. However, with Quicken Deluxe from Amazon, that costs $30, which is $10 a year, less than $1 per month. Other financial software is mnore expensive and, even if you go that way, you will still rebuy it every few years to get a better version, unless you manage to find a manufacturer who provides a lifetime of free upgrades -- this is not impossible; #2. I have looked at other programs -- I do not like their screen views. Some are so filled with data, you don't know where to begin, while others have so little that you constantly have to switch tabs to find related information; #3. You do NOT have to store your data in \\""the cloud\\"" -- a fancy term which really means \\""on someone's server;\\"" #4. Some reviewers are upset that the upgrades accomplish few new things -- this is at least partially true, but why buy the new upgrades yearly? Space it out. Also, although the 2015 Quicken Deluxe does not seem much different than the 2012, there are better graphs, and the information in general is better organized and more informative. Also, the program is much faster and automatically performs tasks that I used to have to do manually (such as updating the account information for a download to an institution. I think this is significantly different than the 2012 version, even though some of the screens may look the same.  Final comment: Although I am not interested in seeing my credit rating in the 2015 edition, Quicken planning tools were very helpful in improving my finances after the setbacks of 2008. In order of highest interest debt first, I paid off credit cards, then accelerated the payments on my auto and paid it off. I refinanced my home, which was easy because my credit rating had gone up to 825. I am now paying off my mortgage at an accelerated pace, and will be completely debt free in Sept 2018. It was very helpful to have Quicken's plan, with detailed payment guide, as a tool which made me very disciplined in doing this. It was and is very satisfying to see my red debt bars decreasing graphically every month. Finally, I am glad Quicken seems to have gotten its act together with this program. In closing -- I have used Intuit's TurboTax for a long time -- it has always been a great program! Once again, shop around!  Now, the bad news...after using the new edition for a couple of days, I received a notification that the R4 update was available. I installed, and most of the Debt Reduction Planner stuff -- which I praised above -- quite working properly! (Do I feel stupid!) -- the Debt Planner graph turned black; in trying to look at numbers only, any chenges (made through \\""Edit Plan\\"") gave incorrect amounts. When I clicked on the actual loan account and tried to manipulate the \\""What if...\\"" options in that window, I got lots of erroneous results in the Debt Payment Schedule. Aaaargh! (I did contact Intuit (chat line) and they did try to help, but nothing fixed the problems. Everything else seems to be ok -- they ought to get a new programmer in their Debt Reduction Planner group!"
1,Is not compatible with Google chrome and I was unable to download it. It was a better price than Turbo Tax. I did get a refund.
0,"Intuit, you greedy b*stards! You've removed Schedule C from the Deluxe version. I've heard your pathetic!!!!!!!!! excuses as to why you did this, but really, it's just a matter of pure greed. I've used your software for more than 12 years in a row but I think it's time to look at the alternatives. I hear the H&R block software might be pretty good and they haven't hamstrung it like you did."
1,Being using this product for six years now. Has never dissapointed me. Always get my full return. Also love the feature where we can ask the experts questions.
0,"I have been a quicken user for many years - so after being prompted to update to 2013 aboout 100 times i finally bought - i now undertand why so many people HATE INTUIT.  The cloud simply does not work - and customer support off shore is no support at all.  Where do they get these idoits?  I understand off shore labor is cheap - and also worthless - Inuit doesn't care.  All they want is our US $$.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT DOESN'T WORK.  Update. -  May 22, 2013  Sync now says complete. But Bank of America will not sync even though the process says complete. I guess intuit now throws complete instead of errors to get people to stop complaining. BUT it STILL doesn't work.  The. Disgrace continues. INTUIT how about refunding everyone that bought your broken product. I guess not.  Waiting for the class action suit!!"
1,A very reliable product
1,Loved it for what it did but I thought that state was included.  Now I need to purchase state at a whooping $40.  where I only paid 12 for this
0,print routine has to be clearer. must specify Adobe reader
0,Didn't download properly and didn't work as expected
1,This is by far the best accounting software I have ever encountered to manage corporate accounting. It seamlessly gathers all data necessary to exponentially growing my business! Thank you so much for this product!
0,The program  freezes all the time and I have to restarted all the time. Specifications were not clear on the print size. It was not worth the money.
1,USE FOR ALL OF MY PHOTOGRAPHY NEEDS AND I LOVE IT!I WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE WHO wants a good quality easy to use photoshop program.
1,A great program.  Simple to use and works perfect every time
1,"When trying to decide whether to buy this, I was very frustrated by the number of negative reviews which just discuss whether the upgrade is worth buying if you own the old version.  Customers who have owned Quicken for 10 years giving it 2 stars - does that mean it isn't worth buying for a new user? I couldn't tell.<br /><br />I haven't ever owned a copy of Quicken before.  I did have a MS Money years ago.  Recently I have been using Mint.com, which is also owned by Intuit and is free to manage things, but had been getting frustrated with how long it took to manage things because of the web interface. I did decide to purchase Quicken Premier 2012.  I chose Premier because we have stocks and IRAs, etc. as well as just checking and savings accounts.<br /><br />First, I was impressed with the ease of the download process.  This is the first software I've purchased from Amazon this way.  I made the purchase and was able to immediately download and install the software with no trouble whatsoever.  Excellent delivery.<br /><br />Overall I have been pretty happy with Quicken. It took a bit of work to get all my accounts set up to download, some accounts were trickier than others. (Ameriprise for example required me to call them and get something linked from somewhere, but that was their issue and they were great about helping me with it)<br /><br />Once I got all the accounts set up I was able to go through and look at my transactions, categorize them. I really like the reporting interface which lets me look at how I spent my money over varying time periods.  The budgeting software works very similarly to mint.com<br /><br />I was very disappointed with the retirement planning piece. I answered the questions and it said we would fall short, so I went back and changed things and the projection didn't change. I even said at one point we would save 50% of our salaries and it didn't change the projection at all.  So I'm not impressed with that piece, but we have a financial advisor for that, I bought Quicken for managing day to day money.<br /><br />That brings me to another thing, I figured since we had investment accounts I wanted Premier, but we work with a financial advisor to manage those accounts, I don't manage them directly, I probably could have done without Premier.  Perhaps I will use the investment side later on, I don't know.<br /><br />There are a number of things that really annoy me about the software - for one, if I edit a transaction and then click to the next, it asks me every time if I want to save the transaction in a pop up box.  There is no where to say 'Don't ask me again', so I end up hitting this dialog over and over.  Annoying.  This software should be much more polished by this point.<br /><br />As a new user, I'm relatively happy, I think this software will do what I want to do without too much hassle.to day money.

And I still haven't received my refund; however, they did tell me that the software was not compatible with my operating system Windows 7 (64-bit).  But still I did not get a refund."
1,"Fast download and installation via Amazon that worked flawlessly.<br />Sure there are all kinds of perhaps cheaper and even free solutions for playing Blurays on your PC (Bluray drive required of course).  I looked at a lot of options and read a lot of reviews.  The free solution(s) out there really don't appear to be just &#34;install and play&#34;.  Other solutions costing less to even more than PowerDVD had confusing options or choices and a wide range of reviews.  In the end, my time is worth more than trying to save a few dollars and messing around with something trying to get it to work.  This software simply installed and worked.  I'm actually kind of upset I spent so much time reading reviews and researching different programs - would have just been better off time wise to have bought this right off and got the job done.

1,Dear Sirs:<br />I have been using Avast Free Antivirus for more than three years.  It has save me from many virus.  It is not perfect but considering that there is a paid version of it that covers other issues I think is the best free antivirus in the web today.  I have used other free and paid version and I found this one is the best for my needs.
0,"I upgraded to 2013 from 2011 because I could not update my bank accounts.  I kept getting the CC-899 failure codes.  I was hoping that purchasing a more recent version would resolve this problem. but it didn't.  This all started in the beginning of December and has continued.  I have been on chat with tech support twice and sent my LOGs twice, but still cannot update my accounts with my bank.<br /><br />I like the program itself.  I am just really frustrated with this failure code!"
1,Worked great as usual. The best tax software there is.
1,"I'm one of many former TurboTax Deluxe users who chose not to be fleeced by Intuit dumbing down their software to force customers to spend $30 extra to get the same functionality as last year.  The H&R Block Deluxe software downloaded and installed correctly on my Windows 7 PC in just a matter of minutes.  It then correctly transferred my data from my 2013 TurboTax file.<br /><br />It seems the majority of the 1 star reviews for this product are from people still using Windows XP.  Might be time to upgrade, folks.  Even Microsoft no longer supports XP, and it's their product!"
1,"Its a good anti-virus software. I've been down the road with Norton, MacAfee. It doesn't lag down my computer like Norton did.<br />Its easy to customize your settings. What to block, when to scan, the logs, etc.<br />The only complaint is. If you purchase the basic system. The additional &#34;upgrades&#34; are pop ups. Software updater. etc.<br />Other then that. It works great."
1,They had me at &#34;Free&#34;
1,pretty fast download and everything works great! Some people had trouble getting the access code but everything worked fine for me.
0,"I am not at ll pleased with the latest version of iBank (Version 5.2.1 - 50050). It repeatedly drops the Direct OFX connections to my bank and credit cards. This is bad enough but iBank provides a false indication that the connection is still working. Only when I check my account in a browser can I verify the connection status. I've worked with tech support but none of the various solutions offered has worked.    Also, importing checks is a pain in the ass because iBank arbitrarily assigns an erroneous payee and category, which requires me to dig through my paper check stubs to sort out the transactions. Instead of saving me time, the software is creating more work.    I switched from Quicken about four years ago and have up until now been fairly satisfied with iBank but this is really too much to handle.    I may return to iBank when these bugs are fixed but until then, I am switching back to Quicken.    UPDATE 12/10/2014:  Today, when opening my iBank 5 file I was dismayed to find that the application had gone completely berserk. I cannot locate any back-up (and I'm no novice to Mac) and I cannot export the data to QIF to rebuild the file. Versions 3 & 4 of iBank were okay but v. 5 is an absolute NIGHTMARE!"
1,The product has been extremely useful to my wife and I.Simple download and availability of support is superb!.
1,"I only want to use Quicken as a check register.  I have used Quicken on Windows (when it installed off a diskette in the early years) up through my switching to Mac (for the last 10+ years.)  I was happy with the installation, with the linking to their Credit Union checking accounts, and with the ease I had transitioning from the old software I was comfortable with to the new version.  That said, I have not used it enough to rate it much past a check register software.  So far, so good."
1,Nice and works well.
1,only had pc matic a few months. so far very pleased with it.
1,ok for now but quicken needs to add the features found with the windows program (retirement planner)
0,Didn't like the interface.
1,I used Turbo Tax forever. Tried H&R this year. Pretty straight forward. Couple of areas didn't explain real well. I'd use it again.
1,"So far so good. Limited functions, just your basic editor. I got it because my computer broke and I had to use an older system till I get a new one. With an older system nothing I had would run on it. This will run fairly stable on my old computer and get the basic job done. It is missing a lot of features I am used to with Premiere, but for $20 to get some basic editing done you can't go wrong. I am purchasing the full product and will keep using it into the future as a basic editor for things on my laptop or when I am on a system that can't run programs like premiere. For $20 you can't beat it. If you are a novice editor or just trying to do some stuff for personal use then this is the tool for you."
0,Does not output MP3. Puts out a MPC. Does not put out a WAV. Puts out a WV. These files are not compatible. The description is totally inaccurate and may be deceptive. Recordings seem to be only good with this software.
1,It is easy to use. I have not had any problems with it..  Why go anywhere else? It is a good price-free.
1,"Good protection, I love it!"
1,One of the best antivirus programs around free or otherwise. Regular updates keep up with the changing virus/malware schemes. A definite A+++ for all. Highly recommended.<br /><br />D Upton
0,I have tried for 2 days to update the program.  I have contacted support without success. I have stopped my anti virus program and my firewall to let the update through.  I have done everything their support says to do. No success!!! i WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER PROGRAM TO DO MY TAXES. A waste of time and money.
0,"After fighting the horrible 2013 Quicken for a year, I thought I would try the upgrade. It took me literally months to work through the 2013 version, but had it working adequately and doing at least the minimum to meet my needs. This was after endless aborts, failures, reboots, restarts, unlinking cloud files, backups and validate files. I upgraded to 2014 Quicken for Home & Business and it does not even provide working functionality I was able to achieve with significant effort from 2013 after $80 more and too many hours of my time. Intuit should be paying me for troubleshooting. Shame on me. I thought I would try the upgrade?, work with it for a while (2 weeks) and see what the new release would do. This was again after endless aborts, failures, reboots, restarts, unlinking cloud files, backups and validate files. I wanted to try it one more time since I have been a Quicken user for over 20 years, upgraded every year and have a large file and history.<br />I just don't have the time or patience to chat through hours of debugging and will explore the 60-days money back guarantee and return to 2013 which I have seen in these reviews is another endless hassle. Intuit brought out Mint.com, a free service with similar functionality to Quicken that actually works-maybe some code sharing? I thought the nightmare that was 2013 would be a wake-up call for Intuit get some QA and testing methods in place. I guess not because we keep paying and hoping.<br /><br />Specifically, running release R3 (23.1.3.15) the dreaded loss of functionality (DLOF) and issues:<br /><br />* Consistently aborts on cloud sync with budget included with various error codes - 71XX, 72XX - seems to sync faster, but who cares if it aborts every time.<br />* Planning functions - does not show all my budget groups in display as it did in 2013-only 4 of the groups display.<br />* My main checking account will not sync with the cloud, which make the mobile versions pretty useless-no error message just can't set it up with the cloud.<br />* Planning tab - does not remembered the display state of expanded or collapsed-always comes up fully expanded for the 4 groups that do display.<br />* Still has the problem with splits in transaction being scrambled and duplicated after cloud sync<br />* Seems faster not so clunky, but still bloated and takes over machine for certain functions.<br />* Often just aborts with no message, just gone<br />* Standard keyboard shortcuts not working (eg, Ctrl V)<br />* One-step update seems better although still some account that are supposedly support, just plain don't update and no clue as to why.<br />* One-step updates- when you select update your settings, only cancel or schedule updates are presented as an option.<br /><br />Zero stars was not an options, so I gave it 1. Quicken needs a totally rewrite because trying to fix this mess is just not working.<br /><br />PS: After the R3 update, sync of accounts hangs evey time, so exactly the same symtoms presented by 2013 last year. So, now the routine-run sync, it hangs, but sorta half updates account-not the cloud, restart Quicken, run the validate file-repeat until frustrated. Now becoming unusable. Intuit-this is what happens when the new version become date driven. Every piece of software has bugs, but this is way beyond anything  I have seen, especially after 3 revs."
1,"I've been using Avast for six years and have never had a virus issue of any kind.  I can't say the same for Norton, which I used (and paid for) prior to that."

1,Microsoft Office down Load fast and easy to go no need for Disk license is stored in your Microsoft account if needed to reinstall.
1,Excellent antivirus program!  I recommend it to all my friends and family.
1,"I am a sole proprietor with a very small business so I wasn't very demanding of TurboTax. It did everything I needed it to do and installed, updated and worked easily. As with ALL tax software, there are going to be times when you just have to know what you are doing and have some knowledge of taxes or you won't be able to answer the questions, but this is not the fault of the software.<br /><br />I was quite annoyed how difficult it was to find what was included with the State software. I read many reviews and went directly to the TT website. Along with 5 Federal E-Files, at least one State E-File was included. The website seems to say free in one place and $39.99 in another. It may be due to the differences in the on-line vrs downloaded vrs disk versions, but it should NOT be so hard to figure out and I'm obviously NOT the only one.<br /><br />The other problem is with their free support. The first time I tried the online chat, I waited an hour which is understandable, but the chat froze during my turn and I lost contact and had to start all over. When I finally did explain my question and receive an answer, I felt (and still feel) the answer to be incorrect. I can find no way to have the issue looked into so I may have found a bug in TT that can affect many people but it doesn't seem anyone at Intuit cares.<br /><br />I have not used other tax software but TT seems to do what it should in an easy to use manner."
1,The resume maker provided me the tools to have a professional resume. There are many types of resumes to build from.
1,"What can I say– it's TurboTax. I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars for the screwup of not putting the itemizing forms in the deluxe version this year. Hope they get it right next year. My biggest problem with getting my taxes done was, as always, keeping my records through the year. This software made it quite clear what I had failed to do, and once I had everything in hand the job was done as easy as pie."
1,"USEFUL,PRAGMATIC AND NECESSARY"
0,this program does not work.  It will not let me register it to get it out of display mode.
0,There is nothing stating that you can not make a joint will before you buy this product. Only after you pay for a download can you see that Quicken Will does not allow joint wills. I just spent $20 for nothing. I will be demanding a refund.
1,"haven't dug too deeply into this new version yet...but already, the online banking has been better---no error messages yet (like in the last version---always asked for passwords again)<br />also, like the new layout \\""look\\"" of the program so far.  time-will-tell."
1,Exactly what I ordered - finally figured out the download after a few hours..
1,I bought Norton 360 a year ago with a new computer.   I was somewhat reluctant to try Norton 360 as I had Norton in the past and it really slowed my computer down and missed a lot of viruses.   I had been using some of the free anti virus programs with better success.  Norton 360 seemed to be a real improvement over the Norton that I had used in earlier years.  It came time for renewal and Norton wanted $70 for renewal and I was thinking of going back to the free anti virus.   I checked Amazon and found out I could get a fresh download for 3 computers for about one half the price of Norton's renewal.  I only had to enter the new product key ( wait until the last day as the time left is not added).   I have also installed Norton 360 on my second computer and I still have one computer to go.     Norton 360 has not only caught viruses but the adware that tries to take over your system.   I also like the Norton 360 backup system.  I have been able to back up using a memory stick.   So far after one year I can not find a problem with Norton 360.
1,This is a great program and has saved me many times from possible catastrophic situations.  SafeZone Browsing is great too with no  frills.
1,This works seamlessly on my 2009 Imac.
1,Easy to use. no issues with the program. Wish you could more easily by-pass the state return. Always submit it separately.
1,Was remarkably easy to use and get up to speed on versus the older quickbooks program I had on my computer.  Cloud base is also a big plus.
1,"What more needs to be said, it's Turbo Tax at it's finest. Easy to follow instructions, step-by-step guides. Saved me hundreds of dollars that would have gone to an accountant that asked the same questions this software does. Excellent choice."
1,"It has been many years since I last did a web (using Microsoft's Front Page 1.0). Then I was a medical center CIO, trying to meet the needds of Doctors, Nurses etc. It was difficult - not compared to writing raw HTML- but plenty difficult enough, thank you very much.<br /><br />Now I am long retired, and decided to create a web for my son's new business. I researched available tools at length, finally chose this one, downloaded it, and set about learning it. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I spent one day learning, and four days building the entire site, complete with all content.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the power and speed that represents, a friend of my son had been working on the site for five months using Word Press, and was still a LONG way from a finished product. I was able to find a template in XARA that was fairly close to the look he had designed, and modified the template quickly to be a very close match. Now my 23 pages and the 3 or 4 pages he had built interact seamlessly.<br /><br />The product comes with a help system that includes videos and access to a more in depth website called the XARA Xone that provides answers to the trickier questions. Somethings take a little trial and error to understand, but I unreservedly recommend this product."
1,great price.
1,Avast met all of my expectations. I feel very protected.
0,", Not as easy to use as Microsoft Money"
0,"I upgraded from Quicken 2009. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am.  It's not at all User friendly,  trying to use the manual entry is a complete joke.  Shame on Intuit, you should have talked with long time users.  I would no buy it again or recommend this product to anyone."
1,Avast does more than I expected it to do.. I have not had a virus on my computer since installing Avast. I think that this is great because i go places where there is high exposure.
1,Necessary to make the MACAIR that I have do exactly what I need!
0,"Poor quality product.  Does not allow for much customization and the output photos are very poor, also. It is difficult to give it a massive, organized library of photos to draw from, also"
1,I bought it to keep track of my checking account and it downloaded all my transactions kinda surprised me.  Not sure I liked that til I had the chance to tell it to or I missed something.  I have always used Quicken but 2006 was my last one.
0,"I have been using Quicken for several years and upgrade about every 2-3 years. I love the product and have never had any issues with it until I purchased 2014. It looked exactly like the 2011 version I was using. I couldn't find any difference at all except I could use a mobile device with it. So for the money it wasn't worth the difference. But, the reason I returned it was it kept shutting down on me. I did some research and there were a lot of others who were having the same issue. I need something I can depend upon, not something that will shut down in the middle of a transaction. I saw nothing on the Quicken website about the defect or any news of a fix.<br />Oh and one thing more. I had to manually go in and put all the transactions in I had done on 2014 when I went back to 2011. The file was not compatible with the old version. Yuck!"
1,I have used Norton products for years and it has always worked. This 2015 version works and found a virus right away. Easy to install and use.
1,"Purchased and downloaded this a couple of weeks ago.  I waited to review it a few weeks to give myself an opportunity to use the program.  Unlike the other review, the download to my Macbook pro was flawless and took no more than a few minutes.  The installation was easy and I was up and running in less than 10 minutes total.  The other reviewer apparently had a lot of issues.  Perhaps it was a computer or internet connection issue.  I cannot speak to the customer service issue but I do know that Amazon has ALWAYS taken care of any problems I have had with purchases.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this should not hesitate as long as you have an updated operating system and a reasonably fast internet connection."
0,After I down loaded it it said it was the wrong one then I had to down load another one.  I'm not sure but I think I was charge twice
0,This is the cheapest software for antivirus ever... It keeps on saying my antivirus is not ative every few days or so and it really sucky and it really dont work perios so dont buy it
1,"The error message displayed to me when installing on Windows 7 was \\""The application has failed to start due to a side-by-side configuration error.\\""  Some web searching shows this error type is not uncommon.  One fix-it approach involves some registry editing to update library numbering; I tried that, and it didn't work for me.  Other fix-it approaches involve uninstalling and reinstalling supporting C++ software.  Fortunately, I had another computer to try, and it installed fine on Windows 8.  Other than the installation issue, the program works fine and is easy to use."
1,It is a great program!!!  It had fround 3 virus that Norton's had not pick up on.  &#34;IT IS A MUST HAVE SOFTWARE&#34;!!!!!!
1,"Thus far, this product is working as expected with no issues whatsoever. It's nice that Amazon was the direct seller so I feel safe about its authenticity."
0,"It really doesn't have the &#34;ease&#34; to use it like the prior quicken programs.  I can't really understand how to use it or why this was released without consumer testing! I am still trying all common sense approaches to use this program!  Furthermore,  I'm now apprehensive to use Turbotax ( as I have for the last 10 years) as it is made by the same manufacture, Intuit!"
1,"I like it very much, it is very easy to use. Updating from previous version should be a little cheaper. Also when bundled with Turbotax Deluxe"
0,"Took two hours to get by password etc.  Then it did not do what I expected.  Buying on amazon and downloading it, I am stuck with it.  It has been uninstaled and I know I will not download again."
1,Needed this update to have the new features that the new product provides. It makes it easier to keep my financial records up to date.
1,"Continues to be a good products, however, there are some issues with mysterious duplicate accounts after an upgrade.  Customer support (live chat) was not exactly helpful."
1,ok
1,Nice Finance program.
1,"I've been using TurboTax since I've owned a computer. I like the fact that the info from the previous year is merged on to the next year. You put the info in once. With the info in there, you know what paperwork will be required to do your taxes. Very nice feature. Very simple program to use."
0,"Phew - what a stinker.  Intuit's bait-and-switch on 2014 Turbo Tax is so self defeating, it boggles the mind.  A corporate decision right up there with &#34;We'll make the computer hardware - but not the software.&#34;  They've alienated their customer base is so extensively, it should be taught in MBA Program lectures on 'What were they thinking when they killed their company?'"
0,"I have used this product for many years with good results. However, I never had a serious tax question in all those years. This year, I did. I learned that questions are just posted for comment by other users. Their much-touted experts are nowhere to be found. They give you a phone number - it's for the IRS."
0,"This product gets worse not better with every new version, less control, less critical information and support gets worse every year and more unintelligible....put this one in your never again list... I know I will...A special award should go to their support staff who know less about their product than any support staff I've seen, even the slightest inquiry requires a 10 minute search followed by an inane general comment than doesn't fit the question all in an undeniably Asian accent (if you're gonna hire lousy, at least make them taxpayers)."
1,"Works better than ever. The version SNAFU this year was unfortunate, but apparently Intuit is offering $25 cash back to those of us forced to upgrade to a version we didn't need. Hopefully, they will get back to their previous product version capabilities going forward."
0,"Short story - same old thing, not worth the money! I can't believe someone hasn't created a free check register/payment reminder that will sync with iphone app and import quicken files! I Hate the new reconcile column! Wish I could go back to 2010 but they trap you once you upgrade and start entering stuff.      Long Story - When I bought my first home PC in 98 it had a neat little program among the HP bloatware that allowed me to toss my check book register and helped me know what I really had in my account vs. what the bank said (I used to have to call them as they weren't online). Times were tight then. Fast forward to 2011. Times aren't as tight (having to eat ramen noodles all week vs. ordering chicken at the japanese steakhouse in lieu of lobster and filet), but I still need a way to know what's in my account (or better what will be in my account in two weeks).     The sad thing is quicken is still the same as it was in 98 (except for using 3.5 floppys for backup). Not much has changed. Much like windows they use the same code, every year. They change the color schemes but no revolutionary things have come about. I know the online thing has been played up, but until they bring quicken totally online (didn't they do that?)and have an iphone app that will allow me to enter my charges as they happen, I'm stuck with good old quicken.    So when my computer crashed and I had to reload windows 7, I went to install a version of quicken 2010. Let's just say that I was into newsgroups at the time and the version wasn't completely legitimate. So I wanting to do the right thing decided to buy quicken. 2011 was cheaper than 2010 so I figured why not download that one. Well I was wrong. I should have stayed with 2010.    2011 is again the same exact thing for a basic user like myself who only uses it as a check register, to remind me to pay my bills and to keep track of spending (on a side note I love knowing that I've spent over $60,000 at walmart.    One thing I hate isthat I used the reconcile column to tell me if the item was going through or paid by using a C, and if it cleared the bank totally R). I know that wasn't right but it worked well. If the item was in quicken without an R or C, it meant that I needed to pay it or it would go through automatically in a while. In 2011 I can't tab to the reconcile column I have to click and I can't type in that field, I have to use my mouse to choose the C or the R and if I click wrong it brings me into this reconcile feature which I hate!!! because my bank never calls charges what they are.    So if you have quicken, never upgrade. Who cares about \\""updates\\""..what are they updating anyway?"
1,I've used this software for years & Tax Cut. Was always a good investment with accuracy & ease of calculations. The one day special was too good not to download. Would do it again next year.
1,"Been using for years.. very stable, and helpful/"
1,Easily downloaded and installed.
1,This is a great product. I am glad I switched to it and I put it on all my friends computers that I work on.
1,"First the rant:  My not-very-old laptop developed several problems simultaneously, and I decided to just buy a new one, assuming I could move my Office Pro 2010 to the new machine.  Unfortunately, Microsoft said \\""no\\""!  Turns out it was licensed for only one computer and they did not care if your computer crashed the next day after you bought it.  Your bad luck.  I see that they have backed down on that - the description for the new software says you may move it from one computer to another.<br /><br />I made do with the Word and Excel starter on the new laptop, but Publisher is my go-to software, and it really galled me to have to buy it.  I even looked for other software to replace it but couldn't find anything that would convert my old files.<br /><br />So, now for the review:  It took about 1.5 hours to download (I have a fairly slow connection) and only a few minutes to install.  It looks quite different from 2010, but so far using it has been fairly intuitive.  There are some changes in how it operates, but I like the ones that I have encountered.  For the most part the changes I have seen correct awkward steps.  For example, when you click in a text box there is a new menu Text Box Tools menu that you can access with many of the functions that used to be hidden several levels down in various menus.<br /><br />In all fairness, I have not yet done any graphics-heavy publications.  If I encounter problems as described by some of the reviewers I will amend this review.<br /><br />So, I like the software.  Still not too crazy about Microsoft."
1,Use this daily. Keeps me on track with billminder. When preparing for tax time  I had everything at my fingertips ready for my cpa
1,Buying this online made it easy to download and get my taxes done quick!<br />I am happy with the product.
1,I have always used Norton.  It is nice that it is now an easy download.  Little to make your life easier.
0,"Tying every single account to an email is a pain in the ass. This is the most anti-small business version of all time. If the IT guy registers it to his email, he owns the copy. Zero security."
1,"Great product! However, there are some glitches. It will hang up a quit unexpectedly. If you sync to mobile, the budget can change which is annoying.<br /><br />Owned for 4 months.<br />Would recommend even with glitches"
1,"After using a CPA for my entire tax paying life, I was skeptical about completing and filing my own return. The difference between the cost of my CPA and Turbo Tax was enough to push me off the fence. Now I wonder why I waited so long to make the switch. I had no problems downloading or installing the program. Although I did not encounter any problems with the e-file feature as some people report, I decided to print and mail my state return to save another 20 bucks.<br /><br />The only reason that I rated this 4 stars out of 5 is the rigidity of the program. My CPA had used a different form to deduct some of my itemized expenses and since I used my previous return as a guide I was worried about the end result. In the end, I don't know that it matters as my refund was in the ballpark as the previous year's.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to my friends and plan on using the program in the future as well."
0,"Buggy software.  It corrupted my data twice already.  I had to go back to the backup and enter/download all transactions again.  I am in the similar profession (software development), cannot imagine for the life of me, how this passed QA and released for general public."
1,It fits our needs.  We would recommend it to anyone in need of a similar product.  Easy to keep updated.
1,Nice product. Very reliable download. Fast way to do your taxes. I like TurboTax products. You can't go wrong using this product.
1,Quick & Easy!!
1,Love AVAST.  I have used it on Multiple computers for 10 years or more.  I will not consider any other anti virus software. Thanks!
1,This has always  been one of my favorite pieces of software for working with and making graphics  I recommend it for all levels of experience.
0,It's so difficult to download after the purchase. I think Norton does it on purpose because you buy it someplace other than from them. It changes on how to download it every year. It's very frustrating. A great price but get ready to spend some time on your computer.lol.
1,I love the fact that it always updates itself. I have been without any problems and it has kept my PC running smoothly since I installed it.
1,Very satisfied with this years TurboTax offering.  Several problems in the previous versions have been addressed and feel the 2012 version is working very well.
1,"Quick, reliable and accurate ! Probably my 10th year using Turbo Tax! ! ! ! !"
0,I'm not sure how long ago Intuit set up a management team that holds the belief they can horribly treat their customers and get away with it.
1,"The software does not list security in one acct.<br />For example you have same security in 2 or 3 accts,it lists all of it in each acct.<br />It is difficult to figure Cost Basis in this situation.<br />Please let me know if there is a way to resolve this.May be I am missing something.<br />Thanks,"
1,"TurboTax made it easy and convenient for me to confidently complete and submit my Federal and State Tax returns for 2012. I would probably not have needed the Premier version to handle my limited stock transactions (SOP & RSU), but the step by step process made it easy, and I was able to connect directly with my broker to download the tax documents instead of type in the information. The most time consuming part was looking up and typing in the addresses of every charity that I claimed a deduction for (not the fault of TurboTax). The bottom line (refund / amount due) was very similar to last years return, completed by a CPA. I have not tried any other Tax programs."
1,"Cool free download. Awesome Antivirus, a years worth! Great value! Will be downloading again next year! I had all of my family download it as well!"
0,"I heeded the warnings and did not purchase Turbo Tax this year.  I purchased H&R Block Deluxe and had a great number of problems trying to enter in-kind charitable contributions. Block claims to carryover last year's entries from Turbo Tax, but if you attempt to edit and bring up to date, all the information disappears. It must be re-entered. Long wait to speak to customer service and the agents did not know how to solve the problem. They shuffled me into oblivion. So be aware.    I need to add that I felt compelled to purchase Turbo Tax to reuse all my past data since H&R Block can't, despite their claim to the contrary."
0,We had to pay $32.48 to Intuit for an upgrade to Premier in order to pay our taxes. The &#34;free upgrade&#34; that was supposed to be available did not work.
0,I was very disappointed to get to the very last step of efiling and discover that TurboTax wanted $20 more for the (calif.) state efile<br />I &#34;assumed&#34; that paying extra for the state portion included state efiling.<br />So I went to ftb.ca.gov and did an efile for no cost.<br />AND I could choose to pay by credit card (via Official Payments) - Not an option in turbo tax.<br /><br />Again disappointed with the &#34;ransomware&#34; approach to the $20 State efiling fee and no &#34;pay (CA) State with a credit card&#34; option.<br /><br />KP
1,I am not a qualified critic but Avast seems to be doing the job.  It updates are regular so I feel I am well protected.
0,the dam thing don't work it wont see the audio files on a dvd I want my money back
0,"The program just needs to be updated. The games/graphics and interface are all straight out of the mid-nineties. Also, after you've reached &#34;advanced,&#34; it starts repeating lessons. I'm not sure if it's worth the $15 I paid for it. I'd recommend something more modern. Nevertheless, I can type 60 WPM, and the program was engaging and fun."
1,"I was kind of forced into getting Quicken 2013 when Quicken 2010 stopped downloading transactions from my bank and credit cards. 2013 works very well. There are some screen differences, but after a short time I'm doing everything I could do with the previous version."
1,"Been using it for years, east to use.  This year it felt a little off and like they were trying to upsell me more items and more aggressively this time."
1,Thank God.  Lost every picture on my external hard drive.  Glad I had the Cloud....
1,"I've been using this software for over a year now & I really rate it.  It does exactly what it says on the tin by creating a sitemap of your site & then submitting it to the major Search Enigines.  All of this can be done automatically without any intervention from you (I run mine weekly).  It's easy to set up & the supporting Help documentation is good.  But best of all is the customer support... without doubt some of the best I've come across.  Any issues can be Emailed to the support team & you'll get a clear, concise reply within hours.  First rate!"
1,"As in the past this product is absolutely easiest to install, runs in the background without any interference or requirement for inputs."
0,"Only reason I give it a 0ne star is because I cannot write a review with giving it something.  Quicken 2015 for windows does not work! When you click the one step download for your bank, the cursor simply goes away and you cannot do any functions with you computer at that point. Tried calling, but updated phone message says to go on line for all the help you need. Was on the chat line for almost an hour.  Chat line hasn't got a clue. Sends me to 'MONDO' patch which does nothing. Now I can't download from my bank to balance my personal or business accounts.<br /> NO RESPONSE from Quicken yet!<br /> Don't buy it!!!!!!"
1,It has saved me much time and effort using this product.  Highly recommend it. I wish that have known it before.
1,"For a free antivirus I am amazed at how well Avast functions, making me feel safe online at all times. The updates are not intrusive, its easy to use and all around a great program!"

0,"Have used TTD for the last 5 years. Getting ready to buy 2014 TTD, started reading the reviews about the capital gains and now I am going to order HRB. Thanks for the revealing reviews. Will be telling all my fellow employes about this and tell them to switch to HRB. Advise everyone that reads these reviews to do the same. Refuse to believe that they had no choice but to remove the capital gains from the Deluxe.. They must think we are stuck on stupid. If they could not figure a way to keep it in, they don't belong in the software writing business."

It has a lot of great tools, but flipping between the pdf manual and the program was a pain until I learned some basic concepts. I still find the work area too crowded. Overall, though, I love it."
0,"I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.<br /><br />Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.<br /><br />In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.<br /><br />Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.<br /><br />The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.<br /><br />Happy Motoring!"
1,Worked great. Will get again.
0,"No big improvement over 2011.  Installed 7014 and now I can not download from my Vanguard brokerage account.  Spent 2 hours with Quicken help and was told it is a Vanguard problem. Oh well, program not worth the upgrade cost."
1,"What can I say, Norton can be a bloatware, but its bloatware with features I like at a good price. I have 3 units covered for a year - this was a screaming deal.  The security and identity features are good. Can't say I've every used the back-up; the software appears to be backing up, but I have no idea what would happen if I actually needed to *extract* the data. The tune up is just OK.  I do recommend this software to newbies, because it can keep a lot of bad nasties at bay, without requiring the user to think about it too much."
1,"Perhaps, I am not the one to review this product? I purchase every Adobe Elements update and at this point I have more features in this product then in the first Adobe Photoshop I purchased during the first reign of the Egyptian pharaohs. It is an amazing photo processing program. Easier to maneuver on a PC then a MAC, but still a great program."
1,I DOWNLOAD AVAST LONG TIME AGO MY DAUGHTER RECOMMENDED TO ME AND SINCE THEN I HAVE NOT BEING HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY COMPUTER.
1,"Very good product, easy user interface, and clean polished look. Has kept my valuable gaming computer free of all those bandwith and processor sapping programs and cookies. Computer scan seems to do a pretty in depth scan as well."
1,"Found little difference between 2013 & 2015.<br />Had problem saving info. Earlier version would automatically asked if you wanted to save, allow you to connect and save and then disconnect.  New version does not do this.<br />Hopefully you can help."
0,"This critical review is regarding Intuit's return process, and not the Quickbooks product itself.<br /><br />I purchased the downloadable version of QuickBooks 2013 for MAC for my small business on 24 February, primarily for financial reporting and invoicing purposes. Unfortunately QuickBooks 2013 would not launch on my early Intel based 2007 Mac-Mini, since our MAC OS is version OSX 10.6 (My bad for not checking the specs carefully.) I found out that an OS upgrade for my 2007 MAC Mini is not an option, so I immediately contacted Amazon customer support to obtain a refund.<br /><br />While Amazon customer support was helpful, he explained that Amazon couldn't directly refund my purchase since the item was electronically downloaded.  Instead, his email directed me to a link to the Intuit Web page with the return process. The Intuit return web page, under the section \\""Returning Electronically Delivered Products\\"" states that you can asks for a refund \\""Via the web\\"", but directs you to a \\""My Accounts\\"" login page where you have to have an existing Intuit customer account to access. From this point, you are forced to contact Intuit support by phone at 888-859-4056, which directs you to a Philippines based call center.<br /><br />After two calls, support was able to create a user login for the Intuit site and I was finally able to login. I thought there would be an online web form to complete for the refund. Wrong! Instead, they direct you to contact Intuit Support via email at ereturns@intuit.com !  Jumping through yet another hoop, I forwarded my request for the refund, along with my proof of purchase & license key per the instructions to the ereturns@intuit.com email address.<br /><br />From this point the request appeared to disappear into the ether for a couple weeks, until I received an email from Patricia on 3/12 from the \\""Order Management Team\\"" at Intuit, verifying that they would process my refund, as soon as they had my mailing address, and promising a response within 24 hours that they were going to process a check. I provided the mailing address as requested, but the promised acknowledgment of \\""A check is in the mail\\"" was never received. My phone calls to the direct phone number remain unanswered, so I have no idea of the status of my refund at this time, despite trying for almost a month.<br /><br />From a customer point of view, the Intuit return process is at the very least broken, or designed to discourage those seeking their 60 day money back Guaranty. I would recommend that any potential purchasers consider the physical media instead of the downloaded version, if you want to have the option of returning a product that doesn't work for you. Thanks Intuit, for making my first experience with you painful, unproductive, and expensive. I will not be recommending your products in the future.<br /><br />*Update - I did receive the refund for the product, thanks Intuit. IMO - most of the angst could have been prevented by responding to, rather than ignoring emails and phone calls. Most people would give you the benefit of the doubt if you tell them (1) the customer's requests matter and we hear you, and (2) yeah, we are working on it, and you will have it within xx days. Take this as constructive criticism."
0,"I purchased this at Costco, should not have purchased it at all.  Turbo tax was fine once upon a time, but now it's just a scam to take as much money as possible while providing the least value.  I could have prepared my taxes myself in the amount of time it took to go through Turbo tax.  The true cost of the software is not obvious at first because even the 'delux' version doesn't support basic tax circumstances ... the software WILL force you to throw it away or upgrade to premium, and then you'll get charged again for your state e-file.  The name of the game is bait and switch - offer you one purchase price, but take more money as you enter more data into the software.  By the time you get to the end, you've already spent hours entering your information and you're ready to quit, so you're that much more likely to pay the extra fees to upgrade or e-file, since this software is pretty much useless without those features.  It's a scam and as a former long-time turbotax user I'm pretty pissed.  Even if they improve their software and stop gouging people and lying about the features you get for the original purchase price, I will never again be their customer."
1,"This utility works so well, it puts any iolos System Mechanics to shame. can't say enough how it helps pc care"
0,"Just upgraded from Quicken Premier 2013.  Performance on Windows 7 the same, almost no new features besides getting a free credit score which anyone with a Discover IT card gets anyway.  Still has about the same bugs as before.  If it were not for the dropping of support for online account sync for Quicken more than 3 years old there would be almost no reason to upgrade."
1,"Easy to download.  No problems, great price."
0,"I installed a trial version of KIS 2015 on my brand new Surface Pro 3.  KIS had me disable the Microsoft Defender and Firewall.  Since then I had issues with the computer locking up and crashing.  I called up Microsoft support and after a few things tried, they suggested uninstalling KIS.  I did that and Microsoft was unable to reload Defender and Firewall.  After 5 hours on the phone to MS Support (they are not very good), I had to send my computer back to MS and get a new one.  My new new computer no longer locks up or crashes and has defender and firewall working.  Microsoft said that for most people a third party security program is not needed, and may just cause problems.  Bottom line, I spent well over 10 hours (MS support and re-building the computer) due to KIS.  I won't go there again."
1,"I have used Mcafee, Norton and others, and Norton tends to be what I keep returning to.  Using this with the latest of OS X systems without problems."
1,I've used it before and i haven't bought it because its in a system and its really good its got 3d paint
0,"At first my product was syncing my bank and credit card online accounts perfectly, now it's off by thousands of dollars.  Also, almost every time I open the program there is an update, I wish they would have just got it right the first time.  I bought the program the week it officially came out (october 2012) and apparently it was still in Beta even though I was told it was the official program.  I am really not impressed...I think I would rather go back to using Excel spreadsheets for my budgeting."
1,I think Avast is the best and so do some of my friends.  We like. My children also have it on their devices.
0,"I was formerly a most satisfied customer of Quicken (and Turbo-Tax) from their beginnings. I could have done commercials for the products!  No longer.  I was forced to pay for a Quicken upgrade (with an insulting $10 discount) if I wanted to continue to use the feature of bank downloads.  I paid the price, and then had significant problems with the upgrade itself - I resolved myself after about three hours of uninstalling, installing, restoring, etc. Now I am not able to download bank or credit card activity correctly, if at all.  Today, my download for one bank account included transactions from 6 months ago (already recorded and reconciled).  From another account, nothing would download - and there are about a dozen transactions that should have downloaded.  I had to enter everything manually. What sort of customer service/marketing advice is Intuit currently employing? Do not buy this product.  When I work up the energy to switch to another product, I will.  If I could give this product negative stars, I would!"
0,Will not buy turbo tax again due to problems
1,I will never use Turbo Tax again. Great deal
1,"Easy to use, Once you get over the learning curve... it's quite simple to put everything together, and it also takes less time to render a movie than other bigger software."
0,"Came with ware, by that I mean it came with this weird uninstaller sub for the normal windows uninstaller, not sure if this is considered bloatware, adware or something else.But it uses disk space, something my laptop doesn't have much of."
1,Great product have been using this product for years. The new version of software is better meant for new faster PC's. I would not recommend on older xp computers etc. the hardware resources on older computers are to low for software to operate correctly.
1,"I have been a devoted user of Avast AntiVirus since 2003. I found it on a random search and installed it during a very frugal period. It has gone on every personal PC and Mac I've owned since then. I even convinced my small business employer to install Avast pro as well.<br /><br />It just WORKS and you don't have to worry about it. It updates automatically and they don't nickel and dime you for new subscriptions. It is the most proactive software I have ever had and I spent years in the corporate and personal sector with Symantec, Nortons. I even tried AVG and and a few other 'freebies'; always something would get through and I would be scrambling in re-active mode to clean my system and my network before an infection spread.  I have never, ever, EVER had to do that on any machine or network protected by Avast--11 years and counting.<br /><br />I bought a new Acer laptop for Christmas with Windows 8. The first thing I did was delete the anti-virus software that came with it and installed Avast."
1,"Going back over 10 years, I started mindmapping by drawing them out on a piece of paper as taught by Tony Buzan. I did not really tap into the power of until I starting using early software such as Inspiration. For the past 5 years, I've come to dependent on them as a primary planning tool. Aside from Inspiration, I've used Mindjet, theBrain, XMind, Dropmind, Freemind, SimpleMind, and several others over the years.<br /><br />MindMaple is my favorite Mindmapping tool currently. It is not perfect, but it does a great job overcoming the deficiencies that I've often experienced with the other tools I've mentioned. Highlights:<br /><br />** Good performance across different platforms. The iPad version which I sync with the Desktop version I'm reviewing here matches the latter's functionality. Moreover, while there is some lag it is way more tolerable than other iPad mindmaps I've used. Some apps just freeze up when the mindmap becomes huge. If I can't use it on an iPad, the Desktop version is quite a bit less appealing to me.<br /><br />** Functionally beautiful...Clean and organized. Through the use of themes, MindMaple overcomes a major issue I see with other Mindmaps. When they get big, they get messy and really hard to follow. It becomes harder to distinguish between nodes and relationships overlap. Mindmap does a great job of self-organizing via it's default settings. I spend less time manually formatting to keep track of things.<br /><br />** Related mindmaps in a single file. With Mindmaple you can have more than one Mindmap in a single file which makes is nice when you have Mindmaps that are related to one-another. I've not run across another product with this same feature.<br /><br />** Amazing customer support. It has wonderful working with a U.S. based team (although developers are in other parts of the world) that gives you detailed responses both via email and phone, as opposed to canned copy and paste answers.<br /><br />** Notes with display \\""on\\"" and \\""off\\"" feature. In the desktop version, you can not only add notes, but you can choose to display or hide them. This is important when I'm in the midst of the project and need to remind myself of different things.<br /><br />When you're working with Mindmaps at a basic level, all the the products out there seem pretty similar. But when we're with big complicated Mindmaps, incorporating tasks, projects, and multiple relationships, the men are separated from the boys. So for me, Mindmaple survives that kind of torture testing.<br /><br />I could say more, but you get the idea. MindMaple, from what I can see is not well-known but I think they are an innovator that I think they will get them a spot among the biggies. I say that because I have been a long time user of one of the most respected industrial strength mindmaps out there.\\"" feature.

1,"Everything works flawlessly especially syncing with ipad and iPhone.  However, quicken sounds won't work with new installation, only with an upgrade where sounds are already working.  So far there is no fix from intuit.  What a shame!"
1,Seems to work great.
0,The product may be fine however when I downloaded it to install from a DVD the install will not work.  I ended up having to call Microsoft who charged me for another version of same product but their product installed
1,"Wow! This is SO much easier than Ghost ever was. I frequently download giveaways from various sites and occasionally uninstalling one of those buggers doesn't 'go right'. With RollBack Pro, no problem! I've got my original system (Win 7 Pro) with all it's relevant proggies set to go.  And Bob's your uncle! This program has saved me a number of forced re-installs of Windows."
0,I have used Quicken since 1999 and have been quite happy until the 2014 upgrade.  My program has crashed and won't restore.  I have spent 5 hours using the online chat method of solving my problem to no avail.  I have had computer professionals unable to restore my program.  I am sure that Quicken will fix the bugs in the next 90 days but why would they release such a poor product that destroys their loyal customers records?
1,"They could improve on the navigation, however, I got the free version and for that I give it 4 stars.  You can't beat the price and it did all I needed it to do.  My tax return was simple this year.  If yours is simple I recommend this product.  Thank you TaxAct for putting a free version out there.  Turbo Tax has gone way over board with their pricing.  This is my third year with TaxAct."
1,"I have had all the main antivirus software and services. Over 15 years I have only had one that did not slow the machine and still caught all potential attacks before they infected several different machines. OS's from 98, ME, Vista, 7, 8. all covered and.......... it is free. I refer it to all my friends and anyone in earshot. I was so pleased that I sent a donation in the early days. Now I will just pay for a upgrade. I'm a cheap skate so this is a big step. Enjoy and relax. Olympic gold to Avast ! Paul the Soundman."
1,"I had a nüvi 660 that this did not work on.  Amazon graciously gave me a refund, but that 660 broke not long after, so I got a nüvi 2595LMT and bought this again.  It works perfectly on it.  The kids enjoy it on trips."
1,"I moved over from Windows to Mac many years ago. Once I switched the one replacement I couldn't find was one for Quicken. I tried them all, even used a few for a while, but never had the same experience as I had with Quicken. Once I saw that Qiucken 2015 was out, I downloaded it and within 15 minutes all of my checking, savings, investment and retirement accounts were set up and synced and the reports told me more than any other software I had used in between. I'm happy. For my day to day use it works perfectly."
1,works as advertised
1,used Turbo for years...love and depend on them!
0,"It really doesn't have the &#34;business&#34; part unless you pay for the upgrade. It does download bank account information easily, which is nice. The auto catagorizing is a nice feature too."
0,"Ugh. I really want to make this work, but I have such a time trying to figure out how to do the simplest of things with this software. I wanted to do an auto correct on about 30 photos at once, but could not figure it out and gave up after an hour. I went to MS Windows Live Gallery, imported the folder with the pictures, selected the pictures, and hit autocorrect ... done. I admit that Photoshop can work miracles, but for me, they are few and far between. And, Premiere Elements? Only a dream of how that works! Good luck!"
0,"I read their privacy policy before installing. It includes gems like:<br /><br />&#34;We may collect personal information in connection with providing you information about various healthcare programs and health insurance options. This information may include information about your health, health insurance status and financial information related to payment for healthcare services.&#34;<br /><br />Read the rest then decide. I went for another option with a better privacy policy, but it's your call."
0,This download is awful. i recommend not buying it because it wont install and amazon wont give you your money back or fix the problem. I recommend just buying the actual CD and installing it.
1,"My second year using this product...intuitive interface, up to date, and very easy to use. I particularly like the interaction avaialble between Federal and State returns...wee designed!"
1,"Reviewing Amazon's side of the transaction (that so many reviewers are complaining about) as much as the actual product.  Bought this today during the Prime Day promotion.  I currently have an expired trial version of Lightroom CC and Photoshop CC on my computer.  I was prepared to have to call Adobe to deal with issues regarding them receivin notice of my subscription via Amazon, or some similar issue.  I had no problems!!!  Made the purchase right before leaving home, came back 5 hours later and my Adobe CC software had already registered the subscription and all features were again unlocked.  Excellent.  Lightroom as a product is of course awesome too.  Robust set of features to edit my photos, and excellent to edit large batches of photos, as well as just organize them."
1,We've used TurboTax for years. I feel like it helps remind us of what we owe and what we are allowed to deduct.
0,"I downloaded this program SOLELY for the purpose of e-filing a request for an extension of my US taxes (I live out of the country and was unable to complete my forms by the deadline of 6/15). Not until I opened and got to the end of the filing process did the program tell me I was not allowed to e-file an extension. Other programs are perfectly capable of such actions, so there was zero reason for me to believe H&R Block couldn't do it.     I've purchased H&R Block programs since the Intuit spyware debacle in the early 2000s. Never again. Not only will I never use an H&R Block product again, I will cease to recommend them. If I could return the program for a refund, I would do it in an instant; it's already been removed from my computer."
1,"I recently graduated from college and decided I needed help keeping up with my finances and creating a budget. So far, this product has been great. It's easy to use and they layout is easy to read."
1,"I've been using the product for year or so and have never had a problem with it, but if I had a question about a project I was working on, they were there to help...... It's a great product for \\""A LOT\\"" of different project's. plus it's fun to experiment with."
0,"So disappointed in AVG! I downloaded a free trial of AVG Zen and it messed up my security software license.  My security license was supposed to expire one year from date of purchase. However, it is currently disabled and showing me &#34;expired license.&#34; This expiration coincided with the expiration of my trial version of AVG Zen. I uninstalled the Zen trial but my Antivirus still showed it was expired. I knew it was a glitch, because I purchased a one year license so I contacted support and spent 20 minutes on chat with them.<br /><br />I tried to explain the colossal error and expect he would fix it, but finally gave up when all he could do was confirm that, &#34;yes&#34; my license should be good but would I like to buy a renewal?<br /><br />What? Umm, what?  No, I don't want to buy a new license right now, I want the one I currently have to work until it's supposed to. I finally gave up. And came here to write a review... I'd be wary of downloading any trials unless you want to commit to buying them, because I am proof  - they will screw up your current license expiration date if you don't."
0,Got the Creative Toolbox 5 thinking that this would unlock a lot of the potential of my soundblaster audio card but didn't give me much in the ways that the old Windows XP drivers did...so spent a lot odf money for nothing. Maybe in hindsight should of spent the money on a new better supported sound card.
1,"Intuitive and useful. I'm not an accountant, but, the tutorials helped me understand how to set up my business and do basic tasks. There are still some challenges to using it, though, if you don't have accounting experience."
0,I am hoping that this year's version is more accurate than last years which was a $4000 error.
0,"The Quicken program is fundamental to my financial activity and record keeping. It is a useful program, but not perfect. There are a few competitors, but they are flawed as well. I did not appreciate being forced to update to keep the ability to do auto downloads from my financial institutions."
0,This software conflicted with both Windows 7 and 8 on two different computers. I had to remove and get &#34;paid&#34; antivirus protection. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Use it every year to do include e-filing the family taxes with no problems...easy to update using previous year's file...first year doing LLC taxes with the program...will update if I encounter any problems with LLC taxes.
0,"My kids, ages 6 and 12 neither one liked it. One thought it was too young, one thought it was boring. Was not the tool I was looking for."
0,I bought this product on line downloaded it and have never been able to use it. Call Amazon who refer me to the company that produced the software. I have written to them twice without any response. Please do not buy this product.
0,"Ripped me off this last year, though I used them for several years before that with no problem. Filling out the forms is fine, especially if you do your bookkeeping with Quicken, from the same company. When everything was finished and I tried to file, I was told my forms had been sent, then was notified that they had not gone through. An outfit called Hitek Squad, in cooperation with TurboTax, cleaned up files (not viruses or malware) on my computer, demanded $150 and then filed the forms. That was on top of the cost of the program. I won't be using TurboTax again."
0,"Worked as adverstized.  What they didn't tell you was that this program disables Restore Piont, which would not let my computer install windows updates, as well as others.  I uninstalledRollBack RX Pro.  I will not reinstall it again.  I can't recomend this program.  I was happy with it when I first installed it.  If it didn't disable restore points and I could install Windows updated I would love it."

0,"As I write this, I've been on hold 54 minutes for technical support.  The automated system hung up after the first 44 minutes on hold. Unfortunately the online version of the software seems to have an unrecoverable system error    The various internet knowledge bases don't address the error message \\""An error has occurred on screen HomeDialog\\""    I've been a turbo tax customer for over 15 years and impressed with the continuous improvements in the software each year. This year's program seemed to offer similar improvements. After 4 hours, I was nearly done with a complicated federal return which had many investment, business and deduction transactions... then the software crashed.    With this many years of experience (15+ years) with this program, I can confidently say that this is not a user error. It's not evident yet if my online tax data is recoverable.  At some point the wait for technical support will exceed the time invested to fill out the return.    Update:     20 minutes after I wrote this I got through on customer service.  The service rep didn't recognize the problem and (I hope) accidentally hung up.  I don't have the patience to wait on hold another 50 minutes.  I tried the automated \\""ask Tina\\"" option.  There was no information in \\""ask Tina.\\""  I will try email.    Update:    I tried the Live Community and found this answer, \\""Why do I have to wait 1.5 hours on hold to reach customer support; TT tells me it encountered an error and must close. Instructs me to tell Microsoft but tells me nothing about how to fix the problem.\\""    Update:  I received an automated email response.  \\""Please expect a personalized response from a TurboTax representative within the timeframe indicated on the submission page.\\""  The support site indicates a 48 hour turn around on emails."
0,"Personal version works fine, business doesn't work at all and is buggy as hell. Crashes for me every time when I try to open saved return that I did 70% of, and going to backed up versions doesn't work either. Some error messages with asset forms, forms with draft status, etc - and it feels like no one bothered to redo business program framework in 10+ years, feels like it's a Windows 3.1 software.<br /><br />So decent personal (I've been using it for many years without any issues) but completely unusable business. I really don't want to buy TurboTax business Fed+State for $200, if they don't fix this POS I'll probably just have a CPA do my return for close to that price."
1,"Can swap computers easily even if they are in different locations.  Safe Sync is actually kinda cool (still free at this point) It can be synced with Android devices which is useful.    I don't like that as far as I can tell, all 3 computers share one login email/pw.  Which is kinda fellatious if you ask me.  I dont necessarily use all 3 machines exclusively and am not willing to share my trend login, ya know?    The AV does seem to work; at least it flags all the development tools for Android that are not malware but essentially are the same diff.      Not as intrusive and bloated as the usual offenders (Norton AVG et al.)    If you can get it as an online download for cheap, totally worth it."
0,It sucks
1,"I have used Laplink to migrate my PC systems a number of times already, XP to XP, XP to Vista, XP to Windows 7 and Vista to Windows 7. The last transfer took 20 hours of PC to PC time, but I needed approximately 1 hour of my own time. The transfers are always as near perfect as you can reasonable expect, and appart from the need to reenter a password here and there the new system works 'out of the box'. A truly tremendous piece of software and a nvery real time saver!"
0,will not buy this one again.
1,"Very pleased so far.  Enjoying that resources are not slowed near as much.  Average scan takes about a minute.  Longest about 2 minutes-initially.  Have used Norton (several versions probably the longest of any), ZoneAlarm Extreme most recently for last few years, Viper, McAfee...so far this Webroot has installed and run the easiest.  Boots and shuts down much faster.  Hopefully I won't need them, BUT, I like that Customer Service is in Colorado - USA.  :-)"
0,I was. Unable to instal this program on my iMac. Apple help desk couldn't help it does work with the last updates
0,Would not install onto my computer because it was missing components.  Not refundable either.
1,Love Turbo Tax. Very easy to use. Second year to use and will continue to use. I have told my siblings about Turbo Tax and they have started using it as well. It has saved us lots of money. Thanks Turbo Tax!
1,"Awesome antivirus, I used to use the window antivirus, the Mccafee and both of them didn't work, until I bought The Norton 360 it got ready of the viruses and a very annoying search engine (SAFESEARCH) that acts like a virus and infects your search engines.  Great product for the money."
0,"I bought the product not once, but twice; and both times encountered the same result. Upon trying to upgrade, I received a popup message telling me that the key code was invalid. Shocked, I called Microsoft where they confirmed that the code I had bought from Amazon was not a valid code! I called Amazon, where the nightmare began. Their representative told me that this \\""occasionally happens\\"". So, Amazon has knowledge that sometimes a code they sell returns that \\""invalid\\"" message - for whatever reason. Knowing that to be the case, Amazon should have simply cancelled my credit card charge and allowed me to get another. Instead, they informed me that the card charge would be credited back and show up in a few days. With their assurance, I purchased the item a second time. the exact same thing happened. Needless to say, I was at this point not a very happy camper. Amazon agreed to do a second return of my money which would show up in a few days. In the many years I have been a faithful Amazon customer I have never had such a distasteful experience. It seems to me that with the knowledge they had of the \\""occasional\\"" problem, they should have fashioned an exception to their normal policy for crediting charges back. Imagine, I could have conceivably bought this item three, four, five times over and had to wait days for my money back."
1,great
1,"The down load went good .<br />The problem I had was the back up file I used to re inter all of my transactions for the last 7 or 8 years must have be corrupted .<br />Every time I opened Quicken it wanted to start over .asking if I was A new subscriber or If I had an account to back up from .<br />After the third time I called Quicken to help withe this . They seed it  would be no problem , that my back up disk must be corrupted .<br />And that there Technetium could fix it for A small price . 2 years service for $400 one year for $200 or A one time fix for $170 .<br />I was thoroughly upset I had spent $70 on there product and they seed it was not the Quicken download that was bad ,but my Disk.<br />Rather than spend any more money on Technical Services . I opted  to start over as A new start up . I spent the next couple of Hours re setting up the Accounts and Updates Budgets Life Planing and I manged to get most of this years Transactions downloaded from my Bank .<br />All in all that made more scene to my than pay for them to make there product to work.<br /><br />Quicken is A good product but there support is RATEABLE I have had many problems withe them over the last 7 or 8 yeas .<br />I had there on line backup for years and then it stopped working they fixed it once then the next week it would not work again .<br />Then they stopped doing E mail support [ at that time it was almost imposable to  get there phone number] after several months<br />My subscription to there backup ran out  .<br /><br />As long as every thing works for you it great but if you have problems GOOD LUCK ."
1,I downloaded this on both of my computers with no problems. I purchased this at a great price & recommend it.
1,"I bought the product as a download, i installed it on two pc's and it is running seemingly thereafter. It offers password protection and many cool features. And it looks great too!"
0,this thing caused my pc to crash & like to have never got it to go again.People beware don't take a change just go to store & buy u one.
0,I just got a new computer and decided that instead of transferring current data and application I would start new with the latest Quicken. I got quicken because I have been using it for more years than I can count. I like it because it does everything I need including transfer tax relate information to Turbotax.
1,We give it a 4.5 star rating it was easy to use.
1,It doesn't slow down to much my computer and provides updated protection on most critical aspects.
0,"I am not a very tech savvy person, I'll admit.  But this program is a complete waste of money.  It will not download properly from my bank, will not recognize downloads from my credit card companies, it will not \\""easily\\"" convert my old MS Money files to Quicken.  All representations made by the advertising appear to be baloney.  Wanted a refund, but bought the downloaded version, so it's not possible.  Total garbage.  Save your money."
1,good deal
1,TurboTax is very user friendly and I recommend it to all my friends.
1,The transfer was extremely easy and the flow of the 2015 program is smooth.  Love it!
1,Very intuitive and easy to use.<br />Best pricing is found on Amazon.<br />It would still be easier if we just ALL paid 10%!<br />Straight tax ... Simple and easy.
0,"After having used Norton Internet Security for years, I thought I'd see what the fuss is all about with Kaspersky. What a mistake that was.<br /><br />This thing has been nothing but trouble since I installed it, blocking me from sites like Google, Gmail, and every possible safe site on the web.<br /><br />I've tinkered with the settings for hours, searching for answers online, but nothing worked. I've worked with PCs for 30 years, so I have a little bit of experience with this stuff. So what's a newbie to do?<br /><br />A good security program should work behind the scene and stay unobtrusive. This has thrown me back to the stone age of PC security when everything was so complicated.<br /><br />What a waste of money. I'm going to order the new Norton Security now and throw this junk in the garbage where it belongs."
0,Really not happy with this product. Sadly the free version worked better regarding saving projects and exporting movies than the purchased version. Have sent in three requests for support however none forthcoming at the time of this review. I will update if I get any assistance with this product.
1,"Works great.  It comes with one voice.  I would have liked to have had the option of choosing which one.  Other than that, it works well for me."
1,I'm an independent filmmaker and I've been using HitFilm for a while. The software is great and easy to use. FxHome's customer service is at a personal level. 5 stars for this product.
1,"it is easy to download AND it did not take that much time.good for individual laptops and who don't need more than one user, perfect for mac air cause u would not have to use a CD. cheaper. I would really recommended it."
1,"I use Connectify Hotspot in the classroom to distribute files to my students during labs.  The kids connect to the hotspot and Connectify creates a simple web site where they can find course materials.    I was googling for an easy way to distribute files wirelessly, and stumbled on this site:    [...]    Connectify has also come in handy for getting my (own) kid's ipods and videogames online during long trips.  I can share my verizon aircard as a hotspot in the car.  Pretty neat!"
0,"Having read about Schedule's C removal from this year's addition and Intuit's response of the free upgrade I figured it would be fine and I'd figure out an alternate next year. Well, I was wrong. First off, they updated the system requirements. You need a min of MacOS 10.7 – so I can’t even run it. After I called I was told the only option was to do it online which I didn’t want to do. They said they’d give me a code to upgrade to premier and another to file a 2nd return (disk allows 5). Since the rep would need to get someone else involved to get the codes for me I told them I’d think about it and call back. Which I did last night. After 10 minutes on hold my call was dropped. Called again and spoke with a couple of people. After 104 minutes on the phone, yes, that’s One Hundred Four minutes, I found out, that premier wouldn’t let me do the schedule C which I needed, (and have used on Deluxe going back to ’06) and they wouldn’t provide me an upgrade to the necessary version. For years I’ve been telling people how happy I was with TurboTax. Well, no more. I couldn’t be less happy. I don’t know how the number of people necessary to institute these changes could all agree this was a good idea. It is a total FAIL.  I’m off to H&R Block’s Tax Software (Tax Act which is rated higher is only available for PCs) and I’m sure I’ll have a much easier time completing my taxes than TurboTax will have of ever getting me back as a customer, let alone brand advocate."
0,"I have used Turbo Tax software ever since I started electronic filing. I was surprised to see such a low rating for the deluxe version but after reading many of these reviews, I have decided not to purchase any Turbo Tax product for filing my 2014 tax returns."
0,"Just got Macs and researched Essentials and iBank5. Watched the John Schneider Essentials youtube and reluctantly decided to go with Essentials as both products have 2 star Amazon summary reviews. Got tired of wading thru lots of nonverified purchase 5 star shill reviews (imo) for both products.<br />Despite the Intuit website help tab claiming the ability to import data from Quicken 2010 for Windows,  I wasted half a day and gave up. I followed the detailed instructions on the Intuit site and was able to create a QIF file that conformed to the stated conversion requirements but Essentials would not take it. Thus, we are starting from scratch on Essentials manually entering data from 1/1/14 and forward. Was able to download the most recent partial second quarter of data from our bank (Schwab), but could not go back and download the first quarter of 2014. Have not yet attempted to set up accounts, message the bank data, or do a reconciliation. We are early in the process. I can sum this product up with the Biblical addage, in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king."
1,"Great Product, in terms of level of protection, ease of installation and updating.  They often prompt you to subscribe to the paid service which is fair enough.  Just watch what you click.  It has become more intrusive than it was: warnings popping up from the bottom right corner of your screen a couple of times a day.  Just click no."
1,Best Free Antivirus. I have not had any problems with it.  It stays up to date. I recommend it for any one.
0,"Installed this software and ran it once, didn't get a chance to learn whether it was worth the money because from then on, it refused to run giving me error:<br />ERROR: 209<br />FingerPrint mismatch.<br />Please contact your vendor for assistance.<br /><br />Except with no instructions to how to contact your &#34;vendor&#34;.<br /><br />I believe that what I did to trigger this was to upgrade to Mavericks.  Just upgraded to Yosemite, and tried the software again, and still no dice.  When you pay the price this software is selling for, you certainly expect much more."
0,"Program does an OK job, but it's completely and utterly ridiculous that you don't get to simply buy it and own it--they force you to buy it again EVERY YEAR.  That's a rip-off, pure and simple."
1,"I switched from the OTHER brand to AVG when that brand couldn't remove a virus on my computer even with it's special removal tool. I had used this product for years and virus scans were done on a regular basis. AVG found and destroyed not only this virus but two others I didn't know I had. I had the same experience where I worked. My company was using the supposed 'industry standard' virus software and when an attack occurred that it couldn't handle McAffee got rid of it. AVG is less expensive and I think it does just as good a job. So it's AVG for me, no turning back."
0,Microsoft added additional charges before I could use it.  They wanted to add an additional charge for a second year of 360 professional.  I did not want the second year so that is why I bought word 2013.
1,Excellent program for non-professionals.
1,"Pretty good.  It is inexpensive so its pretty basic, but that is all I wanted."
1,"Very pleased, really cleaned up my computer and improved performance."
1,"Between the price of the product and the amount I get back on my taxes, this pays for itself several times over. Buying the downloadable version just made it even quicker to do my taxes..."
1,This product was downloaded very efficiently and met all expectations of what I wanted.  Well you want six more words huh?
0,"1, I wanted office  2010, not 2013. I have 2013 and it will  not work on thee church computers with media shout ver 4.2. Tried to cancel the order but to no avail"
1,Have used it for years and have been very satisfied . Very easy step by step instruction and very easy to go back and make changes if necessary. Don't know why they can't include a state e-file for the price which has went up every year that I have purchased.
1,Fun to work with... Now if building my dream home would be as easy!
0,"I did not like 2013 and I could not get it to work with my programs.  I had to uninstall it and download an older version of windows.  I did not get a refund on the 2013 purchase, but I understand the policy."
1,"I downloaded and tried Open Office, but I found it just kludgy enough to be uncomfortable. In addition, it saved files to unfamiliar formats, causing me to wonder whether other folks' MS office apps would have difficulty reading some of them. Finally, there's the fact that my life has been on Outlook for years. I uninstalled Open Office, downloaded MS Office Home and Business from Amazon, and lived happily ever after. (So far.)"
0,"Subpar, very dated and hard to get a handle on. Much better out there for free."
0,doesnt work on mac
0,Sorry to see an old friend go!  I have used TurboTax since college (that's a long time!)<br />I can't describe my dissatisfaction as eloquently as the &#34;1&#34; scores above.<br />Sorry TurboTax but I just bought my copy of HRBlock.  I will give that a try this year.  It will be a little extra work and require getting used to a different software.  But only if I come out bleeding will I buy TurboTax.
1,got this a long time ago to save money and keep my Garmin updated... Well worth the price and never a problem with the codes.
1,Haven't had a problem since I got it so it seems to be doing its job.
0,"The service and pricing options are amongst the best out there, I was ready to purchase but unfortunately the desktop application does not have any sort of sync functionality, I do not have the time to do this manually every time I change something."
1,I tried both Turbo tax and At home and with At home it gave me a bigger refund. The wizard was better and easier to navigate. Would recommend it.
0,This product does not even deserve a single star. Instead of simplifying taking care of your finances it turns into a part time job. It is full of bugs and good luck successfully downloading your transactions.
1,I really enjoyed this product because this one helped my computer. Thank you you all again have a blessed day.
1,never been audited since I started using TurboTax.
1,"Protects you against those viruses that will take over your computer!<br /><br />I notice Norton customers complaining about still getting infected. Norton is an Anti-Virus, There is still another virus called 'Malware' which Norton does not protect you from, You'll want to get MalwareBytes.  Norton + Malwarebytes works very well together!"
0,I just installed this and now my computer won't allow me to browse the internet. There all sorts of Mcafe programs running in the background and my computer worked fine before. Now it is slow and won't work. This is terrible! I read reviews after the fact and many people apparently have this same problem. I am so upset and have no clue how to fix this!  Update: I uninstalled this program and everything runs perfect.  It literally broke my computer and now I can't get a refund!  I never write bad reviews but seriously this is a SCAM
1,So easy to use and bug free.  I've used Turbotax the last several years and have not had any issues.  I generally wait until mid-March to download it.  Most bugs have been worked out by that point.
1,"I tried to work without Office but let's face it: This is still the only software of its kind worth having. Now before the critics go off and point out all of the wonderful free alternative, let me assure you I have tried them. Google docs, Apple Pages for Mac, even OpenOffice.org. They just don't do it well enough to compete. Also, as the de facto standard for professional writing, number crunching and connection bunching, you sorta gotta go along with the business crowd, they get so judgie when you don't."
1,Works like a charm.
1,"I've used TT for many years.  It starts with last year's file so I do not have to re-enter that info.  But I wish it had a tax-planning tool.  Instead, I make a &#34;dummy&#34; return with estimates of next-year's tax info."
1,"Fun to use.  There is a learning curve for the beginner, but once you get into it it is fun."
1,"This is the second yr of purchasing this product. I love it!! It is easy. Had problems at first, but that was on me. Not the smartest person whe it comes to computers and I figured it out. Would recommend this product to everyone!"
1,"[This is written by her husband who uses Sherry's amazon account to order lotsa stuff.]  For centuries I used IE.  Then came Chrome.  Chrome plugged up my XP and my wife's Vista.  Get rid of Chrome.  Replace with Firefox.  Love it!  Had it for several years and then got Windows 8.1.  Used all three of the mentioned browsers a number of times; now my default browser is Firefox.  I just like the way it works.  And one thing that is a bonus is that there is an add-on called FEBE.  It is software that backups your extensions.  Didn't know how it would work when I changed computers, but I saved the FEBE backup on a thumb drive and transferred it to my new computer.  I was able to import some of the info into both IE and Chrome.  But, when I downloaded firefox and fired it up for the first time, it was as if I had never left it; it found the backup and automatically installed it.  So, actually 6 stars for both Firefox and FEBE."
0,"As always, Amazon is wonderful so if you want to subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud - ONLY do it via Amazon - You DO NOT want to go through Adobe directly as they will NOT cancel your subscription. Here are the details: I created 2 subscriptions last week: one for a PC using Amazon , the other on a MACbook going through Adobe Creative Cloud directly. I did not like the publishing to the iPad via Macbook so decided to cancel my subscription . Because I had subscribed directly with Adobe, I could not cancel even though I was only active 1 week (and the policy was for full refund within one month cancellation). So I had to cancel my credit card. Also, the whole interaction with Adobe Customer Service was via chat session only (I had saved the chat session and it turns out that this is the only proof I had that Adobe would cancel this subscription). However, they did not send email confirmation, they turned off my Adobe account immediately , and they did not post the return to my credit card. So, I had to cancel my credit card to stop them from further posting to my credit card.<br /><br />Now for part B: Because of this whole problem with Adobe, I cancelled the PC-version of the Adobe Creative Cloud. This was much better handled ONLY BECAUSE I had processed the subscription via AMAZON -- not ADOBE directly. At this point, I do not intend to ever do another software subscription -- at least not with Adobe Creative Cloud.<br /><br />I hope this helps others."
1,Upgraded to pro so that I could have the Windows Media Center for TV recording and watching.  Upgrade went fine and license code is sent by email within an hour.
1,I am a long time user or Symantec/Norton Security products.  They are reliable and easy to install and give me a sense of confidence as I visit any web sites I need.
0,i wish i never got this program.  Takes to long to down load then it didn't work.  I hope I can cancell this.
0,"I have been a Quicken user since the early version 3.0 days. Navigation is an issue to retrain oneself on how to get basic things done. Transfering funds between accounts, not the accounts at an institution but the accounts you set up within Quicken, never found the method as used in previous versions. Setting up loan accounts and refinancing accounts is still a mystery in this new version. What Quicken needs to do is NOT assume they are the sole financial institutions for Quicken users. Most any use or navigation help question I have is based on Quicken being the bank. For me and probably to the majority of users, Quicken is used as a tool to record and track finances NOT to do financial transactions. I'd rather go back to the 2011 version because Quicken no longer suits my needs. I doubt I will buy Quicken again.[[ASIN:B008S0IMCC Quicken Deluxe 2013 [Download]]]"
0,It was my first time using turbo tax. My taxes are simple but it still made errors in the HSA contribution/credit calculation that was a pain. I'll go back to TaxCut next year. the Vendor was fine.
0,"Truly awful!  What started as a decent and relatively effective free antivirus has gotten progressively more bloated with crap few people want or need...  Worse yet, they are fast becoming one of the most invasive leaky programs out there!  Even with the free version you can expect them to bundle junk like \\""Browser Protection\\"" and \\""Browser Cleanup\\"" which often do more bad than good, \\""Secure Line\\"" (totally unneccessary), as well as the annoying \\""Avast Gadget\\"" which most experienced users immediately remove - after it gets installed WITHOUT your consent! (as do several of these other pieces of junkware)...  Simply Google \\""Avast Gadget\\"" to see how many people ask how to get rid of it!  Equally annoying is their \\""Grime Fighter\\"" which is loaded into your updated program without your consent, convinces newbies that their pc is filled with problems, and then asks for payment to remove it!...  Very sad to see the downward slide of what was once a nice lean Antivirus program...  I guess Greed Conquers All!  (but it is indeed foolish greed - since you will find your customer base and profits shrinking over time, Avast!)  I predict the death knell will be dealt to these people as soon as another (wiser and perhaps somewhat less greedy!) group introduces a simple and functional alternative!  --IMPORTANT!!! - BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN INSTALLING - DO NOT JUST CLICK \\""OK\\"" OR \\""NEXT\\"", ETC. UNTIL YOU EXAMINE WHAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING - THESE SLEAZEBALLS WILL TRY TO CHANGE YOUR HOMEPAGE, SEARCH PROVIDER, OR SUBSCRIBE YOU TO SOME CRAPWARE NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT!!!  BaSically you just need to un-check any check boxes during the install process - and don't agree to participate in the \\""Avast Community\\"" - as it is, they collect information on you without informed consent, so be sure to use a bogus name when renewing their free \\""license\\""...  Too bad AVG has become just about as bad - use either of these with caution, and go thru every single setting - google any options you are not sure about, and if you end up with junk like \\""AVAST GADGET\\"" or \\""remote assistance\\"", \\""Browser Cleanup\\"" (you can do this on your own, just google it for instructions), or their horrid \\""Grime Fighter\\"" scam, just go to control panel / programs and features / select AVAST, then \\""Change\\"", and then uncheck the undesired garbage features... You'll probably want all of the shields, but as for \\""components\\"", I use only the \\""software updater\\"" - be sure to google any other ones to see if you need them (unlikely!)...  GOOD LUCK!    ###Update: It appears that this latest free version is quite different from the recent free one I installed a couple months ago - BEWARE!  See if a friend saved their free download (Always choose \\""save\\"" and retain the download in case a later version lets you down like this one apparently will!)... If you can get a slightly older free copy, install it with care - remember, these people aren't trustworthy and will try to load their junk as well!) - Above all else, NEVER, EVER CALL AVAST FOR ASSISTANCE - the only purpose their \\""customer assistance\\"" dep't serves is to try and scam you into buying more crap from them!... If you develop a problem, turn to Google and search for a description of the trouble to find help - so many people run into trouble, there are TONS of sources for free self-help!"
0,"I have been an avid Quicken user since October of 1992. I do not think I've ever had an upgrade Quicken program with as many bugs in it as this one. My last version was Q H&B 2012 and I'm beginning to wish I had kept that. It seems like every day some new bug seems to show up. Today , I could not get the programs built in calculator to pop up on the screen. I'm having an issue trying to run reports also. I have contacted support on a couple of the issues to no avail. I'm thinking of uninstalling and going back to 2012."
1,Been very happy with this software. I've been using it for a few years after having problems with TurboTax. I find it to be easy to use and have not had any problems. I highly recommend this Block software.
0,"In all fairness, it's not Amazon's fault, but this newest version of Quicken needs to be recalled and customers need to be refunded. I have been a Quicken user since MS-DOS versions on 360k floppy discs so I know this software. I was upgrading every other year but this time, I wish I hadn't. Too many issues to list, but in a nutshell, save your money."
0,"Very buggy for me. First I had a reconciliation tell me it was $1000s of dollars off, where the reconciliation screen did not match the online balances showing in its register. Now I have accounts showing negative balances on account view, while register shows a totally different amount. They are doing a patch update now saying the old version had an issue, but I think that is BS answer. I followed all upgrade instructions. Right now, the information is unreliable and useless for me to manage balances and bill pays... which is the main purpose of the software.<br />Between the TurboTax debacle this year and this crappy upgrade, Intuit is doing way downhill lately. I wish there were decent alternatives like we have on TurboTax. I would dump Intuit in a heartbeat."
1,What I like about Norton Antivirus is two-fold.  One - security suites (in my experience) suck.  They slow your computer down and I have never had good things happen to me from using them.  Using a combination of Windows firewall and Norton Antivirus just seems to work great.  The antivirus by itself leaves a small footprint and doesn't bog your computer down at all.  Worth the money at a nice price.
0,"I'm a young attorney running a small practice with a partner.  I consider myself fairly technologically adept and this is by far the most frustrating piece of software I've ever encountered.  I've been using Quickbooks 2009/2010 for just over a year and I have had to contact customer services nearly a half dozen times, for issues relating to license verification or otherwise being locked out of the software.    Once you're in the program, the software is counter-intuitive and requires you sit through several tutorials before you're ready to start invoicing clients.  If you buy this product, get ready to bookmark dozens of online forums for technical support or pay Intuit's extortionist rates for customer service.  Once you learn your way around, you discover very interesting customization options, all of which you must pay additional fees to acquire (you can't even print checks with paying a fee!). I'm thoroughly convinced the software is just a portal designed to increase Intuit's customer support and customization revenues. I've discovered other options tailored specifically for attorneys, all of which INCLUDE customer support in the purchase price and seem much more intuitive and easy to use.    The only positive thing I have to say is that I purchased QB 2009 in the summer of 2009 and was allowed to \\""upgrade\\"" to the 2010 version for about $30."
1,"Every time there is an office upgrade I cringe. But this version of Office is a lot like the 2007 version, at least in regard to the features I use the most. So there wasn't a whole lot of stuff to relearn. That makes me smile. Downloading the product was easy and there were no glitches. Paint me a happy customer."
1,"Had so many problems with Norton Internet Security crashing my old PC and new laptop I decided to try this software. While more expensive, I have had no crashes, no viruses, no security issues. Software runs and updates behind the scenes and does not slow down my laptop's performance at all, even when doing a full scan. Definitely recommend this product."
0,"This review refers to the download product - TurboTax Business Federal + E-file 2011[Download].  I cannot yet comment on the software itself, although in year's past I've been generally satisfied.  My only disappointment with the program, based on previous year's experiences, is that Intuit hits you for an additional fee ($30, roughly) for the state program and efile.  Now, as for this year's version - DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  At least, not until the downloader error is fixed.  I downloaded this program this morning, and after installation I went ahead and opened the program.  Everything was working smoothly to this point.  However, TurboTax Business 2011 did not open.  NO!  Rather, TurboTax Deluxe 2011 opened.  Now, I had previously purchased and installed TurboTax Deluxe 2011, so I figured maybe the desktop icon was in error.  NO!  Turns out, another copy of TurboTax Deluxe 2011 was indeed installed, and registered.  Well, hmmm.... no big deal, I suppose, except any attempts to access TT Deluxe personal tax returns, or attempts at again installing TurboTax Business 2011, resulted in errors, errors and more errors!  Finally, I had to return to a prior Windows Restore point, uninstall all copies of alleged \\""TurboTax Business 2011\\"" and my actual TurboTax Deluxe 2011, delete stray files, reinstall fonts (Arial and Verdana), then reinstall TurboTax Deluxe 2011.  Thankfully, I had backed up the personal tax returns so I had uncorrupted data files readily available after all this tomfoolery.  Sadly, I have a day set aside today to work on my taxes, but no TurboTax Business 2011 to work on them with.  The downloader is clearly defective. (Yes, I tried downloading again, and same garbage resulted.)  I don't know whether fault lies with Amazon or Intuit, but this is clearly horrid quality control.  To receive a program other than the one purchased, AND have it corrupt other installed programs and data files, is not acceptable."
0,"Since x5 was introduced, there have been many complaints (including the x5 forum) about the screen capture, and the tech support people are clueless (I have been exchanging emails with them for several days, and still no solution, but some people have waited for a solution for about 6 months).<br />On many PCs the x5 screen capture does not detect the audio system - this is the case with my laptop bought earlier this year, and, no matter what is tried, x5 will not detect the audio system. On my desktop, X5 detects the system audio but does not record the audio, and does not detect the microphone either (error message: \\""Start Audio volume Test Failed #29\\""). Both PCs have Windows 7. (X5 screen capture does not work with XP.)<br />Also, the screen capture freezes if I try to switch between the system audio and microphone.<br />For some PCs, the screen capture may work, but for too many, it doesn't.<br /><br />Update: I tried the software on a third PC (Windows 7), and again the audio system was not detected. After x5 was released (some six months ago) many people complained (about the audio system not being detected) to Microsoft, which issued a verification procedure (a recording device has to be enabled and set as default) - in some cases that may be the solution.<br />In conclusion, I tried the software on three PCs: on two of them the audio system was not detected no matter what; on the third one, the audio system was detected, but X5 would not record the audio - on this one, the microphone was not detected either."
1,I have been using TurboTax for at leas two decades and still find it a great tool for simplifying the tax return chore each year. The software is very intuitive to use with its &#34;interview style&#34; for gathering relevant data. I only wish INTUIT would offer marginal upgrades at a lower price each year to update the tax code which has changed rather than make you buy the same product over and over and over again.
1,"If you really want your little ones to learn to type, this is for you. Both of my children were over 45 WPM within the first 6-8 months and are now over 75 WPM. One of the best purchases I have made for them !"
1,Easy to use! Awesome price! Been using it for years
1,As always the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 has met my expectations in a big way. Thank you so much.
1,"I'm new to digital art so this my first time buying or using this kind of program but it was easy enough to learn at least the basics of this program, everything is laid out and organized well, the brushes are very good (i like how i'm able to switch back and forth between the older brushes and the newer brushes) but it would be nice if the program came with just a few more. Being able to place my most used brushes into a separate category so i can access it quickly is helpful too.  I love how there is a box for a reference image and you even take certain colors from the image and apply them to your own work. Also, Corel X3 runs very fast and is super smooth, I never have issues with performance."
1,"Happy with purchase, although you will need to see the online tutorials to really use this software if you haven't before."
1,"I have been using this program forever and never had a problem when transferring from one year to another.  This time the program transferred over a couple of investments that had been closed, but they came over with money in them. It took some time to go to each investment site to assure that all other investments had been transferred over correctly. It is still a good program and I am pleased with it."
1,Love psp
1,"We get this every year to do our partnership taxes. It is so far the best program we've found, very user friendly."
1,I've been using Norton forever and never had a problem. I had to renew my subscription and got it for a great price.
0,"I used to love avast, it was my favorite virus protection, and no doubt still protects me just as well, but these popups are litterally in the corner of my bloody screen all day. I don't need avast to clean my computer, I have programs to do that. I will update my software when I need to. The worst part is I can't turn them off. I have them set to be quick, but they never go away anyway, I can't even read part of what I'm typing because there is a popup in the corner of my screen."
1,Great product. What I expected and a little more.
0,Software works ok but cant update it.It keeps telling the regerstrasion is piraited.Also not the greatest features ether.Wondershare had no answer to my problem.
0,"I found the program to be somewhat dated, technology wise, not easy to resume where you left off without repeating a lot of previous content"
1,"Again, year after year, a great product.  In the years past I have never had any difficulties with incoming malware, etc.  This past few months it seems there have been 'clever' hackers at work - and some have made it through this sophisticated defense system.  I now believe the current hackers that have gotten very busy and done their homework well.<br /><br />The fault is not necessarily Kasperskys - but it is beginning to create a doubt, \\""can KIS2015 keep up with the latest breed of extraneous malware?\\""<br /><br />Nevertheless I am still convinced this is the best product on the market, and will continue using it.  Wait until next year when I go to renew this version.  I'll reevaluate, then make sure to tell you what I think!"
1,"I won't be able to use the software until at least January 8th as that is the expected date that the product will be updated for use.  I have used H&R Block software for several years.  The product does everything that I need it to do and much more.  I have been doing my own taxes for over sixty years but using this product I would be able to complete and file my taxes using H&R Block even if I had no previous experience at completing a return.  The software will walk you through the process step by step.  Even if you are stumped you can get a solution within the software.  I am already sold on using H&R Block software so the fact that I can purchase the product from Amazon and download it instantly along with getting the product at a very good price is frosting on the cake.  Buy it, try it, like it."
1,Being able to download the software was very convenient and efficient.  The price was also better than any I found in local stores and discount warehouses.  Very pleased.
1,"A few clicks and 10 minutes of updates and form downloads and my TurboTax download was ready to rock. I squared off with Uncle Sam, hoping to recoup a big wad of my hard earned income. I like TurboTax's step by step format: hard to go wrong or forget something. But it's faster to skip to the sections you need to complete if you know what you're doing. TurboTax imported information from the previous year but first made me dig through nested folders to select the 2012 data file. Why? After all, I placed them in the same folder! In prior years TurboTax managed to find the file on its own within a second or two.<br /><br />I'm fairly organized during the tax year and used Quicken to create a categorized report of my tax and business related expenses. I've had problems importing tax categories directly from Quicken in the past, so I manually entered the summed expenses. Most of my income comes from a salary position but I also operate a full time family business, have assorted investments and somehow managed significant gambling winnings. So, yeah, I made extensive use of Schedule C. No problem, it's all there in TurboTax Deluxe albeit without the extra \\""advice\\"" of the \\""Home & Business\\"" version. I paid extra for \\""Home & Business\\"" a few years back and found it a poor investment. The bare bones Schedule C is fine for a small business, especially if you're been doing your taxes for years.<br /><br />I'd rate doing both Federal and state taxes as smoothing sailing with only a few minor confusing gotchas. The error checks were helpful and actually flagged a couple minor omissions. Finally, I exported all tax forms to PDF and saved them on my hard drive for future reference. After giving the PDF forms a look through I felt confident all was in order, so I input my ID number and clicked send. Federal E-filing was fast and easy, and the filing fee was included in the cost of the product. Realize they charge you to E-file your state taxes so have your credit card ready unless plan on using snail mail. The scary sales pitch for audit insurance seemed a bit pushy and cheap. And, yep, my tax refunds were in my accounts within 5 (Fed) to 10 days (state). So I'll be buying some new toys and helping keep Amazon fat!n on using snail mail. The scary sales pitch for audit insurance seemed a bit pushy and cheap. And, yep, my tax refunds were in my accounts within 5 (Fed) to 10 days (state). So I'll be buying some new toys and helping keep Amazon fat!"
0,"This is crap. Don't buy the download, because then you'll be screwed for a return like I am. Hate this program"
0,"Do NOT be deceived. This is NOT a new product. It literally just installs Microsoft for Office 2011 Mac in the Mac version. NO DIFFERENCE. If you already have that license, just stick with it and continue to update until they come out with an actual upgrade, THEN start your annual subscription with an actual new product."
1,"As long as you don't have a home business, this product is fine & will meet your needs as it always did."
1,I like it better then MacAfee. Simipler to use. Will never go back. Even cheaper too. Easy to download and install.
1,"Nice, I have avast on my phone, tablet and laptop. Fits my need. Recommended"
0,"This didn't work for me, got a virus a few days after I installed this that it didn't pick up. I uninstalled and purchased another product."
0,"This is the second year I've used the HR software instead of TurboTax, as it was much cheaper. Everything worked fine except for the accuracy check which provided obscure and confusing information that I was supposed to address  before it would let me take the next steps. I've worked professionally in tax and law, and I found it hard to work with in this regard. I wouldn't recommend it for the average person because of this, which is too bad because the rest of the software was fine.  I don't know if TurboTax is any better, but if I were doing it over I'd probably pay the extra for that product."
1,I got exactly what I paid for...
1,Thanks
1,"User friendly, efficient, thorough."
1,"Have used this product for years, it's great."
0,"I did an upgrade from Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 to version 12.  There are difference.  I don't like all of them.  One feature I used quite a bit in version 10 was the ability to make fine adjustments in color balance of my images.  That has disappeared from version 12.  Or, at least, if it is still there I have not found it.  All in all....I wish I had saved my money.  Another feature I can no longer find is the ability to select the color management profile I want to use.  Again....perhaps it is still there and I have just not found it's new location.  These software companies love to move things around for no apparent reason."
0,The autotag function did not work well<br />I used winamp free version that was way better<br />Not worth the money
1,Works great! Much easier to use than older versions
0,This did not work
1,Excellent product.  Using since last 5 year's.<br />No issues so far.
1,"Being in charge of the books is an intimidating task in any business or organization but with Quickbooks anyone can do it.  Quickbooks gives you all the tools necessary to organize your business with everything you need right at your fingertips to run the day to day operations.  The thought of having to come up with a management system to take care of all that Quickbooks does in our organization, well it would be overwhelming."
1,"I love the new look - definitely mac users got some much needed attention with this latest version.  The appearance is much more pleasing to the eye although the functionality seems to be about the same as the previous version(s).  I am disappointed in the mobile versions, both iPad and iPhone - they are very hard to navigate and really not worth the time to download them."
1,Absolutely flawless!  Best tax package I've ever used.
1,"So far this product has been great, no complaints."
1,HR Block has been my choice since 97. I have tried other products and none seems to be a better product for the price.
1,easy to navigate and use
1,We recently renewed our PC Matic for year 2. Love the product. Have had no issues with our computer. Would recommend this to friends and family.
1,"I have used Quicken for years, I would tell you how long, but I would date myself.  I have worked with PC's for a long time but have been using a Mac for several years.  Quicken Essentials didn't do it for me (or anybody else) and I loaded a VMWare partition on my Mac so I could use Quicken.  After having many issues with Quicken, I decided to look for an alternative and found iBank5.  You can load a 30 day pilot version and convert easily from Quicken, conversion is quite easy.  I have had a few issues and have gone to their online chat which is wonderful for support.  I'm surprised that more people have not given iBank 5 a better review.  It integrates seamlessly with Mac giving you tasks for upcoming transactions, etc.,  There are some things I don't understand yet, but that will come in time.  I would have given it 5 stars, but that may be from things that I just don't know.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this product."
0,"If you own and Mac and are looking for a reputable 3rd party company for a blu ray player, these aren't the guys for you!  Stay away!  The software doesn't read blu ray discs on my MAC.  I continue to get file load errors on more than one disc.  I have sent Aiseesoft multiple emails for support and have been waiting over three days for a response.  There isn't a phone number or contact number on their website to call if you need support.  Purchase at your own risk!  I would recommend another 3rd party software to run blu ray with Mac."
1,"Exactly what you've come to expect from Turbo Tax.  Yes, some of the interface for the 'interview' portion has changed, but it's still just your taxes.  Turbo tax covers all the bases and gets it done."
1,"This is my second year of using Norton.  I have been very pleased with the product.  We run it on 3 computers and have had no computer issues to deal with.  We did replace a computer last year (it was old).  My only improvement on this product would be that if one replaces a computer, they could reinstall Norton and utilize the remaining coverage.  This should be included in the purchase price, not as an additional fee."
1,Webroot ordered today was supposed to be for fifteen months but renewed for only one year.Please advise how to correct
1,superb
0,"I have been using Turbo tax for about 4 years now, and usually everything goes well.  I have also been using It's Deductible (Turbo Tax's online charitable contribution record keeping system).  This year, when I tried to log in from within the Turbo Tax application, it would not accept my username.  I went to the actual It's Deductible website, and the same credentials worked fine.  But here's the kicker: ALL my contributions from 2011 were erased!  And all but one contribution from 2010 was also gone.  Where did all my records go?  It worked so well last year, but was a dismal failure this year.  Also, I was hit with ads inside the turbo tax software two different times while preparing my taxes.  I paid $40 (plus $20 for state e-filing), and I certainly should not have to click past turbo tax credit card ads inside the software.  It's just a shame, because I don't remember that last year?  Other than that, as usual, I love the interface, and the flow of the program is intuitive."
1,"I have used this software for at least 5 or 6 years.  I love it!  It has greatly improved over the years and it is by far the best recipe software I have ever used.  It is not without issues of course, BUT their customer service is awesome!  I have had several (not many by any means) small issues with the software not opening properly, etc. and each time I have written their tech support I have received a prompt, courteous, free easy fix for my issues.  They go out of their way to make sure that you are up and running as quickly as possible.  Remember, people that are unhappy usually write reviews much quicker than someone who is happy from my experience.  Try it for yourself and I can promise you that you will be really happy with your purchase."
0,"Counter-intuitive. Can not load .MOV files, but does not tell you why. Three hours and could not even get started. Of course, you can not return it and there is no way to test it before buying. Bordering on fraud!"
1,"Love it, Works better than my 2009 Version as it allows me to keep track with my iPhone & iPad."
1,"For whatever reason, I keep coming back to Norton year after year for my business computer use after always researching other brands.  I really like this new combined version.  The interface is very simple.  The scans are fast.  It does not seem to use much resources at all either.  I liked that I could buy a cheaper one license version, as I only need it on my PC at work.  I have never gotten a virus with Norton.  I also use a free manual anti-malware product and Norton Security's firewall will allow it to run its scans without problems.  Very pleased with this purchase."
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for about 12 years now, and it seems to get easier every year.<br />I did find a calculation error on one of my worksheets, but the override function on TUrbo Tax helps easily correct this.<br />I suggest that if you are going to use this program, be sure to take the time to check the worksheets for accuracy.<br />The worksheets are very easy to follow. Their tax expert staff online are very experienced and of much help when help is needed.  You may have to wait a good amount of time before you actually are connected with an agent, but the wait is worth it.  When I went to chat with an expert yesterday, I was 265 in the queue, and only had to wait about 30 minutes before I had an agent online.  And they do give you a &#34;count down&#34; every few minutes to show you the progress in the queue.<br />Overall I am very pleased with this program.  I had tried a few more previously, and once I went to Turbo Tax I never went back."
0,"With each annual update to Street Atlas USA they make it more and more complicated. Thus, making it more and more user UNFRIENDLY."
1,"Introduction:<br /><br />This is a powerful package of software that allows you to compose music, arrange or remix songs, or make background music for your home videos, shows, or other uses (barring license restrictions) I found it doesn't have  a really steep learning curve -- within about a half an hour after installation, I had \\""composed\\"" a percussion and synthesizer piece for some videos of paintings that I had put together earlier. As with many kinds of software, there are two learning curves; a shallow one to get started satisfactorily, and a second one, to get deeper into the refinements that takes a lot longer.<br /><br />The MX basic package differs from the Premium package that is available at a higher price, in that there are more sounds & loops, more genres (including a film music genre) more templates, a better mastering suite.  In addition, you get an analog compressor and synthesizer, a copy of Music Editor 3 that can be used to edit samples, and the ability to mix tracks in 5.1 Surround Sound, again something that makes this version more appealing to amateur film makers. If you are serious about film music, I'd suggest the premium package, but for most people mixing their own house music, the MX regular package is sufficient. You can upgrade, add loops, styles, and much more from the Magix site or from \\""Catooh\\"" which is the German website where the software originated.<br /><br />The styles include hip-hop, ambient, chill, techno trance, electro pop, minimal \\""tech house\\"". You can add other styles (called \\""soundpools\\"" that include percussion, vocals, instrument loops, drums, bass all tempo and key related) by purchasing packages from Magix.<br /><br />Installation:<br /><br />This is a download version; I downloaded directly from Amazon, using our FIOS internet service. It took about 20 minutes to get the software downloaded, another 40 minutes or so to install an upgrade plus a number of sound loops and extras that come with the package. The installation went smoothly, if lengthily. You can download the software again, from your Amazon digital storage, if you need to restore it after a computer crash. You can download three times using one license key; after that, you need to correspond with Magix.<br /><br />If you are not certain you will like Magix, you can download a trial version that is usable for 30 days.<br /><br />Using the Software:<br /><br />I was able to compose, using pre-set loops, a very nice ambient percussion, vocal and synthesizer work with a repeating loop for part that is suitable for a home slide show. It took me a half an hour to get a pretty decent composition that would work for my video slide show.<br /><br />I was also able to hook up an old MIDI capable Yamaha keyboard (a 15 yr old one) and use a new MIDI/USB cable and use the keyboard, loading in synthesizer instruments and play them on the keyboard rather than use the virtual keyboard in the software (I play piano, so I prefer a live keyboard.) That only took a bit longer.<br /><br />The steep part of the curve is learning advanced mixing, equalizing and tweaking the sound using the editing portion as well as being able to understand wave forms to customize synthesizer sounds. Since I don't know much about sound and recording, I'm at a disadvantage. There is a lot of power, but I would need many tutorials to get to the point where I can optimize my music using all the features.<br /><br />There are also video special effects and feature--presumably to sync music to your video work; have not tried it yet.<br /><br />Reports are that version 18 (this one) is buggy, but I found it was rather smooth and if you are patient and do not try to hurry the process, the uptime seems acceptable. I crashed it once or twice in a few hours of use, which I consider average. (I've had much worse experience with some film-editing packages.)<br /><br />There are some tutorials and demos. I didn't find them particularly excellent. You may find better ones on Youtube if you do a search. Also, there are some weird glitches in loading new loops and styles--I found some tips on the internet about how to rename the new loops to import them into the software but it wasn't info I found in the Help documentation and by the way, the organization of the software isn't entirely intuitive.<br /><br />Since you can upload your songs directly to almost any social network such as Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, there is an issue of royalty and copyrights. You can't publish videos to public sites that contain music you don't have the rights to use. You can however, use the compositions you make with Magix privately, although you can't sell any of the songs you may compose using the pre-composed elements in this software. (It's possible to buy some licensing rights on the Catooh website.) In any case, for most home use, the software will let you make movie music for your wedding video, stirring drum background for sports, or fun stuff for slide shows and any other multimedia ideas you may have.<br /><br />But if you compose house music for sale or public use, there is a licensing issue; however, you can purchase licenses of various sorts from Catooh if you want to incorporate their loops into your music.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />MORE FUN than you can imagine.<br /><br />This is a very powerful music arranging and composing software, suited for home use due to licensing issues.

1,as usual good  software...
1,This was a breeze to install and time will tell how good it is at detecting viruses and fixing computer issues.
1,"I have used PC Matic for each of my four computers for the past year.  I recently received an offer to renew my subscription, and I did so without any hesitation.  PC Matic has performed flawlessly and kept each of my computers running perfectly.  I would recommend this product without hesitation to anyone seeking virus protection and performance enhancement for their PCs."
0,"over a month since purchase, unable to use sense download. useless. I,ve had this program 4 years.<br />this is a disaster."
0,"Don't know what the purpose is if you're already using &#34;Find my iPhone&#34; on iPhone.  Seems like a waste of money, but I was required to purchase it due to industry I work in.  Maybe someone can tell me how it gives me more than &#34;Find my iPhone?&#34;"
0,"I truly believe that what they do is grab one marginal new feature such as free credit score and package it with the latest set of bug fixes and call it a paid upgrade. It's truly shameful, especially to users like myself that continue to buy it year after year. Most of the time when I review products I think the 1-star reviews are outlier bad experiences, but with Quicken, this is my third year in a row of a terrible experience.<br /><br />Here's the way it went:<br /><br />Day one:<br />Back up everything, twice, just to be sure. Make sure Qucken 2014 installer is still around. Even though they say you won't lose your data, there is so much else that could go wrong.<br />Download the update, count to 10, then install it.<br />Hey, it installed seamlessly and quickly!<br />It seems to start up faster!<br />Everything seems to work. Shortcuts may have even been fixed.<br />Hey, I can now enter a number in my pay check (split), get the error that stuff doesn't add up, and it will actually bring up the right transaction! It used to bring up the next one in the list. Seriously, developers?<br />Accounts seem to update. Well, ok!<br /><br />Day two:<br />Oh, no, the password vault no longer works!<br />Try again, reset the password, try again, research. Oh, no others, are seeing this!<br />Log in to a different account. After the second try of this, I'm in again. But now, every time I'm asked for the vault password, I worry it's not going to work again.<br />Keyboard shortcuts aren't fixed! I still have to click on the frickin' title bar first. Come on!<br />The budget is still slow, clunky and has a mind of its own. It likes to auto-scroll all the way to the left even though you've selected a cell and started using the keyboard to scroll. I never understood the concept of the separation of mouse and keyboard cursors.<br />The credit score feature seems to work, but there is no way it could be correct.

1,"PC Matic has done everything it has claimed it would do. It has caught viruses and removed,updated drivers and registry keys. So simple to use."
1,I have been using Avast for many years.  I use it on several devices and I have always been pleased.
1,Works great on mac looks great to
0,"Pay for a better product........Although this one is free, I cannot rate it on that basis alone. I still had problems with my computer until I purchased the online code though Amazon for McAfee."
1,I feel very safe using Norton for my online computer safety coverage because I have never had any kind of interference from outside predators. I can set up my preferences and the timing and feel confident that my computer and  my personal information are safe. Also I don't have to be bothered by annoying pop ups. My computer has never crashed or had a virus so I attribute this to the power of Norton. Thanks so much for great service and reliability
1,It has worked well for me.  Got a great price.
1,i have used norton since ive purchased this computer.i havent had any problems so therefor i figure that its doing its job. the price was right and the installation went smoothly. and during the year norton has updates for free.good all around deal.
1,Works for me.
0,"My old version was not compatible with the newer version of Windows, so this met my needs. If you plan to upgrade your computer (like I did) you will most likely need a newer version of Quicken, and this version worked for me."
1,I like Turbo Tax Basic for it serves my tax needs; and I purchase it every year.  I print and use the U.S. Postal Service to send in my completed tax forms.
1,I have used this product in the past and it has always worked as expected.  It makes tax preparation much easier.
1,"It is free and it works... what else do you want? Get it, you will not be disappointed. Get it on"
0,"Really poorly made. Does not support accounts in multiple currencies, if your bank isn't in the list then you can't import unless you use another version of quicken (or one of their products!), and is less functional than using an excel sheet."
1,"Taxes are so easy to me since I've discovered this program, why pay someone to do what I can do so easily?"
1,Easy to use and very cost effective.  I have used Turbo Tax in the past and always have been happy.
1,"I like the program in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and economy. A good option for starters who have a limited budget."
1,everything is spelled out and is user friendly There is even a few humorous parts. I was able to secure a great refund! Diane
1,You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the digital purchase does not go through the cart.  After phoning customer support I purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At payment time for the Quicken the total was reduced by the $35 bundle reduction.  So it did work :-)
1,"The proper version for my needs and the download was very straight forward. Despite the Turbo Tax  errors in the marketplace, this version meets my needs perfectly."
1,the item downloaded with no problem and i was relieved as i had problems years ago trying to download from norton to renew.  of course everything is better and easier now so i can't blame norton for it.  the price was good and cheaper than i  could go to the store and get it.  didn't take any longer than i thought it would.  very convenient and i didn't activate it until it was closer to the time i needed it.  i don't mind losing 2 weeks just in case there is a problem.<br />i would definately recommend it!!!!!
1,Price for the download was okay.<br /><br />Its like watch Dog.<br />Learn how to use and set function then you will enjoy it.
0,"They start out with one set of features.....you use it for a year, then they upgrade software &#34;free&#34; to you and boom, all those features are gone!"
1,"We had the free trial version which really seemed to work well.  It had been recommended by a computer tech.  Like the fact that it is a lifetime version.  So far, so good."
1,I use Quicken in order to keep my Bank Balance up to date and reconcile my accounts with the Bank
0,"This software is an expensive snare and delusion  The only reason this is getting 1 star is the helpfulness of customer service when the serial number didn't work. Otherwise I would give it none. Contrary to what was promised in the advertisment on the Toshiba website from which I bought it, it does not transfer all software---but you don't find that out until you have bought it and opened the box. It took me 2+ hours from when I first inserted the disk to the point where transfer could begin. That doesn't count the considerable time needed to get ‌the two computers in compliance with the conditions needed for transfer. After installing the software, I then found out that, in addition to not be able to download antispyware and antimalware as mentioned in the users guide, I could not transfer my camera, genealogy, or printer software. all very important to my computer activities. The transfer itself took 12 hours. When it was completed, I found that many of my personal preferences had not transferred. More important, almost none of my documents came over, and I have lost my mail program and all of my mail. (There was some warning about that before transfer, but it wasn't clear what would and wouldn't come over). In short, I am now going to have to manually reload and download much of my software, including the most important to me, manually reset most of my preferences, and manually transfer my documents. I will have to reset up a mail program. I may also have to totally reconstruct my genealogy. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid when I fell for the promises on the Toshiba website. It sounded too good to be true, and it was."
1,#pcmatic.com has sped up my computer and my wifes while protecting it as I use the web. It uses less resources and keeps me running. I am a happy camper.<br /><br />5 stars
1,Excelente. Gracias
0,"I was using Microsoft Money for years, and although it was quirky, changes in the screen behind it showing up through its windows, for instance, it worked well enough.  I had switched from an earlier version of Quicken to Money because Quicken was not very intuitive.  Ultimately, Microsoft abandoned Money, leaving its customer once again in a lurch, so I went back to Quicken.  The new version works better than the old Quicken, and closely enough to Money to not be a difficult transition.  Importing the data from Money took more data massaging than I had expected, with several transactions being dropped and/or duplicated; but I was done in one day, even with 20 years of financial history transferred.  Quicken does have quirks for me too.  It does not open to a file automatically, forcing me to make that selection each time; and there is an error each time I close the program.  I tried to find a solution online and it was suggested to reinstall the program; I may try that at some point, but the problems are not annoying enough for me to bother right now.  Also, the online linking to my accounts doesn't work either; whenever it try to log in I get a Quicken server error; so I just download the data from the websites manually and import it, which does work fine.  I am not one to spend hours with software support fixing others bugs if there is an acceptable work around.  Otherwise, as I said before, it works closely enough to Money for me to jump right in and get back to work.  I can't speak to things like budgeting and financial pictures or direct exporting to Turbo Tax, which I also use, because I never use them.  My main requirements are speed of data entry and I am happier with this new version of Quicken than I was with either the old Quicken or Money.  Reporting and searching also work to my satisfaction.  I don't have time right now to list all the other improvements I would like to see, but there are several."
0,"Overall, it ended up doing the job, but it wasn't all that easy.<br /><br />I had issues with importing information, issues when editing previously entered information, and of course the product is quite expensive.<br /><br />I was only filing a fairly simple s-corp. I wish there was an easier way to bundle this into a personal version (deluxe?) for less money, especially since TT Business does not feel remotely as polished as the personal versions.<br /><br />That said, there aren't many other options for doing it on your own but with &#34;guidance&#34;."
0,"Wish I could give it less than 1 star.  Quickbooks is the biggest ripoff company I have ever dealt with.  Unfortunately we started with it many years ago, all our business info is on it, so now we are stuck with it.  They force you to upgrade to newer versions or the payroll will no longer be supported, the yearly payroll service is UNBELIEVABLY overpriced, & if you ever need customer service, forget about it.  The phone wait is HOURS long, just to hear you don't have the right department.  They made an unauthorized charge to my credit card for a service I told them I no longer needed, & after another 2 hour wait on the phone to talk to someone about a refund, I finally received the refund, but for $35 LESS than the original charge!  Another 2 hour phone wait later to find out why, & I was told (after 3 or 4 long holds to talk to a supervisor) that my refund was pro-rated!!!!  So, they billed me for something I told them I no longer wanted, & I am charged $35 for the time it took them to fix their mistake!!!  Unbelievable!!  The product itself is fine, but their customer service is the WORST in the industry.  If you haven't started with them, do yourself a favor & go with another product."
1,Seems to work great.  Pop up information disappears too fast to read.
1,"easy to install, and it works quietly without needing a lot of attention. What more could I ask for?"
1,"Everything in Quickbooks 2014 is so much faster- getting things done, accessing reports, printing. Importing payroll in QuickBooks Mac 2014 is fast and simple- perfect for the small businessperson on the go."
1,"Licensing is an issue with corel. However, the software was bought at $20 bucks. I've had meals that costed more. This just works. However, if your drivers are not proper, you may have to hunt for something which is more current and updated. It is very sensitive about HDCP issues and Intel software... do not get me started about problems caused by Intel software."
1,"very easy to download and use, very easy format. It seems to be working just fine with my computer overall pretty happy with product."
1,Great program! I have had some issues but nothing major.
1,Turbo tax Delux is an awesome product. It made it incredibly easy to do my taxes.  It was great being able to download it straight from amazon.
1,great software
0,I used it to scan a drive and was unhappy to find that it couldn't identify any duplicates with the 1.5 Tb of data it searched.  I ended up using Araxis which found the duplicate files.
0,"I wish I had read some of the other reviews before I decided to buy.<br /><br />The software crashes and loses data.  Warning: Don't let this be your only source of your financial data!!  When it's gone, it's gone!<br />The link between the desktop and app aren't good and creates discrepancies.<br /><br />I also foolishly hoped this would tie into TurboTax in some way.  But that's a separate product for another $50!<br />Recommendation: switch back to a spreadsheet or get an accountant!!!"
1,"I never had an accounting class when I was in school, so when I started my own business, my accountant recommended QuickBooks Premier Edition.  With just a few pointers from my accountant, I now feel very confident that my accounting books will meet all of the requirements for keeping track of my engineering business.<br /><br />It also syncs with my Bank of America accounts which I check regularly,  It has everything I need to make sure the accounting side of my business.  Last week I sent out my first invoice.  It had all of the notes I made for the invoice.  It was also flexible enough for me to \\""design\\"" a unique invoice for my client.  The client required no other information for me to get paid.  This is a great feature."
0,You never are sure when you buy an item like this. Maybe it will work and maybe it won't. So far I haven't contracted any virus so.....<br />It eeems to be working as advertised. Ask me again in a year??
1,"It's great, so simple."
0,"Try finding any kind of contact information for Office 365 Home Premium tech support. ANY kind of contact info - phone number, email, web chat, smoke signal pattern - anything. Or even Microsoft instructions for how to unlock such a thing. I don't mean billing support or sales - actual *technical support*. You will not find it because it does not exist. And that's why you should not waste your money on this product. Just an old copy of Office on eBay."
0,is for a student.  My student was going away so I bought it and couldn't install it on her<br />computer.  Some wise acre person took my call at Amazon and couldn't care less.
0,"To be gouged you must at least have the software.  I've tried downloading to three different PCs, running two different OS/versions, and 3 browsers (Chrome, IE11, IE8, Firefox, all ending with a download error.  I've sent downloader logs to Amazon almost a week ago and haven't heard anything.  All this while I can successfully download prior years TurboTax from my Amazon software library.  This has been a completely unacceptable experience that I attribute to Amazon more than Intuit.  I'd either like my money back, or the media.  Then I can at least complain about being gouged.  To that point, I did seen an email offer for $25 from Intuit if This year's version isn't adequate compared to last year.  Yicht!"
1,"This is my second year doing taxes for my LLC.  Last year I used the H&R block version and was very disappointed with the experience.  TurboTax was much more user friendly and walked me through the entire process, H&R only displayed a form in some cases with no real help.  I highly recommend using TurboTax if you have a business and want to do the tax return yourself.  The only negative I saw were a couple of areas with limited info when you asked for help.  Google filled in the blanks in those cases, though."
1,"So far so good.  It has stopped several threats and runs smoothly in the background without interuption.  For something free, it seems to do really well."
0,"I purchased this software for the Rental Property portion.  Needless to say It was a complete waste of money.  I have used Quicken in the past but was not able to use the previous software on my new computer.  I updated and this version is AWFUL!.  I could not even enter a transaction with out it locking up and freezing my entire computer.  It is the least user friendly softer I have ever come across.  Do not purchase this, you will be disappointed. I will be contacting Amazon for a complete refund!"
1,I only use docs & spreadsheets but they work well with Word & Excels files.
1,"I had been debating updating my Quicken 2007 Basic to a newer version of Quicken, but had been hesitant because the reviews were not always fabulous.  But then my computer crashed & when I went to reinstall my 2007 Quicken, I found the disk had been scratched & wouldn't load, so I really no longer had a choice but to upgrade.  Now mind you, I have been a Quicken Basic user for years, and I am a really big fan, but I can't quite understand why people DON'T like this product.  If you have been a satisfied Quicken user, then I would HIGHLY recommend the upgrade.  It's not vastly different, but there are some obvious visual updates, which I personally like.  The biggest pro for me in this new software is when you first bring up Quicken, it will automatically bring up a transaction graph & breakdown of your spending for the last 30 days.  This graph has a drop options to change the time frame, accts, and spending vs. income.  The ONLY thing I don't like, is in the register, when you are clearing an item (I do it manually--just a personal preference of mine), you have to actually move the pointer around to click a specific circle rather than just click the box until a \\""c\\"" shows up, but that truly is just a minor issue.  I love this new software and would recommend to anyone getting started in organizing their personal finances, or if they just want a newer version of Quicken.  I'm still confused by the low customer ratings.  In my experience I don't find them justified."
0,"I'm always wary of getting a new version of software I am happy with.  But Quicken is a GREAT product, has been for me for at least a dozen years.......so I did it.  And I'm not happy with 2014.  However, Quicken support has been GREAT. A courteous, knowledgeable woman has already called me back about the issues and assured me they are being attended to.  And I feel confident it will fix the problems.  My issue is that I cannot download transactions, so basically it's completely non functional if I have no transactions to handle.  I'm waiting for the fix......."
1,"A long-time user of TurboTax,  I switched because TurboTax removed Schedules E and C.  HR still has them and it worked fine,<br />even importing data from last year's Turbo Tax files.  When you buy any tax software pay attention to all the costs:  up-front cost<br />for the software, plus additional charges possibly for state tax forms,  for e-submission of your US form, and for e-submission of<br />your state form.  You will want all four so find out what the last-second charges will be and add them up when comparing prices."
0,The package now charges you an additional fee of 40.00 to download the state edition. I found this to be quite irritating and the cost of this program is no longer a value and I will re-consider using this program in the future.
0,I purchased this product after experiencing difficulty with PowerPoint 2010's conversion feature.  Movavi's software didn't perform half as well as PowerPoint. Wasted money...
1,Excellent product.  Large improvement in the budget section.  This product provides all the tools to manage ones financials.....including investments.  Also being able to download the product from Amazon was a painless experience.  It works perfect.
0,This software is terrible. It doesn't download from any of my institutions except Capital One. The sync function doesn't work--the amounts don't match even immediately after a download. It is a total waste of money. I strongarmed into upgrading from Quicken Essentials because Intuit stopped supporting it and stopped allowing downloads. I severely regret this purchase.
1,so far so good we have had constant problems with our computer but as always amazon takes care of us. thanks so much again
1,"I had a lifetime subscription to another antivirus software. Apparently, that ended when they changed the program. I didn't press the issue. I downloaded Avast, last year. I am VERY PLEASED. It is as good as any software I have paid for. I would recommend Avast to ANYONE!!!"
1,was highly recommended by several &#34;people in the know&#34;<br /><br />pro:  easy to use<br /><br />con: too many pop-ups suggesting buying an upgrade.<br /><br />recommend? yes
0,It didn't do what customer service said it would.  Took forever to reach help.
1,Exactly as described
1,In short it's worth it's price. If u don't mind ur website being HTML then u r getting what u need.
0,It was upgrade windows 10. McAffee does not work with windows 10. my money lost. It cannot refund.
0,I will no longer use this product (after 12 years of using).  The reason being is the change that no longer allows you to report stock sales.  I've been preparing my 84 year old mothers returns year after year.  She lives primarily on Social Security and sells probably $5000 in ATT stock to supplement her income.  To do her taxes I would have to upgrade to the business version to report this small sale of stock.  HR Block will be the product I use going forward..
0,"This is the worst antivirus I have ever put on my laptop. This virus scan demolished my computer, tablet and phone. Once downloaded on my laptop, it automatically downloaded to my phone and tablet.  It slowed my phone and tablet. Not only that, I had to spend 100$ to get my laptop fixed. I would not recommend this crappy virus scan to anyone. It will destroy everything you have!!!!!"
1,I have used Tax Cut for many years and always thought TurboTax was over priced to do basically the same function.<br />(It's hard to give 5 stars for tax software when I personally feel we should not need to go through all of this convoluted effort to pay our taxes.)
0,"Do not buy this for young children!  The program allows students to move way too fast through the program and then they are too frustrated.  My daughter loved it the first two days.  She quickly exceeded the 5 WPM goal through the first part of the island.  Since then she has been in tears every time she uses the program because it is now too hard.  It has a feature that you can go back to previous lessons, but then you are repeating same exact lessons that to her she did a great job on because she exceeded the goal.  My daughter is very comfortable with the computer and iPad.  I can tell you this is the only program that has ever brought her to tears.  This is a horrible program."
0,Error messages. Missing parts; will not load correctly. Have trouble shot it and reloaded it and it still has error messages. I am not happy.
1,"Free, and it works well."
0,"This is terrible software. It does not communicate properly with the bank to download transactions correctly. It duplicates entries, resulting in completely erroneous transaction information and erroneous balances. I turned off the online bank downloads and enter my checks and other deposits and withdrawals manually. I use it only to generate reports from my manual entries, and it's weak on that, too, with poor category choices and poor category recognition. I should have saved my money and just created an Excel spreadsheet. I think it would work better and provide more utility."
1,"Great protection, regular updates, no issue with my PC. Does not have continuous pop ups about other products available for purchase."
0,"I've been using TurboTax for many years, decided to try H&R Block this year due to the recent bad practices of TurboTax. I was extremely disappointed with the switch. Yes, it easily imported my turbo tax file from last year. The interview process seemed fine. Then I ran into an issue where it would not e-file my state return due to my address being too long. When I clicked the option to take me to the form and fix the issue, it wouldn't let me change the address without clicking &#34;override&#34;...which apparently is an option making it impossible to e-file. I called the support # and waited 20 minutes, then gave up and just decided to mail my state return. Why should I go through all that trouble and then let H&R Block have even more of my money? NO thanks."
1,"We homeschool and in today's world, typing is just as important as handwriting. I bought this for my kids to learn typing skills, as their technology skills are far above their typing skills.<br /><br />Personally, my 6 year old 1st grader found the program frustrating, due to small hands. He liked the program, but just didn't have the dexterity for it, so we're holding off until next year.<br /><br />But my 9 year old LOVES it! He is doing great with it.<br /><br />The program is a bit confusing in navigation at times and both my children and I are quite good at techy stuff. But, once you figure it out and do it daily, it's okay.<br /><br />You can change the goal WPM if needed to suit different skill levels, so it might even work for an adult who pecks at the keyboard to improve their skills."
0,Purchased Fed and State from you.  Had to pay State to Intut again for the State before they would e-file it.  Did not recognize my purchase from you.  For that reason I would not recommend a purchase from you.  Also over priced!!  T
0,"Program works ok, but the Business part will not print the return. When I try to print it(business portion) freezes up. When I get the \\""print\\"" screen, after the \\""print return\\"" button, it shows it is trying to print over 40,000 pages. For example, the last attempt showed printing from \\""page 2408 to 60,438\\"" and no matter what I tried that is the type/and range of print pages I get.

0,I've been a quicken user since 19??. It's been a great product until 2012.  Since Quicken 2012 I haven't been able to download my bank transactions and my finances are a mess.  From my research I know that it is not a problem with my bank but a problem with Quicken. Just look at the forums. There are problems with banks all over the country. Quicken won't admit it and give information about what it is doing to fix the problem.  I'm going to have to find a new product to work with and this stinks.<br />Update April 2013:<br />The problem with my bank downloads seems to have been fixed.  Still don't trust quicken and will be very careful with every upgrade.
1,"I too went from MS Money to Quicken Rental Property Manager 2010. At first I was disappointed and ready to return it and get my money back.  I was so used to Money and didn't really give it a chance at first. As I played with it and came across problems it was just a matter of going to the help guide.  I did have to email Intuit with a question unanswerable through help or so I thought(I later found it after Intuit replied to my email request for assistance).  The more I played with it, the better it got. It does have some quirks, but I can work around them.  Overall I'm glad I got it."
0,"Adobe obviously believes their product – which IS quite good - is worth this pricing. I will, however, do without it for $20.00 a month… Absurd !"
1,"Greetings,<br /><br />First off, I bought this upgrade because I wanted to download the language packs and make my Laptop run smoother. I own a Sony VAIO E' series laptop running a 64-bit system and 8GB's of memory. You get EXACTLY what Amazon promises; An online code to enter it when prompted by Windows Anytime Upgrade. I didn't want to wait for a disc to show up on the mail. It's basicaly useless once you use the activation key anyway. The code is displayed right after the purchase is complete. You don't have to wait for it to get emailed to you or nothing like that. I highly recommend this method of upgrading to anyone who has Windows 7 Home Premium and is looking to upgrade to Ultimate. Just make sure you have Windows Anytime Upgrade. I read other reviews in which people were expecting to get a download link of some sort or a disc in the mail. Amazon Digital Services doesn't do that. I don't know how to use XP or Vista modes and I'm really not interested so I won't comment on that part of the software. I did notice that I got a suite of Windows Live tools. Windows Live Writer, Windows Live Mesh and Windows Live Family Safety. I am also now able to work in French. I also noticed that my laptop starts and shuts down a bit quicker. About 5 seconds quicker. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The key worked just fine. It is an authentic key not a trial like another reviewer posted. The entire process took about 15min. I have a rather slow internet connection so it might be less for you if you are using cable modem or satellite or you have a faster processor."
1,"Perfect upgrade, especially for longtime Office users who crave some enhancements. For example, quicker access to sort-coding, tailoring wookbook screens (supressing unwanted functions) that unnecessarily overcrowd the menu."
1,I am very happy with this version of Quicken and it was nice that I could get it very fast by way of downloading it.  It works just as well as the previous versions I have had and I have no complaints about it.  It does everything that I need to do.
0,Would not work with new windows and could not return item because it was downloaded.
1,I've been using avast for years now and it has saved my computer several times.<br />I feel safer with avast on my computer.

1,That's awesome! Thank you for the offer
1,"I have been using H&R Block tax software (previously called TaxCut) for many years. The newer versions have certainly improved the user experience, making it now easier and quicker to get through my tax preparation. The flow is intuitive and allows to sidestep into help and topic research without getting lost where you were. It wasn't always like that in previous versions but the last couple of years at least it has been much improved.<br />One thing that surprised me this tax year (2012) is that because of my particular tax situation I could not submit my form electronically but had to mail them in. I was not aware that there were such kind of exceptions to electronic filing. Needless to say I was happy I did not waste my time doing something that was not going to work. I am certain it saved me some headaches.<br />Please keep in mind that my comments are specific to the Deluxe version. Things get a bit involved when dealing with rental property AND stock-related transactions. The guided wizard/questionnaire guided me swimmingly and got me through the maze."
1,Yep more of my hard earned dollars wasted.  Program worked fine and guided me through the pain of calculating taxes and getting back what I could.
1,"I really like QuickBooks for it's ease of use, but they need to stop with the built in advertisements and upgrade features and services. The new 2013 is no different than the 2010 I had been using. It has a new layout and a few new features but overall it is about the same. Just now all the extra features that would really be neat as a built in cost you extra. Like Mobile QuickBooks should be a feature that comes with the new 2013 version. But instead costs you per month to use."
1,"Bottom line: this isn't as good as the PC version, there are some technical bugaboo's they've gone and changed the UI again, so those of you with previous versions of office will have to re-learn the menu structure, but with that said, there is no better office suite for the Mac. I have both this, and the apple suite (Pages, Numbers, etc) and this is much better than the apple line, which is riddled with compatibility issues."
1,"Simple, easy to use, very direct. Just read the features to figure out which best fits your needs. It worked great for me as a student, homeowner, hobbyist, and investor."
1,"I have used TurboTax for the last 6 years. I wouldn't think of doing my income taxes with any other software, or paying anyone else to do it for me either. This is the best product on the market hands down. I will never use another software other than TurboTax. Very easy to follow instructions if exploring on your own, and even easier if you let the software guide you. Love it and you will too!"
0,"My Quicken 2005 was humming along just fine, simple, all the information right there on two lines per entry.  I didn't need/want all the bells and whistles of Quicken 2015 MAC, and the learning curve that goes with figuring out formatting redos, name changes (like changing \\""Class\\"" to \\""Tag\\""), the pull downs needed for every entry of data, no unnecessary pie charts, no sidebars and fancy reports for things I don't want.  No, Intuit couldn't just offer a plain jane upgrade of my steady, readable, user friendly Quicken 2005 MAC making it compatible with MAC OSX-Yosemite.  All my memorized reports went poof in Q2015!  What a pain, and why, because I let myself get locked into Intuit products. And they got me with Turbo-Tax 2014 requiring an update my MAC OSX and that forced me to downgrade to Quicken 2015."
0,"Since there aren't currently any others, if you stumble across this review, here's the gist of the app: directions to make 10 different paper airplanes, each having a half dozen or so designs that can be printed in color or black & white.  I'm sure you could find similar designs and artwork on the internet for free. While the app runs on Windows 7 (though an error pops up for me), it is one of those older applications intended to run on an 800x600 screen, so the display will be small on higher resolutions. There's not much to the app, but then again I didn't really expect much and got it for free as part of a promotion."
1,"Quick and easy to use. Enabled me to file my tax return easily and with confidence that everything was entered correctly.  We- e-filing, I received my tax over payment quickly. I highly recommend using it."
1,"Turbo Tax is the easiest, safest and fastest way to file your taxes!  I use Turbo Tax every year and I am never disappointed!"
1,"No one enjoys doing their taxes, but Turbo Tax makes it bearable, especially if you've used it in prior years."
0,"No Schedule D in turbotax deluxe this year. Bad bad move, intuit. Very bad !"
1,Good product
1,A very thorough program.  Be alert and rested when using it.
0,Apparently in really small print somewhere this says that you can actually fill out the state return but you have to actually pay to file it.  This should be in very large print as what it looks like is that you file both federal and state when you purchase the product!
1,I have been using this product for 5 year now tt works really good as it is supposed to be.
1,"If you are selling an older version, it should be prominently noted and what to go and update. With no mention of this, I had to spend 30 minutes on trying to reach someone at Quicken for a very easy answer on how to update."
0,"All I wanted was a simple DVD player.<br /><br />I purchased windows media center and arcsoft total theater. They played DVD's and menu selections worked.<br /><br />But with PowerDVD I could also play DLNA streaming. An added bonus. When I inserted a CD, when the DVD menu appeared, I selected an item from the menu. The application promptly crashed. After several attempts all resulting in a crash. I decided to file a support request. I received a two page list of debugging work to perform and send back. It did not matter that only the PowerDVD software did not work.<br /><br />Gave up and took the purchase as a loss. Plus there was a language issue. The support people had difficulty understanding written English. I was unable to state the problem clearly to the personnel.<br /><br />If you buy it and tit works, you will be very happy with the purchase. If there is a problem. Well good luck."
1,I used to use version 2.0 and just upgraded to Lightroom 4.0. I love the added integration with facebook and flickr. Lightroom in general is a solid program especially for the price. It's worth the purchase.
1,"For a small staffed web design company, we are able to quickly and easily send out recurring invoicing, hook to the business bank account and update or records absolutely anywhere including a QB App for my Android.<br /><br />www.webdesignfl.co"
0,"Have not used it that much but what I have use it for has worked just fine. It does take a while to load,."
1,I had been waiting for a mobile version for some time now and was excited to see the 2013 version allowed for this. The early reviews did not seem promising and held off getting it. The later reviews seemed to notice some improvements were made and I went ahead and purchased the download.  The download went smoothly for me and setting up my Apple phone worked very well with it. The only thing was I had to tinker with was I have used Quicken for a long time and the program was recognizing the bank names for my accounts but not my created names that I made for them from an earlier version. Once I deleted off the old names and matched them to how they came across the web on the update from the bank then I had no more issues. I am pleased with how this works.
0,Very poor product. Would not preform correctly. Customer service was not helpful either. All the way around I would not recommend anyone to purchase this software.
0,"I have a WIndows 7 machine.  It has been impossible to install this program.  It is complaining there is a .NET 4, which there is.  I removed it and reinstalled it, it verifies, bu tTurbo Tax insists it does not exist.  Unfortunately there seems to be no way around, so yet another reason to leave Turbo Tax with crappy installers and removing features to milk a few more bucks out of you :-("
1,This is an excellent software application. I'm so glad I found it. The numerous extension mechanisms allows me to use the built in Writer application more than Microsoft Word.  Highly recommended.
1,I always used to use H&R block software in the past but for 2012 they did not have good reviews and were missing approved forms so I switched to TurboTax and was very happy with my decision.  The software worked well and had all the forms we needed.  I will continue to use Turbotax from now on.
0,Did not work.
0,"I used H&R Block business version for past three years with good impression. Current version is the fourth year - but a nightmare. At business tax part,  I could not fill 1065 K-1 naturally. At home tax part, it messes foreign tax and does not show Sch D. Feel so alien in using the software. The system only goes forward from interview to items in tax field somewhere, not from tax field back to correspondent interview questions. So, when review part pointing out warnings, it is hard to correct them. One has to be very familiar with all tax issues to use the software. But if that's the case, why not directly fill government's form.<br /><br />The interview GUI does not align with 125% screen fonts (for 4 years now); 1366x768 screen would be too small to show interview and tax form together. PDF output does not work unless go through PDF995. The business part keeps crash on my Windows Server 2012 after update. Even worse, my anti-virus software pointed out, \HR_Block Business 2014\Tax2014.exe, contains HEUR/QVM13.0.Malware.Gen. I downloaded the software from Amazon several times, and the same malware shows up every time. Well, this year I would have to fill the tax by hand."
0,"As a result, I ended up having to buy two programs.  I originally purchased the Small Business product (since I have an incorporated small business) but it was not the correct product for an S Corp.  That was not indicated in the product information so while in the middle of using the Small Business product I ended up having to buy this one online. When I went back I saw that a few of the reviewers noted this about the Small Business program, but I shouldn't have to learn this from a review.  So other than having wasted money on two programs, one of which was useless, this one was fine, but there should have been better clarificaton of the differences between the product."
1,"I have been a Quicken for DOS/Windows user for 20 years. The main reason I have a Windows virtual machine on my Mac is to run Quicken. I have tried Quicken Mac 2007 and Quicken Essentials, but rejected them because they did not have all the features I use on Quicken Windows 2009 (QW 2009). I have been avoiding Quicken Mac 2015 because it is lacking many of those same features, and because it cannot transfer the data from my QW 2009 file.<br /><br />Then I had an EPIPHANY: What if I started from scratch? Why if I stopped the tedious, old-fashioned manual entry of every single transaction, and instead let the computer do the work? (I was never successful getting QW 2009 to download transactions.) Do I really need to transfer 20+ years of history, history I'm not even sure that I trust?<br /><br />(When I transferred my data to Quicken Essentials I had to manually fix numerous errors, errors that I believe are in my QW file. That data was originally in a pre-1995 database, then transferred to Quicken/DOS, then transferred to QW, then upgraded to newer data formats over the years for newer versions of QW. The history in my 401(k) account, in particular, is particularly suspicious because support for that evolved in QW over the years.)<br /><br />So, in spite of the absolutely horrible reviews of Quicken 2015 for Mac, I decided to once again try switching from Quicken/Windows to Quicken/Mac.<br /><br />I am so glad that I did. Doing my bookkeeping is fun again, and a lot less tedious. Sure, it lacks many of the QW features, but I have decided that I can live with that. The features that it does have work BRILLIANTLY. Sure, it only downloaded a few months of initial data from my financial institutions, but I believe that is a constraint imposed by the institutions, not Quicken. The data that it does download looks accurate, and, once I have \\""trained\\"" it, Quicken is even smart enough to assign the correct Payee and Category to most of the downloaded transactions. I only need to examine each new download, make some minor changes, and I am done. When the statement for my account arrives, reconciling it is a snap (so much better than when I had to manually enter every transaction before I could reconcile).<br /><br />Honestly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Maybe the unsatisfied users need to reevaluate what it is that they are trying to accomplish. I did, and now I have one less reason to use my Windows VM. Thank you, Intuit, for this wonderful program, and I look forward to future updates and upgrades."

1,"Would do this again, super simple.  Did at a later time not required to do right away. Will protect my computer!!"
1,I got tired of malware and viruses getting past my old software so I am trying PC Matic. So far so good!
0,"Norton 360 was working fine until an update then it did not work properly and I could not even get to the screens on Norton.  Online support people did not have a clue.  Their diagnosis was I had a some video problem on my computer even though all other programs like Word, Excel, and browser were working fine.  Their solution was to force my display to low resolution VGA!  Then they told me the problem was in my computer.  I searched the internet and found that Norton was not working for other people that had this problem after some software updates.  I dumped Norton and switched to AVG which is working great!  This cost me some money but now my system works.  Too bad Norton has become so technically incompetent...<br /><br />Bad Design and Support Changed to Competitor AVG ... Disappointing"
0,I did not keep it.
1,"Recommended and installed by my computer repair guy after removing a bad virus. Have AVAST on all of our computers now. The program updates itself. I did have an issue a few years ago, but it was corrected by removal and reinstallation.<br /><br />I am satisfied with AVAST."
1,"As I expected, it works really good"
1,Used this product for a few years now. Easy to use and less money than Turbo Tax.
1,"Just upgraded to Mac OS X Lion, and this software DOES work flawlessly with the new OS.  I had read that others have had problems, but we have intel iMacs and Mac Minis in our offices and it works great on all of them.<br /><br />We were using the windows version of office 2010 with parallells on our Macs, but the dedicated Mac version of Office is much more user friendly and elegant."
1,Nothing better.  Awesome.
1,"The only thing that I do not like about this product is that it slows the computer down. Other than that, It is great."
0,I have used Quicken for years with no problems and no complaints; recently however the program is troublesome; I continue to be unable or only sometimes able to download transactions from certain financial institutions...especially problematic is Wells Fargo. And why am I suddenly being asked for an Intuit Password when doing an update. I find myself beginning to lose confidence in a software that has always been  troublefree. Should I trust my Income Tax to Turbo Tax? I waver.
1,Great deal!
1,I have been using Norton 360 for a few years now and still no complaints. This version is easy to install and effective. Great protection for your PC!
1,This product works well and was competitively priced.  I must say though that I was only able to use it on two PC as the third pc could connect to your server for some reason??!!
0,"Price to upgrade should be lower for prime member. Decent service, still in Beta looks...can't wait for more polished interface"
1,"Avast! Free Antivirus 2014 is great!  It's entirely free, reliable and doesn't slow my computer down.  I recommend it to anyone looking for good antivirus software!"
1,"Okay, this actual review is being written with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium.<br /><br />What I'm going to do is simply speak the words and not do any correction so that you can see how accurate it is.<br /><br />This time around, Dragon NaturallySpeaking is vastly more integrated with all your applications, for instance, I use chrome as my browser and, previously, if I were entering a review as I am right now Dragon NaturallySpeaking would invoke something called the DragonPad which would accept my speech into a notepad like little application. Once I was finished dictating my review, the DragonPad would allow me to transfer my results into the browser text box. Now this may not seem like a big deal, but it really is, it was really distracting to use the DragonPad and on more than one occasion I lost my text because of switching away to go to another application and then coming back.<br /><br />Now, I should clarify that I am using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium with Windows 8.one on a Samsung all-in-one desktop with eight gigs of RAM. This is a powerful desktop but definitely not a screamer or a gaming machine, and yet, Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium has no problem at all quickly turning my voice and words into text.<br /><br />So, thus far we have a new version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking that is much more integrated with the apps that you know and use every day.<br /><br />Now, onto the software itself, Dragon has definitely made improvements in the UI but it is still really the same underlying core software in terms of its user interface, not much has changed their. Notice that little there is incorrect. Also, my machine is running the 64-bit version of Windows and the Dragon NaturallySpeaking software is still 32 bit, as far as I can tell, that's a little bit of a gripe but it doesn't seem to affect the performance.<br /><br />Now performance, is what you want, and Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium definitely performs at a much higher and more accurate level than Dragon 12 did. I am very very pleased with the new version.<br /><br />One of the things that you notice right out of the box, is that the set up is very different from the previous versions, this version requires almost no training whatsoever, and, I had far fewer technical hiccups with this version, for instance, previous versions had difficulty with setting the levels on the microphone that I use which is a Logitech USB headset, nothing special either just a generic headset.<br /><br />Another really nice improvement which I have actually tried out with this version, is that this version can use your WebCam Mike as the audio source, one of the things that I did was try out the WebCam Mike to see how well it worked, it was pure coincidence that my daughter happen to have a few friends over that day and were making all sorts of noise in the house, and yet, Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 performed very well given the noise level.<br /><br />Nuance gives you a chance to upgrade with a special price if your prior owner, since I have been a Dragon NaturallySpeaking customer since version 10 or so, I have been getting my upgrades for each new version directly from Nuance, we have come a long way together!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the fastest, most accurate, and most pleasant to use version of Dragon yet I am happy to be a supporting customer and to see that Dragon, excuse me, Nuance is putting their revenue into research and development.<br /><br />Now, I am here approaching the end of this review and I am happy to report that not a single error has been corrected, I have dictated this entire review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium, I have corrected contextual errors of my own but no recognition errors have been removed.<br /><br />I highly recommend Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13!e accurate level than Dragon 12 did. I am very very pleased with the new version.<br /><br />One of the things that you notice right out of the box, is that the set up is very different from the previous versions, this version requires almost no training whatsoever, and, I had far fewer technical hiccups with this version, for instance, previous versions had difficulty with setting the levels on the microphone that I use which is a Logitech USB headset, nothing special either just a generic headset.<br /><br />Another really nice improvement which I have actually tried out with this version, is that this version can use your WebCam Mike as the audio source, one of the things that I did was try out the WebCam Mike to see how well it worked, it was pure coincidence that my daughter happen to have a few friends over that day and were making all sorts of noise in the house, and yet, Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 performed very well given the noise level.<br /><br />Nuance gives you a chance to upgrade with a special price if your prior owner, since I have been a Dragon NaturallySpeaking customer since version 10 or so, I have been getting my upgrades for each new version directly from Nuance, we have come a long way together!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the fastest, most accurate, and most pleasant to use version of Dragon yet I am happy to be a supporting customer and to see that Dragon, excuse me, Nuance is putting their revenue into research and development.<br /><br />Now, I am here approaching the end of this review and I am happy to report that not a single error has been corrected, I have dictated this entire review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 premium, I have corrected contextual errors of my own but no recognition errors have been removed.<br /><br />I highly recommend Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13!"

1,My son &#34;a computer nerd&#34; put this on all of our family computers.  It works great and doesn't bog down the computer.  Highly recommend!
1,Product worked as advertised
0,Waste of MONEY!! I would not waste a dime on this...
0,"we're a full on property management company. It took us a week to enter our residents and get it up and running, calling quicken multiple times, since they dont have any kind of system that actually answers your questions, all to find out it is pretty much what we do already with excel spreadsheets, and has no tenant ledger. That means if you go to see how much your resident owes, you cant. At least we got a great deal from a different website. Probably is a decent product for someone else. Really frustrating to try to learn it without a manual"
0,The loan feature has been totally ruined so non-usable.  Way too rigid.  Does not allow changes or dates prior to present.  Interest calculation is incorrect.  Having problems with it shutting down.  Total disappointment.  Other &#34;improvements&#34; such as some reporting not worth the ruination of the loans.
0,"It says it is for both PC and MAC, but the MAC version doesn't work at all.  Tried many times.  Worse, the Windows version on 8.1 just spins on the Surface, meaning you cannot get to the app's user interface.  It is a terrible waste of money."
1,"This was a great refresher, they go over the content three times, first casually, second slowly, third with translation always go over local customs that have to do with the content and the two speakers are natural and kind of funny def recommend!"

1,A very large program with more than just antivirus. Has software updater and other features.
0,"Don't buy. Just junk. Not worth 2 cents.One could use notebook pages just as easily. I have my own system and thought this might be better, I'll stick with mine."
0,"I have used turoboTax in the past and it is easy to use, but part of why I buy it is for the free e-file. My taxes included and energy credit that required my return to be mailed in, so kind of a waste for me."
0,"Crashed my computer X3, kept saying I had no internet connection when I was on the internet with Amazon.  Don't know what or who changed things since last year but as far as I am concerned it is a disaster... been working on this for 3 hr with not good results.  If I could figure out how to return a download I would get it from TurboTax directly.... sorry Amazon your services have really dropped the ball."
1,We have been using H&R Block Tax Software for the past 3 years. It's simple to use and I feel they do get the best return. I'll continue to use this software for year to come. It's also wonderful to be able to digitally download it from Amazon. We had no hiccups when downloading.
0,"I am really disappointed in the 2015 Quicken.  Piece of crap, impossible to reconcile bank accounts on this version and only carries balance when in the date column. Quicken 2013 was much better.  I have to download my bank information twice in order to show the online balance. Won't buy this piece of crap again. Help files did not solve the problem and the online chat help couldn't help either."
0,"The download is not a stand-alone product, a fast Internet connection . I live in a remote region with only Satellite internet and find the product essentially unusable because of my connection limitations . I wrote the manufacturer and received a bunch of different responses including one that said they would send me the CD which is stand alone. I responded with an address for shipping but the CD was never received. If you are thinking of buying this product, get the CD version."
1,"Easy to use, but did not get the state tax filed for free like the ads said.  I was charged $19.99 to file the state tax through Turbo tax.  I emailed Turbo tax about why this happened and got no response."
1,Works well and has stopped things from taking over the system and causing problems.  Especially like that it does not cost any thing.  Bought because<br />Consumer Reports recommended it.
1,"I am very pleased with this download and the reduced price compared to the Intuit website. I have had none of the problems others in the 1 and 2 star categories have had.<br /><br />Download:  I downloaded it to a 2 1/2 year old Toshiba laptop running Windows 7 on my home wireless network that on Speedtest is getting 44 Mbps download.  It took 45 seconds to download<br /><br />Installation:  The install took 30 seconds, plus 2 minutes to reboot, plus 1 min. 45 sec. for the data conversion (about 155,000 items), about 1 minute for the upgrade to release 3.<br /><br />Performance:  It looks very similar to the 2012 version I was running, but cleaner.  The program loads much faster and everything runs quicker.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this upgrade.  I would have given it 5 stars except for my dislike of 2 of Intuit's policies: 1) They charge the same each year for longtime users to upgrade from previous versions as they do if you are buying the product for the first time. The software doesn't change that much each year.  2) Their policy of disabling transaction downloads to versions more than 2 years old.  There is no need for this other than forcing everyone to upgrade.  I was very content with the 2012 version.  As long as I can do this every 3 years and can find it at a discounted price, I'll continue to do that.  Go Amazon!"
1,works!
0,"The tax program itself is quite good, but it seems very unreasonable for the cost to consumers of this software package keeps increasing each and every year!"
1,"The 2013 version seemed to flow better than previous versions.  Although I have not filed my return (I'm a bit late), the program seems to manage the return better.  Amazon price was best available and download was seamless, which has not always been the case in the past."
1,"The Complete version has worked effortlessly. Setup is quick, but deceptively easy. Please, visit Webroot's website and the tutorials, FAQ's, and especially their use of &#34;cloud.&#34; Then, you will never have to contact their tech support as I had. Tech support was more than adequate, but it took time waiting. No other advice is needed, however. Complete does exactly what is advertised; the product is the best I have ever used - and, I have used every product with more than ten years of service, including Norton. The response to aggressive websites with non-friendly & horrid malware was exact and absolutely safe to my system. Upgrading and updating was seamless and fast, transparent and informative at every important step. I urge you to try the product, it's worth the effort, before renewing your present Internet security. Then, inform yourself! You will never look back. I bought the two-year extension; and, I shall again!"
0,"After waiting out every update because of the awful reviews, I finally had to update from 2011 to continue getting online updates. The reviews were accurate, and I am now looking for new financial management software. The product is buggy if you can even read the screen; there are so many times where data is overshadowed by pop ups or the text does not fit in the box and you cannot expand to see what it would say. I have used Quicken since the DOS days, but no more. The menus have been changed to make it more confusing. This is pathetic."
1,Easy to download. Did not take as long as I thought it would. Wasn't able to use my Discover  benefits like I thought I could.
1,I have been using this product since the 1980's before Block became the owner.  I started with an Apple 2e and have continued to be pleased with the revisions made each year.  It has served my needs well each year.  Totally satisfied
0,"Didn't realize that I would have to purchase the Premier in order to complete my tax return.  When looking at the different tax programs, it stated that I would still only need the Deluxe but since I have sale of stock - I was required to upgrade - that was not what I expected.  I know I'm suppose to be able to get a refund of $25.00 after I file. - hope that will really work"
0,TurboTax may be falling on their sword after being busted but it does not hide the fact they were trying to extort more money from their customer base.  H&R Block will import your old TurboTax return and includes investment features and forms.  This screw up is going to cost TurboTax a lot of money and somebody there needs to get fired.
0,"I bought it and cannot download it. It looks like it is trying to use an internet browser and then it keeps saying &#34;download error occurred.&#34; I do not know what is going on, but it definitely isn't a normal amazon download. I am starting to question if it is a real thing or not. If it is, I hope it gets fixed because this software seemed like a good opportunity."
0,I ordered this as an upgrade and could not install it.  It kept giving me error messages.  I needed to have it running right away and so I ordered a copy directly from Intuit which installed right away.
0,This installation was worse than child birth.  no more words needed. this is stupid to boot.  will not use again  Ray Walker

1,"avast! is a great antivirus. I only use the free version and have never run into a virus, and I am a huge downloader. Thanks avast! for a great program."
0,"I have both WebPlus and PagePlus as a disc not a download. Neither program would install on a Win7 computer. There is no customer support, just a thread blog where other customers trade problems. But you can't use this unless you register the product.<br />Neither product would register. I'm returning both and I'll never touch anything from Serif again. I had techs at three different repair shops try to install them and they got the same results. I assume that all of these great reviews are &#34;paid-fors&#34;. The repair techs told me that they've always had these problems with Serif."
1,Quick and easy. Expensive.
1,Works great with no problem so far! Excellent choice!
1,I have been using Norton 360 for several years now it does a good job of protecting our computers and helps greatly when there is a problem to sort it out and get it fixed. The Amazon price was very attractive compared to renewing through Symantec. But it would have helped to have instructions on how to install and activate if you have a current account. It took me a while to figure out that even though I downloaded the software and installed it that I had to actually go into my Norton account to activate it.
1,The organizer is much improved in this version. Great alternative to PhotoShop CC
0,"First off, let me say that it did get my laptop to work normally once again. However, the pop-ups are really annoying. My computer has also shut down 3 times since I have downloaded the product about 2 weeks ago. This is definitely a problem for me. There isn't much I can really expect from a anti-virus that was free. I will definitely be purchasing another anti-virus that I know will get my laptop on the right track."
0,I don't think this is as user friendly as my old 2007 version. I wish I had bought that version for my new computer.
1,"This software magnifies things on the screen. While that may sound simplistic, it is exactly what I needed it to do, and it works well."
1,Always my choice of internet safety and computer malware.  Have used it for my security for years and love the password security and ability to store safely

0,"Product works well for completing my taxes... but... Too many costs... (Upon review they are not technically hidden but aren't exactly clear either).  If you have more than 1 state, it may be more cost effective and better use of your time to use a professional.  So I purchase the product which includes federal (including free federal efile) + 1 state product.  I have to file in 2 states so I have to buy another state product.  Then I have to pay again to efile each state because purchasing a state product only gives you the product but not free state efile.  So I pay 48.36 for the base product + another 42.99 to buy an additional state + another 24.99 to file the first state + another 24.99 to file the second state for a total of 141.33.  My taxes are not that complicated other than the fact I worked in 2 states.  For 141.33, I will be having a professional complete my taxes for a few dollars more and not deal with this in the future."
1,Avast Free Antvirus replaced my Noton system  and I've never considered going back. I rate it a four star because they continue to tweak the program to MY benefit.
1,I've been using avast now for 3 years and it has worked well for me. It has caught 3 viruses and a lot of malware. It has kept 3 computers up and running  and virus free so far
1,Needed office for school and I have a mac. There are a lot of differences between pc/mac versions but its still very user friendly.
0,Typical MS product. Downloaded with minimal problems. See customer Reviews for detail info as it may apply to your use.
0,Too difficult to navigate. I've made several attempts at using it. Finally uninstalled.<br />Could not get photos from  my HD to edit.
1,I like this but have used it like I should be so I will try it again
0,"Beware, there are issues is you are trying to upgrade from Outlook Express or Windows Live mail to Outlook 2013.  I am migrating my business email from Outlook Express to Outlook 2013 due to an upgrade to Win8, and upgrading from Outlook Express is a real disaster.  I figured since I am going from MS email product to MS email product, it would be straightforward.  I was wrong.  Here is what I found online when trying to figure this MESS out:<br /><br />From \\""Article ID: 2796528\\""  on Microsoft's website:<br /><br />This only leaves you with the option of exporting email and addresses from Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail, and into Outlook 2013. However, the export option has a limitation. Outlook Express and Windows Live Mail are unable to export to Outlook if the 64-bit version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Outlook is installed.<br /><br />To export your email and contacts from Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail, and into Outlook 2013, you must uninstall the 64-bit version of Office or Outlook and then install the 32-bit version. Alternatively, you can migrate your data on another computer that has a 32-bit version of Outlook. The 32-bit version can be Outlook 2013 or earlier.<br /><br />Workarounds (again from Microsoft's website)<br />These are the two workarounds to help get your email and contacts into your local copy of Outlook:<br /><br />Export your mail from Windows Mail using another computer that has an Outlook (32-bit) version installed, then move the resulting .pst file to the Outlook 2013 (64-bit) client. The default location of your Outlook 2013<br /><br />Uninstall Office 2013 (64-bit) and install Office 2013 (32-bit), and then export from Live Mail to the Outlook 2013 (32 bit) version.<br /><br />Maybe this is easy for most people, but I am trying to run a cabinet business and this is very frustrating and time consuming."
1,Software is still good but change of what was included in the Deluxe edition was disturbing.  Appears TurboTax took care of the problem and will return to original version next year.  Will wait and see.
0,Works ok
0,"Despite the bad reviews saying the software was buggy, I thought that I would be fine.  I thought that because I have been a quicken user for over a decade and am extremely tech savvy, that I could work through any problems.  I also thought that this was an incremental upgrade that probably would work at least as well as other R1 releases from years prior.  Quicken proved me wrong -- very wrong.<br /><br />I upgraded from 2013 for the mobile app and the credit score.  Two weeks in, we still can't get either feature to work.  It appears that I am being punished for being an intuit user for many years with different products, because the software  thinks there is a duplicate ID.  I can't get Intuit to just delete the duplicate intuit IDs.<br /><br />I have contacted quicken support by email and by chatting, but they have not been able to fix the issue and never get back to me with a resolution after escalating it.  Intuit also got rid of phone support  (because they don't value their customers), so you end up chatting with someone who is clearly chatting with 4 other people at the same time.<br /><br />Honestly, I regret my purchase, and I recommend that you not upgrade if you can avoid doing so.  The features are simply not worth the price of the software and definitely not worth your time."
1,"I was going to hire a tax accountant to do my taxes this year because now I'm retired. Well, that would have cost a lot of money so I thought I would try Turbo Tax and it was a breeze!  Walked me through everything and I am definitely not good with numbers.  I would recommend this for anyone.  I have my refund back already!"
0,"still the application is quick...<br />it doesn't seem to wipe out the yahoo toolbar and homepage changing trojan that stalks some computers...<br />I seem to be safe from malware... but, I hedge my protection with malwarebytes...<br /><br />and I know iOrbit wants to sell product (of which I have bought a license)...<br />But, they need to stop so many interruptions with pop-up banner ad's for updating to pro...<br /><br />(Updated 1/22/15) that's it!!! After calling the company with a minor issue regarding settings; I was fed the usual drivel about needing extra help and more 24hr service to clean the machine and guard against viruses etc...etc...<br /> I took this adware laden crap off my machine. This used to be a good product, but now besides the ad's; they now have some kind of extra subscription based computer technician service.<br />For X amount of dollars they will log in (with an overseas technician---NO THANK YOU) and remotely clean and tune your machine.<br /><br />You need to download a special Uninstaller to get Avast off of your machine... and it still leaves a lot of files scattered around the hard drive... also, Avast shuts off your built in Windows Defender... I finally had to hire a trusted computer pro to completely clean out Avast and restore Windows Defender along with some other security software...<br /><br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, LEAVE THIS PROGRAM ALONE"
0,There is no reason that I can see to buy this. You can buy the one that includes both the state and federal from amazon for $40.

PLEASE FIND AN ALTERNATIVE.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SAVE YOURSELF THE PAINFUL HEADACHE I'M GOING THOUGH RIGHT NOW.  YOU BEEN WARNED."
0,"Here is my review, originally posted in March 2014 and now mysteriously missing from the Amazon review pages.<br /><br />As a loyal Quicken user since 1997, and one who buys the new version every year, I am astonished at how bad this new release is.  With each new release, Quicken works well and I can safely ignore negative reviews.  NO LONGER!  The number of new usability problems introduced with Quicken Premier 2014 (on Windows 7) is so large that it seems clear the product was rushed to market to meet Intuit's annual new release (new revenue?) deadline without performing sufficient quality assurance. Below I will list the problems I have discovered so far, and I will update my review if and when any new interim releases resolve these problems.<br /><br />KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ARE BROKEN IN THE REGISTER VIEW. The Register view is the bread and butter of Quicken: this is where you enter and review transactions. Common functions such as cut, copy, and paste of text fields (Control-X, Control-C, and Control-P) do not work - I must use the mouse and select these functions from the Edit menu (which still lists the keyboard shortcuts). Similarly, Control-R does not bring up the Reconcile window, Control-J does not (always) bring up the Bill and Income Reminders window, Control-S does not bring up the Split Transaction window, Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys do not shift focus to adjacent transactions, etc. These problems are especially noticeable when switching to another application, then back to Quicken.<br /><br />KEYBOARD FOCUS IS LOST IN THE REGISTER VIEW. If I highlight a text field such as Payee or Amount, then switch to another application and switch back to Quicken, the highlighted field is no longer active. This means I must use the mouse to re-select the field before I can begin typing a value. It's often the case that I will switch apps - for example, when reviewing a credit card statement and comparing transactions. This particular problem makes me think the name&#34;Quicken&#34; should be changed to &#34;Slowen&#34;.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD TRANSACTIONS / BILL AND INCOME REMINDERS PANE IS ~ALWAYS~ PRESENT. When switching to the Register view from one account to another account, this pane at the bottom of the view is always presented in maximized form, which minimizes the number of transactions I see in the Register. Previously, this pane only appeared when there were unprocessed downloaded transactions or active reminders for the account. It's annoying to have to close the view every time I switch between account registers to review or enter transactions. I can see 10 transactions (2-line display) with the pane closed, but only 3 transactions when the pane is open.<br /><br />DOWNLOADED TRANSACTION RED FLAG. After One Step Update, Quicken shows a red flag for accounts with new transactions. Sometimes I will see the red flag, go to that account register, and find NO downloaded transactions (particularly for investment accounts). If I perform One Step Update again, or just select Update Transactions, sometimes the new transactions will appear as expected.<br /><br />ONE STEP UPDATE FAILS CONSISTENTLY FOR SOME ACCOUNTS. I have seen numerous errors for Wells Fargo Bank and PayPal. I have disabled and re-enabled One Step Update for these accounts numerous times, with no improvement.<br /><br />ATTACH RECEIPT TO TRANSACTION. I became a huge fan of this feature in the previous 2013 release. I could scan a paper receipt or document to a PDF file, attach that file to a transaction, and discard the receipt. After attaching the file, a Quicken window would display the receipt, providing instant confirmation that the correct file was attached. But in Quicken 2014, the attachment shows up only as a generic PDF icon. To verify the attached file, I must double-click the icon to open Adobe Reader. To view any existing attachment, I must click multiple times to bring up the external Adobe Reader. On the support chat rooms, Intuit says the newbehavior is necessary to support attaching other file types such as photo images taken with smart phones. Really? This is the same Quicken product that uses a built-in (and very antiquated) web browser to navigate to the web sites of financial institutions (rather than simply launching your favorite browser). Can't they include a PDF and JPG viewer in the application?<br /><br />As of March 28, 2014, I'm using the latest R7 version of Quicken Premier 2014 for Windows. As I stated at the top of this review, I'll update this review if and when any of these problems is resolved in an interim release. For the time being, avoid this release and stick with Quicken 2013 or earlier."
1,"This was a great way to upgrade my computer without spending hundreds on all the software I needed. This way, I'm just &#34;renting&#34; Office for a year at a time for only $100. BTW, my first 24 hours with Office 2013 has been awesome... I'm really impressed with the increased speed and stability of this version. (I upgraded from Office 2010.)"
0,man this thing sucks. won't download from the bank and it has been over a week. buyers beware. 2014 was a lot better.
0,Be carefull It did not work on my computer.<br />Good luck for you if you want to use this product
0,"Microsoft is so busy trying to be Apple want to bes that they have destroyed everything that made them a product worth having. First I get stuck with Windows 8 when my computer broke, I tried to go back to Vista which I thought was bad enough but no go. Now this windows 2013. I stopped using Outlook back several versions ago when they made it so if you were logged into your computer there was no separate password on your email, so its open for anyone that happens by your computer. Now you can't not download it. Not only that, your looking at something as visually appealing as DOS and wondering if you confidential files are accidentally going to wind up on your facebook, the web or in some shared application because it doesn't allow you to set your software up to suit your own needs for work or for privacy. Lets face it Microsoft is going down hill so fast that they will never be able to fix the mess they have made of their operating systems nor their software. Can anyone recommend any other office software that I can go spend a fortune on but that will work and not turn everything I create into a social media post."
1,I have been using this program for many years.  Always satisfied.<br />I have never had an audit using Turbo Tax.<br />Highly recommended.
0,i cant tell the difference between this and the 2011 version of the software.
0,"I purchased this card program as a replacement for American greetings create-a-card 3. Which will not work on my windows 7 64 bit O.S.? As most people know once you find a card program it is hard to find a replacement one that does Cards the way you like. I found this program very hard to do a quick personalized card, And the card size that I was used to using, It does work and has a lot of other gadgets that I don't use but I can make cards if I plan ahead as it will take an hour instead of just 5 min compared to my old program. And be prepared for doing your cards over a few times as it does not always print the same way depending on what card you make. I am not real happy with this card program and if you do the down load don't download the complete program as it will never finish, there is no download manager to continue were you leave off form.  You will have to do it right from the beginning only to have it stop and try all over again. My advice buy the disk don't download."
0,Won't even open now!!!
0,"Nothing really new, except for credit score. Have not used this feature yet. Forced to upgrade from 2012 version in order to continue to update stocks. CTRL+ keyboard shortcuts no longer work or work sporadically; seems to have been reported in version 2014 and continues to be an uncorrected problem. Quicken chat support of no real help. Don't bother upgrading unless you have too."
1,Still protecting well after 4 months
1,Its fast and easy to setup. GUI is simple. So far never had any virus issues on my pc. Good product.
1,Straight forward and easy to use.<br />State E-File needs additional payment
1,"I switched to H&R Block Deluxe after Intuit tried their price gouging routine and then were disingenuous about the reason for the price increase. While the H&R block interface is not quite as easy to use as Turbotax, the software did the job at half the price. After my positive experience with H&R Block, I plan to use the software in the future."
0,Takes a lot of resources and slows down web browsing.<br />Will not renew subscription.<br /><br />Will be un-installing and will look for another anti virus solution.
1,"Not much change that I can see, but Quicken is the best software out there having tried mmost of the others."
0,The product is good but Every three years you have to upgrade and you do not get much for each so called upgrade.
1,If it weren't for the premier edition I wouldn't get my five figure return every year. I never knew of so many legal deductions I can take makes the year worth waiting for .
0,The H&R Block software failed to import:<br />1. W-2 (seriously?)<br />2. E-Trade 1099<br /><br />The H&R Block software does not support importing of:<br />3. Capital One 360 1099<br />4. TradeKing 1099
1,This is v good. I like this. You also like this. Please buy this. This is free. This is like ms office
1,"Can you really &#34;like&#34; a tax software?  I used to use TurboTax for years, but switched as this is cheaper and I read a LOT of negative reviews for it this tax season.  The switch was easy - the software imports your past tax return from TurboTax very quickly, and the interface is as easy to use as TurboTax, and I even liked it a bit more."
1,Excellent is expected thanks.
1,"Overall better than last version, getting close to what MS Money once had."
1,Works better and faster than McAfee
1,"I've used avast! for years, and it always seems to get the job done.  Stops attacks or dangerous situations most of the time, and is reasonably easy to use.  Always my go-to program for basic, but good virus protection.  I've installed it on countless machines for friends and family, and my own devices (tablets, PC's, etc).  Not much else to say, really.  Solid program, gets the job done, and I'll be using avast! for the foreseeable future."
0,Been a user since the DOS days .... this version pretty much sucks ... new features don't work ... things that work one day don't work the next ... the interface to mobile is spotty at best ... in other words I spent a lot of money and only got headaches ... oh and Intuit no longer gives any phone support instead they expect the users to support each other - nice they take the money and then you all support each other .... they will reluctantly do a live chat if your lucky .... I currently have a feature dealing with my investments I use everyday and really need stopped working and I can't figure out why .... BTW I am retired from computer work so if you don't have a computer background lots of luck .... I will be changing to something else
1,"I've been using Quicken for many yrs, and this new update insures that I will continue to do so. Love the app for my iPhone/iPad!  Love the way all my accts. sync up<br /><br />Great job!"
1,"I got this to replace TurboTax. It looks like it will be just as good, and cheaper! (but I have not completed a return yet).  After more use, I have following complaints: 1. Import from bank/broker is limited to those with agreements; my broker (Raymond James) was not included - this is a killer. 2. US government interest was passed to state calculation as a 2 digit % of income rather than actual value. This is inaccurate. 3. Foreign tax calculation may not be correct (disagrees with TurboTax).  Otherwise, it worked well with no problems."
0,"I like the product, but I don't like that I am forced to upgrade to the next version.  The 2011 version I had worked just fine, and it's not like you have to change anything to support the older version.  I don't need any new features.  There was no need to disable me downloading my financial transactions from my own bank!!!"
1,I would highly recommend Avast.  My computer was having problems and I took it to a retired computer tech who fixes computers from home.  He recommended it and installed it.  He said it was the best free antivirus out there as of late.  I feel it is very comprehensive and user friendly other than it does pop up for you to buy the other version a few times a week.
0,For some reason I couldn't get it to work.
1,Purchased for a friend.  Haven't found a consumer product to beat it yet.
1,"If you are like me you try to do your own taxes too. If you are filing EIC, student loan interest, etc it no longer is something that you can completely do on your own. This software walks you right the entire process very simply. I was done with the entire process in about an hour all together."
0,Save your money on this and go speak to someone really it will save you more money on the back end.
0,Warning!  I bought this program thinking it would be quick since I used H&R block online last year.  It will not import any information from the online program.  Everything has to be started over from scratch.  This is after it took me 45 minutes to load it with customer help because I was missing a key code.  I have used computer tax programs for decades and this is the worst experience I have ever had.  Customer service was of no help other than to tell me the program won't import from online.
1,"Easy to figure out. If I can do it, you can do it too.<br />Was nervous at first but was easy."
1,"Downloaded and installed very fast and I have no real complaints so far. It installs an \\""erase with Webroot\\"" item in your contextual menu which is quite handy. Haven't checked if it also overwrites the deleted file to make it unrecoverable but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. The only minor thing I noticed is that it crippled a web application I use in IE 10 to submit work I do for my publisher but it isn't a commonly used program and it didn't affect it in Firefox or Chrome.<br /><br />Haven't noticed even a slight hit on system performance."
0,"The price was right, this was a surprise Christmas present for a good friend upgrading from an old XP desktop. I would have given it five stars but there was no support to open any of my friends existing documents created with her older version of WordPerfect,  WP-12,  This new X7 version acts dumb as rocks when you try to open those .wps files and their help file is useless on the topic. Google turned up a fix eventually after a lot of effort was expended searching and reading forums till I was blue in the face. Microsoft Word has a free add-on that will enable MS Word to open up  those .wps files. After opening all her old files one at a time and re-saving them on my laptop, then coping them back and deleting her old ones....... You know, another typical evening on a computer. One would think that a new version of Word Perfect would support older Word Perfect document files, no, It requires Microsoft to do that. Well as they say, &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; Other than that, she feels right at home with the newer WordPerfect X7 version already, so all was worth it."
0,"OK 2015 is due out soon and I am getting soooo nervous! I wonder if QB has read and taken any of the thoughts, recommendations and advise from the ACTUAL users for this release???<br />2013 & 2014 Were the most disappointing releases (except Online (The Cloud) hahaha worst ever)<br />Here's the major issues as I see it:<br />1. Visuals: makes me actually feel angry. That stupid Blue/Black line on the left is obnoxious, never mind USELESS! Yes I know I can change it BUT the average user doesn't!<br />a. The entire world does NOT have wide screen! It may have been easier to just write a Screen Adjust code, just saying.<br />b. The Home screen is the best tool a NEW user can have. The Icons with little lines and arrows... does it get simpler than that OR did QB forget that is the TARGET AUDIENCE???<br />c. Most importantly..... this is a Small BUSINESS software/application not a video game. It needs to be efficient and easy to use and teach. That's it not rocket science!<br />2. Bank Feeds: Really what does that mean? Online Banking OK - Bank Download even better.<br />a. This screen is a DISASTER! Here is a the quick version on how to process (hahahaha)<br />1. Click on - Top Right (no name) wiggly icon, not drop arrow to download ALL Accts<br />- OR if only one acct you can:<br />- Click on Top Right (no name) wiggly icon, select from drop down or on FAR left highlight the account to download then look to FAR right and click &#34;Download transactions&#34; (doesn't say FEED, just saying)<br />2. Now look at all the pretty colors on the Top of the Screen so you can Decode what was just downloaded...............<br />- Orange means you have to research it: (this is the best part)<br />- FAR right &#34;Select&#34; drop down arrow to see options; which will open yet another window that looks a lot like 2012's Apply Transaction screen - make the entry and ok<br />- Your not DONE YET - now you have to<br />1. Go back to the &#34;Select&#34; drop down on the FAR right of each (yes each) line and repeat for all orange<br />***** DO you realize how much time I just wasted and I haven't even gotten to the Blue and Green codes yet..................*****<br />3. My biggest complaints:<br />1. Reports that have not work for several releases; Budgets by client name is one. Was making Pretty Colors more important than a truly functional software?<br />2. The great new features that were added to 2013 & 2014 like: customer screen has tabs for notes, emails, etc... and the &#34;Create Copy&#34; button..... they are hidden because of the cartoonish colors and illogical placement. The most used and necessary buttons are now 3 to 5 clicks away from where they need to be; History for one!<br />3. My question is: is 2013 and 2014 really what QB thought the market was looking for or did they take Microsoft's Windows Vista & 8 wrong turn too. At least Microsoft admits they goofed and are back peddling. All I can do now is pray and wait to see what QB has done with 2015.<br />Lets hope they realize the mess and actually clean it up! I am actively working on a Plan B just in case!ch (yes each) line and repeat for all orange<br />***** DO you realize how much time I just wasted and I haven't even gotten to the Blue and Green codes yet..................*****<br />3.

1,Practice makes my drawing better and this program is fun to use. It also helps to watch the clips on you tube to help understand the functions.
0,"Clearly not as good as previous years, medical entries are too convoluted.  State download is useless because it does not have a category for taxes prepaid to my state.<br />I will not buy Turbo Tax again."
1,Good Free Buy!
1,"I purchased this yesterday after a fiasco with webroot. Norton was easy to install, it does what it says, I have all my devices secured and it is great! Definitely recommend this product."
1,I use this software to keep track of addresses for family. It allows me to print address labels for Christmas and I have found no other that allows that. I have not used it to its full potential but it appears to be a great program!
0,"This is currently the most up to date version of Photoshop available. Unfortunately, the only way to obtain it is to be extorted into a monthly subscription fee. I don't understand why they couldn't make a license copy and a subscription (like Office 365). If you have a previous version of Photoshop the &#34;upgrade&#34; just isn't worth it. Adobe is basically leeching your hard earned cash out of you forever until you realize you're getting ripped off. If you lapse on your subscription you can't even open files until you pony up. Subscription software is just a retarded idea and it seems fairly clear I'm not the only one who thinks this way. Hopefully this opens Adobe's money hungry eyes to what the customers actually want. I currently have CS6 on my computer and plan to stick with this (because CC is barely improved) until they release a CS7. If that doesn't happen I'll switch to a more user-centric photo editor."
1,My wife and I have been purchasing and using H&R Block Deluxe for the past several years.  Very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a simple and accurate way to do their taxes. E-filed both federal and state taxes and accepted on February 8 and tax refunds (both) in my bank account on February18.
0,REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT.  WAS NOTHING WHAT IT USED TO BE.  WISH I NEVER BOUGHT?
0,pop ups are still everywhere.
1,"Works well, downloaded very easily.  I was sorry I had to purchase this program, but as they were canceling my previous one, thought I would try this out.  Seems O.K. so far."
1,it was easy to use to the point. good guidance  steps  and  online help. I liked it a lot . will use it again.
1,Purchase was quick and easy and worked immediately. Downloading was painless; all sections of QB Pro 2014 worked!<br />Thank you again
1,"This product does what it says, but it can take some time to get use to the changes from previous versions."
0,"This program is a piece of junk.  It will slow your computer down, sometimes renders the computers unusable while searching for new photos.<br />I expected more from Adobe.  Again, you get what you pay for.  How in heck am I supposed to by a subscription for something that my camera software can do?  That is what Adobe wants you to do.  To get a yearly subscription to take more of your money."
1,"Easy to use. if you use it like it says, you'll save money and it will pay for itself."
0,"This version has been so reformatted that finding and resetting up settings has been exhausting. The color schemes are too light and finding information about simple tasks has me wanting prior versions.  If it wasn't broke, why fix it!!!!!????"
1,I've been using Avast for several years and have not had any nasty little bugs attack my computer. Once a year registry is time well spent.
1,Good as always.
1,Owned PS 9 and saw that 11 had been released - never much used PS 9 abut PS 11 has a much slicker and easier UI so its getting a workout now.
1,as expected
1,I was down-level from my accountant and had to upgrade.  Amazon had the best price and the download went just fine.  I'm happy.
1,"Very easy to use. I would have missed a major income adjustment for being over 701/2!<br />Much better refund than last year.<br />Easy to use, i'v ben using the product for 7 years."
1,"Love this software and as always, Amazon came through with great service.  Too bad they contribute to the DNC!  I would use them more if they were more A political."
1,"Had it for quite awhile and it seems to work great.  Have had no virus problems with my computer (Dell / Windows XP).  It is currently also working great on my Wife's laptop too (Toshiba / Windows 7).  It does regularly offer you really good deals on the full version, but being retired and on a fixed income, we have had to pass."
1,amazing and its free! still cant believe it
1,"Very easy to use, step by step instructions.  I was a bit scared at first but then I started and it was super easy, and fast. I got my return back in 7 days. And I got a few emails updating me on how the return was going. Very pleased with Turbo Tax."
1,Easy download
1,Easy install.  Have used H&R Block for years.  Very pleased with their product.
1,Currently I don't see much of a change from 2014 to 2015 but will have to look.  It was somewhat difficult to bring over a file from 2012 to the new 2015 took about 20 - 30 min to get it to transfer. Other than that it works great.
1,Easy to download and install.
1,Great Product Fit's My Needs Very Well
1,a terrific product but the download process and subsequent learning curve may be chellenging for inexperienced computer users
1,I needed to upgrade my Quicken program in a hurry and in a matter of minutes my updated program was up and running.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to simplify writing checks and keeping track of where all the money goes !
0,"I have used QuickBooks before and really liked it, so when it came to purchasing it for my home office (we run a small business out of our home,) I didn't think to use anything else. The software download was easy, but the product is not easy to use like the version I have used previously. I feel like you have to click on wayyy too much to get something done. I just didn't like how it was setup. And Intuit customer service was awful, I called five times before someone actually answered the phone. Will not be buying another Intuit product for that reason alone."
1,Works great! I love it! I love that I was able to download it onto my computer and not wait for it to come in the mail.
1,Works fine and is easy to install. Sems to be working seamlesly with the pc and does not seem to be a drag on the performance.
1,"I have used this H&R Block tax software for years after switching over from the more pricey Turbotax. In my opinion it does everything TurboTax does, but at less cost. I have used it for state and federal returns that included business and rental properties in addition to personal taxes. It is very easy to use and can do e-filing as well as print copies for mail filing and also copies in PDF, which I find very handy when reference to a previous year's return is desired. I highly recommend it."
1,Amazing
1,I used McAfee prior to trying this product.  In my opinion this product is far superior.  The messages are clear and the interface is just about invisible.  This program also does not slow my computer down as much as the other.
1,"last year,i used h&r block for tax.this year i try to use turbo tax,but i hard to find if turbo tax has free efile,and the price confuse me.so i decided to use h&r block.it turned out this year h&r block is more easy and friendly.good deal!"
1,"I used to use Turbo Tax, but had problems with it downloading and installing. Went to a CPA and she messed up efiling our tax return - was a big mess because they did not get it in time and we owed fines (which she paid.) So switched to this a couple of years ago and so far am happy with the product. Our taxes are pretty straight forward so this software worked great. It is fairly easy to use and has got me solid refunds. Most importantly it has worked with no problems using efile, so the IRS is not on my back due to late filing.<br /><br />{PROS}<br />. Easy, fast download and install - no problems, took less than 15 minutes total<br />. Easy to use software - walks you through all the steps, asking questions along the way<br />. Imports you forms from last year<br />. Up to date tax laws - has all the current revisions so that I don't have to search myself to understand the yearly changes<br />. Does an error check - found 16 errors where I forgot to fill in some info<br />. Rates it for audit check - found I was low on the possibility of getting an audit. Means nothing I know if the IRS pulls out your name, but will alert you to possible red flags.<br />. Allows you to choose which forms you want to print out<br />. Gives you a status update to let you know if the IRS accepted your efile - gives you a Declaration Control Number as proof that they accepted your return<br />. You get 5 free efiles, nice if you want to share with your family<br />. There is a \\""go to\\"" button which allows you to go to any part of the tax returns, forms or steps<br />. Can import medical, charity, etc from Deduction Pro (online) It lists lots of donated items and the estimated value for each one. You just click on the items, adding them to your deductions. I use this for charity items donated and it works great (have receipts of course.) You can print out the list of donations with all items listed with dates. And it saves it to a file on your computer.<br />. Can compare to last years tax data (if you used this program last year)<br />. You can do a direct deposit, or have them send a check for refunds<br />. There is an amount that shows up in the right top that shows what you owe or are refunded. When you make changes to one area of the tax forms (like medical, charity, etc) it updates the Refund/Owed<br /><br />{CONS}<br />. A Register Product screen pops when I open it but went away when I clicked \\""Don't Register.\\"" Not a big deal at all really, but it is the only thing I can think of that I didn't like. I do not want more emails or junk mail.<br /><br />Conclusion: The software was easy to install/use, I think it got us a sound refund, and there were no glitches with efiling.tax data (if you used this program last year)<br />.

1,"This is the best... It was recommended to me by and friend who is a software engineer that fixed my computer. Runs very well, doesn't effect or slow down my OS. Plus they don't try to sell me anything, it's free and there's no addware."
1,"Easy to use, but be aware that PCmover does not transfer Outlook Rules or Contact lists. An SD card (or other media) must be used to transfer those items. PCmover will not do that for you. Also remember that a new computer means new software licenses. Your data may have transferred, but you might have to pay for them again."
1,ITS EASY TO USE BUT SOMETIMES HARD TO FOLLOW AND IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR TAXES IF THERE WAS A EXPLAINATION IN TERMS THAT US NOT SO SMART PROPLE CAN UNDERSTAND. OTHER THEN THAT ITS BEEN EASY TO USE AND IF YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED BEFORE YOU ITS EVEN EASIER.
1,Download from Amazon electronic distribution site was quick and easy. Software installed without issue and included an update of software and forms.  The application was generally easy to use and the cost was significantly less than its chief competitor.
0,"Very freeze up/crashy, because it will allow you to attempt to use it before being fully downloaded. Don't get the download only version if your internet is slow."
0,"I've used Quicken since 1996 and I just upgraded to 2013 from 2011.  I did the upgrade hoping that their incorrect \\""planning\\"" section would be fixed.  This was not the case.  The planning section still misses random category spending items.  This makes budget planning in Quicken useless.  Back to the spreadsheet."
0,its only for sixty days. thats no good. i thought it would be for a year. i didnt see where it would only be for less days.
0,"Downloaded.  Installed.  Surprised. Incredibly poorly featured.  INTUIT, come on ... it's 2012.  If your Mint.com can take my other online accounts - credit cards, mortgage, banks, 401ks - and blend them together into a cohesive, effortless experience, sure YOU can do the same with QuickBooks.  I'm simply stunned at how little you've put into developing this software.  Here's a tip: spend LESS on marketing your product to suckers like me, and MORE on building features that are innovative, effortless and respectful of the time of your customers.  We're not all white shirts and ties working in florescent offices with plastic spider plants in our cubicles.  Learn something from Mint, will ya?"
1,"I love avast! Of course, there's the &#34;free&#34; part, but I have far fewer problems, both with the program itself as well as the level of protection,  than I had with 4 different paid [some expensive] anti-virus programs. It catches a whole lot more than than my work computer. I'm a teacher, and get documents from hundreds of students... need I say more. Avast comes through every time."
1,I have used TurboTax for years.  I tried other tax software for less money but they did not always work as well. I finally just decided to stick with something that I could trust after I paid my accountant $200 to do my taxes and he gave me my returns printed out with TurboTax.  I figured it would be cheaper to buy TurboTax and do them myself rather than pay someone to put in the numbers I had already prepared.
1,A great product! Does almost everything I need it to do.
1,No problems so far with the software.  Arrived promptly via download. Very helpful resources are available to assist you. Thanks!
1,"Continues to be an excellent tax guide.  We have used it for years now.  It makes filing as easy as our complicated tax law allows.  If we replaced the current law with a flat tax (everyone participates at the same rate without all the loopholes and special interest exceptions) or a federal sales tax (the rich pay more as they buy high-end and luxury items), we could be rid of our current complicated mess."
0,video take forever to convert and turns out grainy and pixelated. Waste of time and money
1,"I use it for unzipping downloaded machine embroidery files...may figure out others uses later; for now, works like a charm."
1,"It what was what i needed, but the pixels on it are bad, and it was slightly expensive. thank you"
1,"When I bought this software I was in a real need for a simple, cheap, and reliable video converter, but there was almost no real helpful information given about this and several other software programs on amazon - but let me tell you, this program really delivered.  I am glad I made the investment and encourage any who need to quickly convert video and audio files to consider this program.<br />This is a great tool to use for converting from one video format to another; and I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can even convert from one video format to an audio format. This third option was great because I have a video clip of Pharrell Williams, which I wanted to have on my ipod to listen to in the car, and believe it or not, this program converted the video and gave me just the pure audio format! I love it!<br /><br />The product description isn't kidding when it says it has a lot of formats to convert between. Though I don't consider myself an expert with computers and audio/video formats, all of the ones I recognize are my choices such as, WMA, WAV, MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC; MPEG 1,2, and MPEG4, MOV, FLV, MKV, AVI, etc... Some other features to mention that are nice about the program is the ability to set it so that it will convert the video/audio files on queue and then either shutdown when it’s complete. This allows me to place several movies on my computer before I go to bed, and then start the PC Video Converter and go to sleep.<br />The installation is pretty straight forward; download time was only a few minutes on my standard Time Warner cable connection. As for installation time, it only took a couple of minutes as well and didn't require a reboot of my computer, (I hate having to do that).<br />The $30 price I paid for the converter is really worth it. Not to mention I can download it from Amazon an unlimited amount of times in the future if need be."
0,It is good but Norton still contacts me to renew an old subscription. They need to update theie information instead of relying automatically on sending messages.
0,Because I have a large number of photos the program did not synch well with my Mac Pro.
1,Well thought out. Provides excellent foundation.
1,The software was easy install and setup and works great without a lot of fiddling. Keeps itself and other software packages updated.
1,Really need it
1,TurboTax is the only way to go.
1,"My original Review had this at 2 stars.<br />I've upgraded it to 5.<br />The reason for the original review was because, although the software is beautiful streamline and pretty much free of crashes, it was rendering all my movies without sound.<br />I finally got connected with Sony support and they resolved the issue:<br />So, for all of you who are experiencing the same thing, here's what you do:<br />Although, I find this setup a little illogical, unlike other programs, this one has the rendering settings to default WITHOUT sound. You have to go into an advanced setting to render with sound.<br />When rendering click the ADVANCED button and choose a format and template (IE Program Stream NTSC Widescreen) and then click the CUSTOMIZE TEMPLATE button. Then click the AUDIO tab. Check INCLUDE AUDIO STREAM.<br />CLICK OK.<br />What I did, was SAVE this setting as a template and now I don't have to worry about it anymore. The SAVE feature is at the top of the Customize Window. (see image I included with review.)<br />About the software:<br />I'm comparing it to Premiere and Pinnacle Studio.<br />My problem with Pinnacle is that they have AWFUL customer service. The software is bloated and crashes in the middle of every project. They have a 14 day window for customer service and , after that, charge you if you need to speak to them. (What???!) Pinnacle used to be a great software program and then they made it overly complex and overloaded with features.<br />Adobe Premiere is very professional and loaded with cool features, but it's got a very unfriendly user interface for the &#34;average Joe&#34; who wants to edit cool looking home movies.<br />SONY's program is very clean looking. The buttons are big and the user interface is not cluttered.<br />You want a transition, click one. ( in Pinnacle it's an Easter-egg hunt every time I need to add an effect... and then it crashes.)<br />The rendering is a bit slower than the other programs, but who cares? As long as it renders right.<br />I'm upgrading to the Movie Studio &#34;Suite&#34; version so I can get the other programs in the bundle and the FX packages.<br />Once I got connected with Customer service, I have to say, I was really impressed. The guy qualified the problem, he looked at a sample file and came back with the answer i needed.ders right.<br />I'm upgrading to the Movie Studio &#34;Suite&#34; version so I can get the other programs in the bundle and the FX packages.<br />Once I got connected with Customer service, I have to say, I was really impressed.

1,"The download was quick.  The program was direct and easy to use.  The review process and e-filing also a snap!  I had purchased the softare, downloaded, installed, updated, inputed my data, reviewed and transmitted within two hours... both state and federal taxes received within 10 days.  Will use Turbo Tax next year, too."
1,I like this latest version as much as the older one I  had. It's easy to use.
1,"I have been using Quicken for many years. It is an amazing program and quite a bargain considering it's power and sophistication. I currently have 10 years of data in it, including multiple mortgages, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, etc. In other words, I work the package pretty hard and have a very large database. I recently upgraded from 2012 to 2013 Premier. In contrast to other reviews, the upgrade went smoothly. In fact, it took about 5 minutes. After I upgraded, I went through my normal weekly routine and everything worked perfectly. I haven't noticed huge changes, but I much prefer the way that mortgages are handled and there seem to be some other nice tweaks. As I read through some of the angry reviews about this package, the contrast with my experience was striking and I asked myself why this package doesn't seem to get the respect I think it deserves? Looking back, I realized that I, too, have had some very nasty upgrade experiences. Why not this time? I think the answer is two fold. First,I upgrade in late February or early March - long enough for Intuit to find and fix any major bugs in the software. While it would be nice to get the new version the day it comes out, I really don't feel the sense of urgency, since the prior version is still working just fine. Things have gone much more smoothly since I adopted this policy. Second, I now upgrade every year. Upgrades are tricky due to the complexities of the data tables and the danger seems to grow exponentially the older the version you are trying to import. Like some of the reviewers I read, I used to try to save money by keeping a version for several years, or until a new feature came out that I couldn't live without. However, these generation skipping upgrades never went perfectly. That changed about 4 years ago when I decided to stop penny pinching in the hope of a better experience. It worked. So, as a veteran user who loves the package but has also suffered through hours of frustration, these aremy two admonitions: upgrade in February or later and upgrade every year. I've now come to enjoy the annual refinements, rather than dread the upgrade process."
0,This software is tedious and buggy.  Switches between english and german without warning.  Very customizable photo collages.  Software starts doing its own thing and images not on storyboard start showing up in the show.  Very slow work speed.  Horrible purchase that I am now stuck with.  Save yourself and go a different direction.  I really wish amazon service clients better or had way to return crap software.
1,"I worked as a seasonal employee for H & R Block for 23 years.  Now that I am retired I buy this program every year to do my own tax return as well as a few family members.  I love all of H & R Block's tax programs.  They are user friendly and of course, if needed, the user has access to a tax professional for answers to questions."
1,"I had been using Microsoft Money Plus (which is outdated and no longer supported) until I upgraded to Windows 10. MS Money no longer functioned after the upgrade, which was disappointing at first, and I figured it was time to transition to new software. I was worried the transition would be painful. Quicken 2015 did an awesome job converting my Money data making the transition easy. I was able to learn to use Quicken very quickly and I discovered many useful features in Quicken that I was missing out on using the old Money software. I am very pleased with Quicken 2015."
0,"I paid for a complete program.  This in not complete. They do not have the proper forms to even finish my Federal return at this time,so it is pending.  They also do not support my home state at all.  I now have to go pay and accountant to do my taxes AFTER I've already purchased this, the additional $50 for a state and the $60 for audit protection."
0,Vastly overpriced
0,"After installing the programme, I kept getting a message that the Programme will expire in a few days and had to replace it with another Norton antivirus programme."
1,Easily downloaded and installed.  Program did all the work to transfer from older product.  Would recommend to others that like to keep tract of their spending.
1,"This is my 2nd year in US and first time doing the taxes myself. With all forms and info in my hands, I was able to go file both Federal and State in less then 3 hours.<br />I initially tried on a old (2007 MacBook Pro 2.16 Core Duo) that I use for most of my tasks, but although it had SnowLeopard (10.6.8)on it, the software did run.  I tried again on my new MacBook Pro (2.4 i5 with 10.7.5) worked like a charm.<br />Thumbs up, very positive experience I recommend!"
0,"Inventory questions let me get well beyond issues that required me to enter values into forms.  Made it work but found it awkward.  Also, a second state cost $39.99, it would have only been slightly more expensive to go to a CPA."
1,excellent
1,Great Service and product
0,"I liked the older versions. This new version is not flexible enough. This review process is not cool. I don't like it at all. In fact, I believe that I will look for another package which would suite my need."
1,I've been using it every year for over a decade. I've always gotten my moneys worth. Never had a problem or audit.
1,I've used this software for several years and it is excellent.  Easy to use and navigate.  Couldnt find my key for my free efiles and customer service was excellent to work with.  I buy one with the state filing and the entire family uses it.  Highly recommend
1,I have used Norton for a long time and avast doesn't seem to slow down my computer as much as Norton.
0,"Well, I downloaded and installed it, updated it to the latest version and I have only been able to record one game. It only records audio in Assetto Corsa and every time I try to use it to record DCS World it crashes the game. I was able to use it to record XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I am very computer savvy and use all types of software every day. I am a Crestron control system programmer by trade. Hope this helps in your decision to buy this software or not."
1,I have had many antivirus programs in the 30 years I've been computing and I like Avast the most of them all.
0,"You might be surprised, but I actually believe Norton 360 Premier edition, which I still have at this moment on 3 machines, is a great total security suite ... That is, unless you are also running Systweak.com's excellent maintenance suite, called Advanced System Optimizer (ASO in short), which I have, and which I prefer to Norton!  I loved the Norton suite until about 6 months ago, when Norton started quarantining an executable file called Advanced System Protector (ASP), part of the ASO suite.  At first, I just downloaded the latest version of ASO and re-installed it. But again Norton snatched ASP, so I learned to get it out of quarantine and set Norton to Exclude it from scans. Norton then started snatching some of the other executable files for other purposes [based upon Heuristic scanning - they all are working files - i.e. they don't stay still as Norton demands!] and quarantined those.  So I got them out of the quarantine and excluded them.  This has carried on getting worse and worse [Norton describes them in quarantine as Gen(eration) 2 Trojans], until today despite that I hit Exclude, nothing happened, and the files went to hell, where Norton had decided they should be!  So, at last I am looking for an equally efficient Security Suite (very difficult to find), but am not prepared to use BitDefender, which is supposedy the #1 security suite, as it is, along with Norton, another Symantec suite: and I'm not about to be nice to a company that will not allow me any say in the matter, whatsoever!  To them, ASO is malware, so I advise you not to use Norton 360 if you have ASO or any other suite that might have equally good, or better (as in case of ASO), abilities to catch non virus-malware.  If you don't get Norton, try ASO to maintain and even rescue your computer if necessary (perhaps in Safe Mode if your computer will not start properly).<br /><br />You might notice that Norton when it caught some of its non-virus malware initially (over a year ago) caught itin 'ASP's Quarantine!'  After that, I *deferred to Norton and stopped running ASP, leaving Norton to do so.<br /><br />*I was more considerate than Norton!"
1,"I love the feature of auto update to your account, it was so easy to get it set up.  I do an auto update it got my beginning balance and all transactions which had been recorded by the bank.."
1,Good product.
1,"Very usefull as always, with much broader understanding of current law than I could hope to have. It is disappointing that so many sections are still pending at this point, but that is not the program, it's the IRS."
0,Free price can't be beat. Had some issues though compared to Norton.
0,I downloaded the product and used the code provided to install.  It will not load; crashes very time.  The response from Amazon was amazingly quick and and I want to be sure that Amazon isn't punished for the review.  Amazon gets a 5!
0,Ridiculously Wackkkk!<br />I paid for the product.<br />Then found out the key is only for going online to fill out my student info....fine<br />did that. Received no email or confirmation of receipt of info or request for more.<br />Got on the phone with amazon (over 1 hour wait) then they told me you have to call<br />adobe another 2 hours on the phone for them to transfer me 3 times! then the agent said<br />I have to do an online chat with a techy....ok then after I gave them all my info (now the 3rd time entered)<br />he said it would be 2-3 days to confirm and then I would get he key...<br />good thing my local deli doen't operate the same way.<br />F@#7 this!!!
1,Very helpful and provided all of the necessary information that I needed.
1,"I have been using Movavi Video Suite for several years now, and I will continue using it for years more. Video Suite is easy to use, intuitive, and powerful. I enjoy being able to drag-and-drop items into it instead of hunting through folders. It's also handy to be able to convert formats with the click of a button - this may be the most useful function for me, personally; it's certainly saved me from a lot of headaches! The video editor is simple and somewhat basic, but it gets the job done just fine for my needs. Overall, it's an excellent product and worth the money. I highly recommend it."
1,So far works seamlessly and the price can't be beat.  Definitely try this before buying more expensive software.
0,Just Hate Microsoft's products but it does do what is says
1,"Contrary to many of the negative reviews, I had no problem upgrading from my 2011 version.  It was a smooth installation and everything worked great.  I like some of the new account summary functions and the credit check/monitoring function."
0,"I have used many dozens of software programs, from office products to engineering applications to software development tools. I'd be hard pressed to think of one that I dislike more than this one. The user interface is remarkably poorly designed for a mature product such as this. I was constantly confused by its organization and annoyed by its lack of obviously necessary features.    I am a former TurboTax user who was satisfied with the product but not with its publisher Intuit due to their anti-consumer policies, e.g. lobbying to prevent the simplification of tax forms so that tax software would be less necessary, and crippling their Quicken products after 3 years of use. So I decided to try H&R block. I really *wanted* to like this software, but to my disappointment this is what I found:    1. Can't use mouse wheel to scroll a form until first clicking on an editable field (clicking elsewhere on the page does not permit scrolling). If you switch to another windows program and then back to H&R Block, you must again find an editable field to click on in order to scroll.    2. When some forms are opened, the focus is initially on drop-down box. If one tries to scroll, then the value of the drop-down changes, possibly without the user even noticing. Compounding this issues -- there is no undo feature, so even if you realize that you changed the value, you might not know what the old value was.    3.  After entering a list for a value box, that list cannot be directly edited again by clicking on the same value box. The only option is to right-click and select Open Itemized List which presents a menu of all lists that you have created on all forms. The current list item (the one that brought you here) isn't selected by default, so it is necessary to search though the list of list names to find the one you want. In addition, some list names default to a common name (such as when there are multiple copies of a form), so you can have many lists shown with the same name and no way to find the one you want other than by trial and error. Adding an \\""Edit this list\\"" option to the context menu would greatly improve usability.    4. When viewing the Forms window (which inexplicably opens a different window, even though you can also edit the form in the normal Interview-style window), that window is modal and therefore nothing in the main window, e.g. the Save button, can be clicked.    5. Some changes are irreversible and without occur warning, e.g. attempting to temporarily select the \\""Claim the home office safe harbor deduction\\"" on Form 8829 will delete all entries and lists that become irrelevant when that box is checked. Clearing that checkbox does not restore the deleted values and lists.    6. Colors: It seems to have been designed primary for people who are color blind as the forms are displayed with no colors. Values that are calculated are shown as black text on dark grey backgrounds which I found difficult to read. Tentative values are shown with an easily unnoticed asterisk (rather than an alternate color), and the values derived from the tentative value are not marked at all (unlike Turbo Tax which clearly colors red all tentative values and the values derived from them).    7. If the Windows toolbar is located on the left side of the screen, then HR Block windows repeatedly open under the toolbar (partially or totally obscured), even after they have been moved, closed and re-opened.    8. Form 1095-A: Box 2: The field is not large enough to hold the required value for a CA Health Exchange policy number.    9. Form 1095-A Interview: There is a single box provided for each person for \\""Start Date/End Date\\"". The box accepts only a single date.    10. When there are multiple copies of forms, e.g. several 1099-INT forms, and you try to trace a value to one of those forms using the Jump To Related feature, you are presented with a list of items designated \\""Copy 1\\"", \\""Copy 2\\"", etc. First, the program should simply take you to the correct copy. Secondly, if it really had to give you a list of options, they should be more descriptive (such as include the Payee name) so that it does not require a trial and error process to find the form that you want.    11. Importing from TurboTax: Basic information, e.g. name, address, capital loss carryover, imported correctly. Other items, e.g. Section 179 carryover, Schedule C loss carryover, and state estimated tax payments, were not imported. Worst of all â\\"" the Federal estimated tax payments were populated with the values of the state estimated tax payments! OMG! Really? Check your previous year's return carefully for carryovers and prior payment values.    12. PDF Generation: Program crashed while creating a PDF file (although the file was created). Unfortunately the PDFs have no table of contents as they do with TurboTax, a feature that I find very useful.    13. If you are editing a form, the only way to open a new form (other than those available in the Recently Used window) is to close the form and return to the Interview window where you can once again select Forms, open the desired form, and [sigh] once again open the Recently Used window. Then you can once again resize and reposition both of those windows. Yes, this procedure is required every time you open a new form. As I said in the title, a shockingly poor user interface.    I did find one redeeming feature in H&R Block -- the Recent Forms List. This is very useful for bouncing back and forth between forms, and I prefer this to TurboTax's tabbed window approach.  It would be better if it were integrated as a panel in the main window instead of a separate window which must be re-opened and resized/repositioned every time the Forms window is opened.    I gave H&R block two stars rather than one because it ultimately allowed me to enter my data and, as far as I can tell, performed the calculations correctly.    I also evaluated TaxAct and found the user interface to be vastly superior to H&R Block's. See my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWT0UA2UBEJ8/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6SNK8W    My advice to H&R Block: Fire your software manager. He is not good at his job."
1,I have used Avast for probably 10 years and have never had a problem. It works very well and I would highly recommend it. And the price is right.
0,Turbo Tax should fire the 'nut' that took away the forms that were included in ALL the past years BUT not in the 2014 &#34;Deluxe&#34;.  I feel like I have been robbed by the people in charge of Turbo Tax.  H & R Block will give you the missing forms for free if you prove to them that you bought this INFERIOR tax program.  Watch for Turbo Tax to lose a lot of people next year and for H & R Block to get rich.
1,Excellent deal from Amazon and a good trusted product. Highly recommended it.
0,"It supposes to be 3 PCS, but the key allows me to download only one PC."
1,"Tried most all internet securities over the years and Avast is the best. Affordable and easy to use, Love It."
0,"Compared to Word on Windows, there is a particular issue with line numbering in complex documents where line numbering is used extensively but selectively. You need to do a print preview to identify line numbers that are being undesirably printed (but not shown as such during normal editing), and then go back and suppress them using the paragraph dialog.<br /><br />I haven't figured out exactly what is going on, but related to section breaks, the Mac version seemingly inconsistently prints to PDF as multiple files, that you then must reassemble in some other PDF app.<br /><br />(Update: Supposedly the Service Pack 2 (SP2) 14.2.1 updater released on 4/25/12 fixes the eSATA/Thunderbolt Activation problem discussed in the following.) While I have personally not been bitten by this yet, this product uses \\""Activation\\"" that is apparently incompatible with the use of attached eSATA (or Thunderbolt, I believe) drives. More particularly, apparently changes in your external eSATA drive configuration are viewed by the Activation process as a move to a different machine.  Apparently general use of USB external drives doesn't have this problem, however use after booting from a cloned backup can also land you in trouble with Activation.  See the  discussion of this in Digital Lloyd's Mac Performance Guide news blog, postings on Friday, May 11, 2012, and Monday, July 09, 2012. And/or search the Office for Mac support site for \\""eSATA\\"".<br /><br />I purchased this as an Amazon download and that process worked just fine.  I wish more software was available this way.  I did find it odd how widely the price swung (up and down by $50) in the few months I was tracking this download version of the product.  I wish Amazon provided some form of price tracking, but there are others that fill the void.<br /><br />Best wishes"
1,"This software works fine on my computer with Windows 7. However, I encountered a problem last night when I was trying to update the software. After the installation on the update, I restarted the program, it then freezed with a status bar saying &#34;...check the notifications.&#34; I spent about an hour to figure out what was going on. I uninstalled the software and then installed it again to see if the problem was gone, but it did not. I finally figured out that it was due to my zonealarm which blocked the HR from accessing the internet.  This is strange, because the HR tax worked prior to the update. Also, when the updated software freezes up, no pop up from zonealarm is seen to ask me if HR tax is allowed to get access to the internet. I guess that the updating messed up on some settings.<br />If you got the same problem, I suggest you to disable the zonealarm first. You then open the updated tax software. After that, start zonealarm."
0,"After a decade of being a loyal TurboTax fan it is time for me to abandon it. The so-called &#34;deluxe&#34; version of TurboTax no longer includes the simple ability to do a Schedule D and they expect me to fork over 40 to 50% more money just to have it. Ridiculous. I have checked the capability of some competing tax software, notably H&R Block, and you have this capability at a much better price point. From what I see the reviews aren't bad either, plus you can transfer your previous turbotax history over relatively easily. Goodbye TurboTax."
0,"this was my worst decision ever, if I could rate it zero stars I would. Although my system met the requirements, it would not even start the download, have contacted someone that I work with and he will try to install, but I have to pay him, so now it has cost me more than if I had gone to WalMart and purchased. Have not been able to find any support through Amazon and really has changed my opinion on Amazon where I have made many purchases...<br /><br />Would be nice for Amazon to offer support for this, but they don't seem to.<br /><br />My suggestion, X out of this purchase and drive to walmart for this product for 89.00"
1,i love avast its the best on the market i recommend it to all my family and friends i will use nothing else
1,Easy to use.
1,This was a GREAT price for this software
1,Thanks It's perfect
1,It was a great price o what can be so expensive. I am very satisfied; it works an removes any threats received..
0,"My first customer service call to Intuit was to somebody who was knowedgeable, clear, and helpful.  That was my last positive experience.  Two later calls were handled by people I could barely understand, who repeated my question three times but never answered it.  They also gave some clearly wrong information.    Then my on-line banking stopped working properly ... one financial institution (my new bank) wouldn't show up.  My company file had to go to the Intuit data services team.  They promised I would get a call on Monday, and the file on Tuesday.  There was no call Monday, no file Tuesday.  Finally, after about a dozen calls, I managed to get the file Wednesday late afternoon -- but needed more calls to retrieve a pin and a password.      If that were the end of it I might have given more than one star.  But my file was again corrupt -- although an on-line technician was able to fix it -- or so it seemed.  On-line banking was not working correctly, and I ended up having to spend hours removing duplicate entries that had been downloaded from my credit card companies.  This should never have happened.    Yes, Quickbooks is powerful, but it's a flaky product with an often confusing interface.  Support policies are aweful.  The technician who fixed my customer file the second time said that he might have to send it back to data services, with another 48 hour wait.  And when I asked if that was the best they could do after what I'd been through, he said that they are an elite group, and are very busy.      So ... if you don't mind a somewhat confusing product, aweful support policies, the possibility of some data corruption, and the evident need to keep paying for such poor support ... go ahead and buy this product.  I wish there were a good alternative out there.    I'm a consultant on usability and service design.  The best I can say about Quickbooks Pro 2011 is that I've found a wonderful candidate for my services -- although I'd be surprised if they hire American consultants."
1,"I migrated from Aperture and Lightroom 4 is immensely better.  Faster, more useful, but mainly way, way faster.  Don't stay with aperture anymore.  Make the switch."
0,"I have used Quicken for many, many years, first for Windows, and then for Mac.  First, the Mac version has never come up to the Windows version, and now, with the latest version, I've had the program crash on me 4 or 5 times when I try to manually match transactions.  These are my finances we're talking about and I would freak out if I didn't have access.  Other than that, it works OK."
1,"the only improvement that I would subject is when errors are found after the system check, they should have a link to where it is in the process to make the change or be able to change it within the check"
1,"Blocks so many harmful stuff, offers you a variety of over 9,000 security. Overall, a great choice with no price at all."
0,"I thought that when I purchased HR Block + State, it included one free state file.  It is just including one state program, for which they would charge if not purchased together.  Filing State is an additional charge.  I like the TurboTax program better; but tried this one because of the price.  It DID do my taxes properly without too much fuss."
1,Have been using Avast for a couple years and have been pleased with their free antivirus.  Works in the background without taking up too much processor speed.
1,Expected plug and play - had to contact company for a code to register the software.  The code was provided quickly.
0,"I have followed all of the steps presented on this paper multiple times. Installed, Uninstall, reboot, ad-nauseum. Every time when I convert to Q2014, I end with approximately 300 or more transactions were the Category is missing. I guess I will wait for whatever next patch Quicken comes up with before trying this again.<br /><br />I would like to know if there is a possibility of getting my money back."
1,Great game/screen capture software. Had some problems getting it to work at first. But customer service had it fixed in about 30 mins. I would definitely say that this product is well worth the money.
1,"The download was fast and the installation couldn't be any easier.This is an excellent software for tax preparation, especially if you own and rent out your property.  However, and as good as this software is, I had to manually enter some numbers and information directly on some of the form. I am not sure why the software wouldn't complete the information automatically but at least it leads to where the hiccup is located.<br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results!"
1,Perfect.  No need to overpay elsewhere for your mcafee.  Just download the code and you can continue your protection on the cheap.
1,worked good.
1,Works fine for me.
1,worked just like i wanted - no issues with install at all.  just need to connect to my android phone now.
1,"I have used other antivirus software, some were free others I paid for and this one meets and exceeds the performance of any of the others.no need to upgrade this basic product is multi functional."
1,So easy and great! Downloaded know problem and using Word & Excel the same day!! Just what I was looking for!!
1,"The RAITING system is suppose to be on the products people...NOT Amazon or download speeds.<br /><br />Me giving it 5 stars for how fast it downloaded is as fair as the &#34;one&#34; stars given for how slow it downloaded for others.<br />It took me 5mins to download with no problem.  Connection issues to system specs are just a small number of user end issues that could happen, but not the products fault.<br /><br />How did those that had long download issues determine that somehow its the products fault?  It's like being mad at an apple falling off a tree slower than an orange and you getting mad at the apple.<br /><br />Can those that gave one stars share with us their process of troubleshooting and proof that the software caused the slow downloads?  It is only 3GB?<br /><br />Even if it was not user end issue...it could be Amazon's fault, or you internet companies fault...again not products fault."
0,i first tried the trial version worked exccelent purchased full version slow as you know what nothing as promised i doesn't even have the burner like the free version i don't reccomend it
1,"I have been using TurboTax since the 90s. It has gotten increasingly better, more complete, and easier to use every year."
1,"Have been using H&R Block Tax sftware for over 10 years.  Started out as Taxcut.  Always been easy to use and walks you through preparing your return.  THis year, Deduction Pro, which is great for figuring out your deductions was on-line and it still imports directly into H&R Block software.  Your federal return is ported directly to your state return and you only have to answer a few more questions to complete your Statew return.  Would like to see them bundle the state e-file into the package."
1,As great as TurboTax is.  No need to hire a pro to take your tax. It make tax-preparation pretty simple.
0,This worked great until a certain point and then stopped working due to software issues. It did help me learn to type to a certain point.
0,"It's not bad, but still can lead you astray if you are not careful. It's got a few bugs, such as being unable to delete form you don't need (I don't run a farm, for example, but I can't delete the farm form). Also, not as user-friendly as before. For example, why do you have to enter &#34;2013&#34; for every charitable gift? This is for 2013 return, right, so what other year would it be?"
1,I had some problems with the download but I got that straightened out. The program is just what I expected it to be. I have used Corel before and like it. It is an inexpensive alternative to Photoshop that is user friendly. I would recommend Paint Shop Pro to anyone that works with photos that doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars for a program that is not that much better.
0,"I would give this product a &#34;zero&#34; if possible. I have used TurboTax for at least for at least 20 years using the Deluxe version.  This year I am getting raped by the wonderful company Intuit, we I now need to purchase the Premier version to complete the schedule D form.  Well, this is the last year i will ever use this product because of this sleezy trick to gain revenue.  You were already more expensive than your competition, but I did like your interface a little better.  You have just lost another long term loyal customer."
0,Clearly the poorest-quality release of what used to be a useful product. It took me hours to get the screens back to a useable format and many of the functions are hidden so well I still have not been able to find them. On-line communications with accounts are buggy at best (refuses to update the online balance for several without making multiple contact; had to completely reset two accounts; still can't get a bank with multiple accounts to work correctly).
0,The program does exactly what I wanted it for However it crashes quite often to the point were it is annoying. You can not return it
1,Works well most of the time.
1,You can count on quicken to do what you need done. Accounting requirements only let you do so much. Quicken takes care of them and then makes changes to the interface to make things look better.
0,"Every time Quicken adds &#34;new and improved&#34; features, others either disappear or don't work as well as they used to. This product was MUCH better about two iterations ago, and they should have left it &#34;as is.&#34;  However, in order to get any kind of assistance from Tech Support, you have to keep upgrading, as they stop supporting older versions seemingly more quickly--so I guess it'll be time to upgrade to '16 or '17 in the next 12 months...."
1,"I am a happy customer, have been well protected with Avast! I recommend their free service.They update at least daily!"
1,"I love my older Garmin GPS with a CRT rather than the flat screen LCD. It's best advantage is that it can easily be seen in the glaring sun, while the LCDs need a visor, and sometimes, even with the visor, they can't be seen. So I continue to use the older StreetPilot model. But I do need to keep the maps up to date, and the Lifetime Map Update is perfect for that. Updates are 4 times a year. the only problem is that the updates take hours and hours, but I do them overnight while sleeping."
1,Love this app.
0,"This seems like a perfectly fine piece of budgeting software, but it does not live update with mobile app, and just doesn't work with for me.  The customer service seems fine, the software seemed fully equipped, but I just didn't enjoy using it.  I found that I actually did much worse with watching my cash flow and budgeting than I had with my previous software, just because I didn't find the software suited me.  I was disappointed, but I wouldn't talk anyone out of using it.  I just prefer a much simpler excel style budgeting tool."
0,"I expect H&R Block to know the ins and outs of the convoluted US tax code but I guess I expect too much.  This software didn't accurately compute the adoption tax credit and naturally that draws the attention of the IRS, which is almost as incompetent.  I wouldn't recommend this software if you have anything unusual like an international adoption spanning many years.<br /><br />I\\""m switching to Turbo Tax because I have zero confidence in H&R Block.  BTW, if you\\""re tired of trying to figure out our convoluted tax code or paying tax preparers outrageous sums of money, please check out www.fairtax.org, it makes a lot of sense.  It will make April 15 what it should be, just another day of the year (without any drama)."
1,less expensive than anything else that i could find. download feature was great and convenient. would recommend to anyone looking to quickly product
1,"I haven't found a better way to do my taxes. This program seems to have everything I need to get the job done. I like the way it guides me through the process. Fairly easy interface, and seems to do the job."
1,I have used TurboTax for over 10 years now and have always found it to be a superlative product.  It's easy to use and there is support available both online and over the phone.
1,I have used avast for many years and it has blocked many trojans and viruses. I would recommend it highly.
0,the output wasnt that great. The video quality was OK but voice was too low
1,"Premiere Elelements is good, probably the best within the non-professional video editors.<br />But there's something wrong with its stability - even a relatively short film with titles and effects makes my it stall! I need to set off all programs and save frequently - very frequently!"
0,"Love the product and have used it for years.  If you have ANY problem though, getting to someone who speaks English and knows anything is next to impossible.  I have been trying to get an answer to a problem for the past 5 years and have yet to get anyone who knows how to fix what used to work perfectly.<br /><br />Better know what you are doing because you won't get any useful help.  Their phone number is under tighter security than the gold at Fort Knox!"
0,"I just paid $40 to have Staples remove over 200 cases of adware off of my computer!  I did not have any issues prior to downloading AVAST, but after downloading it I couldn't even access the internet without constantly being redirected to different sites and having pop ups!  I cannot recommend this program.  Spend the $20 bucks and get AVG or $30 bucks and get Norton... It protects you better and costs less than having someone remove viruses or adware from your computer!<br /> (This &#34;free&#34; antivirus cost me $40 to remove the viruses and then $20 to get AVG and actually have coverage.)"
1,"Clear instructions, worked as advertised, no problems. Migrating everything to a new PC or OS can be a nightmare; this software made it pretty easy and simple. Definitely worth the discounted price, and having used it for a successful migration of important data and settings I'd probably pay the full price if I faced the same situation again."
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax for 10 years.  Refunds have been decent.  This year the refund was the best ever - substantially more than last year!  Simple to use, Turbo Tax asks simple questions and gets the biggest refunds!! Great!!"
0,It was hard to download and I'm not sure it really working.
1,"the turbo tax deluxe was very easy to use, and answered all my questions, helping me get the maximum refund.<br />however there was a question that arose about a life insurance payment that it didn't answer correctly, so I had to check with my investment advisor,"
1,"I have always chosen Norton 360 for my PC because it includes antivirus, internet security, and backup at an affordable price. I have never been let down once in its service."
1,"WORKS WELL WITH WINDOWS 7.  DOES NOT INSTALL TO THE NORMAL USE AND PDF FORMAT OPTIONS ON MY WINDOWS EIGHT DESKTOP.  I GOT IT FOR FORMATTING PURPOSES FOR PHOTOS FILES AND WORK FILES.  IT STILL DOES THAT, JUST NOT AS EASY A SAVE OPTION AFTER FORMATTING ON THE WINDOWS 8 INSTALL.  IT WANTS TO DROP EVERYTHING THROUGH CLOUD WORD PROCESSING.  ITS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.  I USE WINDOWS 7 FOR MOST MY COMPUTERS AS THEY ARE HOME OFFICE.  SO ITS GOOD FOR THE PRICE AND DOES WORK FOR MOST THE PART."
1,Does exactly as expected and the price - free - is righteous. Very happy with this product and recommend it highly.
1,Great product!
0,The Activation Code that comes with the CD does not work does not work.
1,Turbo tax is so convenient to use each year because it transfers last years needed information and then walks me through each item of possible income and deductions. Very easy to use and then it is electronically filed.
1,"I bought this program because Quicken just changed their format, so I should be able to roll over the files for the next several years. Great program to track all my finances."
1,"I purchase iBank 4 when I upgraded to Lion on my MacBook Pro.  I needed a simple to use financial product that would track activity in a personal account, small business account and then also a non profit group.  iBank does all these things beautifully.  The interface is easy to manage.  Best feature for me personally, is the ability to print checks.  iBank allows me to set up the checks exactly as I need them to print on the computer checks sent to me from my bank.  Believe it or not, Quicken 2007 never gave me this option.  So far, I am VERY pleased with this product and see myself not only sticking with it, but advising it to my friends."
0,"Downloaded the product thinking I'd actually be able to use it.  Wouldn't open and tech support tells me 48hrs.  DO NOT BUY.  Leads to nothing but frustration.  When they actually have some sort of tech support and a product that works I'll change my score.  Until then, run."
1,Turbo tax is the easiest and the fastest way to get your return ! It has great features and support if you need it.
1,"Would like the flexibility to purchase for less than 5 devices, but a great trusted product."
1,"Love the software when its problem free.  Had to pull teeth to get a no answer to a mistake I made, the answer was dodged by support misdirecting me.  I used an archive copy it was all I had.  So my current file will forever have the label of Archive. I'm not mad, my computer crashed, you take what you can get."
0,First off my main computer is a mac. Secondly on my lanova the document won't download well enough for me to print just even one page. I feel well i know i just wasted 20 dollars. I'm spending more time now to make a few by hand. So frustrating. :(
0,Unable to download on a new Dell computer.
0,"I was referred to avast by company who assembled my computer. I followed their recommendations, however I find your service confusing. You seem to always be asking more services for which you need more $$. Not sure I got what I need to secure  my computer."
1,"So after numerous attempts and many programs later to get this computer Novice's PC running right...here come Norton 360. My PC, my wife's PC and my son's all run so much better and more efficient compared to before with all the background garbage running. I may not be able to actually meet and destroy the person(s) responsible for invading my life with pc viruses, malware, spyware and all other hacker games they play...thats ok cause I now have Norton 360 and I am finally able to compute in peace. Thanks  PS: also saved a few buck by downloading the software.    Cons: As far as I know it was like any other program, it requires a minute of your time so it can get running the way you want it to (not really a bad thing, just takes some time)."
0,"First there was the version fiasco, where you had to buy a more expensive version to do the same things you did last year. Then there was the fraudulent state returns fiasco, where several states refused to accept TurboTax generated state returns.....<br /><br />In my case, the NJ State tax is extremely buggy. For example, TurboTax seems to insist that my 17 year old daughter who worked at camp last summer has a &#34;business&#34;. It is forcing me to fill out the name of her &#34;business&#34; and the income of her &#34;business&#34;. Rest assured, I have not entered ANY business information on any of her taxes. TurboTax will not let me file her extremely simple NJ return without her &#34;business&#34; information.<br /><br />In my case, I had some stock option losses and I recorded them into TurboTax exactly as my broker recorded them on my tax forms. In case of the Federal return, all was well. However, on the NJ State form, TurboTax insisted there must be an error because the number &#34;cannot be less than zero&#34;.<br /><br />One would think they can just override the problem on the NJ State form. Guess again!  Before TurboTax will allow you to e-file, they do &#34;a final check&#34; which sends you into a loop of seeing the &#34;cannot be less than zero&#34; error all over again. So now I have to file my NJ State tax on paper, even though Intuit already collected the fee for filing my state taxes.<br /><br />Oh, if you think you are going to get support from Intuit to maybe correct the buggy NJ State return, sorry. When you click on &#34;Help&#34; in the program, you are sent to a TurboTax web page were you can type your question. Supposedly, they have a knowledge base but it never seems to find any answers for me. You can post a question in the TurboTax forum where your question MAY be answered by a TurboTax employee or maybe another user. If you want to email them or open a problem ticket, there doesn't seem to be any way to do that. The only other alternative is to speak to a representative, which is currently a 30 minute wait time (I'm assuming that estimate is optimistic). I have better things to do with my time, and I'm sure you do as well.<br /><br />On the TurboTax feedback form, I told them their entire management team should be walked out of the building, starting at the top."
0,don't like all the different versions.  not as easy to use as in the past.  use to be such a deal.  not so much now
1,Worked just as promised.  Great price!  Hope they offer this deal next year.  I will purchase it again!
0,I've been unable to install.  I get a message saying I have a 64 bit system and the software will only install on a 32 bit system.  I was never give the option to download a 32 or 64 bit version.  I called and was given the option to have a representative call me within 5 minutes.  I'm still waiting.  It's been a week or more.
0,"I had to puchase Premier ,Turbo Tax to be able to accept K-1 information from LLC's, Partnerships, and S-Corps.  I could not not get a definitive answer from Turbo Tax before I bought the Deluxe.  I telephoned and still had a problem as to how much Premier would handke the K-1 information.  I cannot track&#34; basis&#34; automatically."
0,Wow.  Got on line today to purchase my TRUSTED TT and was blown away by all the bad reviews and the sneaky way Intuit down graded the Deluxe version to ensure I had to buy the Premier version.  &#34;Ensure&#34; was a bad choice of words because I will NOT be buying TT this year for the first time in a LONG time.  I guess I am a new H&R Block customer.  Goodbye Intuit.
1,Easy to follow program that was able find more deductions then I had remembered.  Tax laws change so much that if you are doing taxes yourself - has the updates there and the link to research the subject from the IRS site - if you need it.
0,"I am very disappointed in Amazon. I was planning to make this my primary cloud storage because of the unlimited capacity. However, I did the 3 month free trial and now notice that the sync application no longer works and the have this new garbage. You have 90 days to fix this or I will not be paying to keep unlimited storage or my music storage. Ill keep my Prime free photo storage and keep using Google Drive and One Drive. They may offer less space but at least they mount a drive and sync it!"
0,"most useless piece of software i have purchased till date. slowed down all my 3 PC's and i end up restarting them,  ALL THE TIME. Go for norton security. this is worthless.... !"
0,"I don’t fault Intuit for trying to get more money for their products. Every company strives for that. What I do fault them for is (1) the size of the effective price increase (double, seriously?) with no improved value proposition (2) that they believe we’re too dumb or too wealthy to care, and (3) for lying to our faces about why it was done. The VP repeatedly states on here it was not a money grab but was a “difficult decision done to align the products.” Well, the online Deluxe version had been aligned with the Deluxe packaged version every year until last year, when the Sched D was first removed from the online Deluxe product. I know this because I was a longtime user who was an unlucky discoverer of the schedules quietly being removed last year after many hours invested in my online Deluxe return. So the products were deliberately misaligned by TT last year, and now they are claiming that Sched D must be removed from the packaged version “for the sake of alignment”. Well, that explanation is disingenuous at best, and dishonest at worst.<br /><br />Like others, I don’t like the arrogance and lies coming from Intuit and will be voting with my wallet this year over to a competing product."
1,I bought the Movavi video converter a couple years ago in order to convert video I downloaded into a format that I could record onto DVD disc and play on my DVD player. This product did the job beautifully and in fact I'm using it right now on another computer. I should mention my version is an older one so the new version is probably even better!!
0,This has to be among the worst purchase experiences I have suffered through for software.  Install process is error prone and opaque so when something is wrong you have no idea what to try and remedy.  What a complete waste of time and money
1,"So excited to use Manga Studio!  I purchased the software to help in the production of my web comic.  It has so much more than I had anticipated!  It has templates with prefabricated comic panels, prefabricated thought and dialogue bubbles...it really is fantastic!  Super duper excited!"
1,"I skipped the 2010 version, so am enjoying the good updates from the 2007 version.  Use it often for newsletters and certificates."
1,"Quick, easy and simple! Even better when you have used it before.  Your information just auto-populates without tying same information.  Biggest thing, you save money."
1,"I have used TurboTax every year since I was an employee back in 2008. I've been self employed, owned a home, exercised stock options - all kinds of different scenarios - over the years. I love how it saves my info from the previous year and asks simple questions to ensure I get it right.<br />I recommend it highly (and promise I don't own any intuit stock :)!"
1,Same as every other year.
1,"Norton Security does everything I need. Which doesn't include backup. Great interface. Updates very quickly. After many years of use, no virus or malware has gotten through.  One thing I wish it would do is stop semi-malware like Spigot. For that I have to run Malwarebytes."
1,"I've stayed with Norton for years. Does the job, easy to install, and doesn't update every 3 minutes like other anti-virus apps."
0,Made my laptop slow and crash
0,"Encountered two issues, and reported these to H&R Block.  One had to do with importing last year's North Carolina state tax data - somehow it imported the 2011 state income tax amount instead of 2012.  There was also a bug in the North Carolina state program in calculating the NC consumer use tax - the lists of items I entered repeatedly disappeared after I entered them, so I calculated totals by hand as a workaround and just entered the totals."
1,I have used Quicken Home & Business for many years.  It satisfies my needs for financial management and makes tax time a breeze.  Needed a copy to install on my laptop when my desktop crashed.  The price on Amazon for the download was great and downloaded quickly.
1,Easy to use.
0,"It suits my needs, but I can understand others' complaints. Selling the same item as in 2013, but with fewer features at the same price is a poor choice on their part."
0,the product works great but would only down load on one computer repeated attempts to get Microsoft to fix problem has met with no response what so ever Bill Gates shame on you ! that's pretty lame
0,"I have been using H&R Block for a number of years and have enjoyed how easy it has been to use their software.  However, this year's version also contains a backdoor virus which was detected and removed by Microsoft Security Essentials.  After e-filing my tax return, I deleted their program.<br /><br />I lost my confidence with H&R Block and they have lost me as a customer.  Also, Amazon needs to stop selling this software until this virus has been removed."
1,"Works flawlessly. Program wants to delete some Firefox add-ons it says are problems, but they are not problems for me, so I don't follow Avast's advice. Otherwise, this is an excellent (and free) program that I would highly recommend. I have not had any virus infections."
0,"I did not like it at all.  I was hoping it would be better than Quicken, but was sadly mistaken, and was disappointed that I couldn't get my money back."
1,"Everything is as simple as a drop down menu! Allocate your expenses, time, payroll & more! I can't suggest it enough! Thank you quickbooks!"
0,"Extremely Disappointed! Not worth a single penny! I've owned one version or another since I bought my first computer 24 years ago. The last version was PrintMaster Platinum 17. Unfortunately, like everyone else, I had problems with it because of Windows 8.1. No conversion! NO ADDRESS BOOK in this version. They have labels but no address book! What is the sense in that!!! I'm going to re-type 480 names and addresses?! The one and only good thing is they do install independently. I wish I could get my money back but not sure if I can on a download!"
1,It is a very easy-in-use tool that effectively protects your PC. I recommend it to others who still think about buying one.
1,Love the new Office features like SkyDrive integration.  Visio has always been good but this version is very slick.  Recommend it!
0,"I'm the first to say I love TurboTax and have used it for 15+ years, but this year's software has clearly failed me. My download and install appeared to go fine. Upon starting TurboTax, my system reports that the program has stopped responding. I don't have the time to troubleshoot this issue for days and weeks on end. When I purchase software, I have a reasonable expectation that it runs as long as my system meets the requirements.<br /><br />I read the comments and the VP of TurboTax is very good at deflecting the point here. I downloaded YOUR software which doesn't work on my system that is up to date (Win 8.1 i7, 8gb ram, MS .net 4.5.1, etc). That's a software release problem and now is turning into a customer service problem by deflecting the blame.<br /><br />My computer is not out of date nor is Microsoft's .net framework out of date.<br /><br />I'm open to suggestions on how to clear this issue up."
1,"H&R Block tax software is cheaper than the TurboTax that I have used since 2002, it recognizes my TurboTax returns, and it is easy to follow."
1,"I have been using Avast! since last 8 years, and have never thought of going back to anything else. Free version is good enough for most average users like myself."
0,"Finally having to switch to Intuit Quicken from Microsoft Money about a year ago, I have been feeling the pain since.  This software is terrible and I find myself having to copy/paste transactions so Quicken will recognize them when I am balancing my accounts.  It is not very intuitive or friendly to traverse through accounts, move records from one account to another, balance accounts, view downloaded transactions and a number of other frustrating things.  I haven't even touched my 401k accounts with Quicken considering how poorly it handles regular bank accounts.  I curse this product probably 90% of the times I use it and so wish MS Money would come back.  It was such a great product that I didn't realize how much until I converted everything to Quicken.<br /><br />Try to find another product before buying this one.  It should be your last resort.  The main reason I did was to download bank transactions and most banks only \\""support\\"" Quicken.  Hopefully there is a better solution out there that I am just missing."
0,"I'm not a computer guru, but I'm not a computer idiot either.  I'm somewhere in the middle.  When it comes to buying software, I do admit things can get a little confusing for me and so I rely on my boyfriend's computer programming expertise to help me.  His input on this buy was minimal so it is possible that I chose the wrong package.  I will start with the negative and end on a positive.  My computer had the Windows Word Starter software on it.  All the documents that I created in the Starter program had issues once I upgraded to this.  I'm not sure if it was a computer issue or a software/program issue but once this was installed, the documents I had previously created in Starter had to be &#34;reconfigured&#34; into this one.  Every time I opened those documents for editing (I'm a writer) my computer kept automatically generating templates of the original Starter ones.  The documents would auto-open in this program but when I would go to exit out of them an additional file would try to be created and I would have to jump through hoops to get the &#34;Warning you have not saved this template...&#34; messages off my screen.  Eventually it became so annoying that I had my boyfriend look at it and he did something that only took fifteen minutes and it has since stopped...so, for all of you out there that can translate what I just explained, there ya go...that's the ONLY negative. :)<br />The positives are much more...has everything it says it does.  Downloading was a breeze.  Instructions were clearly marked and easy to understand.  The key number was easy to find (thanks to Amazon if you buy it directly from here and download it vs purchasing the actual disk).  The interface is very user-friendly without much in the way of change from the other Word programs (of course it looks VERY different from the earlier ones, but if you are use to the more recent layouts you will recognize things).  Lots of fonts to choose from.  Auto-save recovery (that may be a computer thing :)<br />One suggestion for the people selling this it to have a compare and contrast chart for those of use who would like to use the product but don't know the difference between them.  Also with that chart maybe have a &#34;recommended user list&#34;.  I know this says for Home and Student vs Business etc, but WHAT makes that different.  Are we talking a true corporation or just extra tools that I might find useful as a writer or home business owner???  If these already exist, then I apologize however I looked and couldn't seem to find them anywhere.  Overall a good product with some small tweaking, specifically on marketing and advertising."
1,"[[ASIN:B00M76N6MO Quicken for Mac 2015]]I've only been using this for about a month. It took a couple hours to get my accounts linked and I still can't get my mortgages in.  However, I suspect that's user error.  I love being able to check my balances and spending categories easily and in one place.  I can change any uncategorized entries quickly.  I can add categories easily.  I would just like an easier way to add some accounts."

1,Great help doing my income tax
1,This is a great tool to use for doing your own taxes!!  Very easy step by step instructions.  I will be using next years version as well.
0,"I purchased this software because it is compatible with my banking center.  However, I found it very difficult to reconcile my checking out.  I couldn't adjust the starting balance without entering a bogus \\""Adjustment\\"" or \\""Starting Balance Adjustment\\"" entry."
1,Avast was recommended to me by a friend. She loves it. I do too! I feel confident that avast is 'watching' to keep my computer safe from viruses. Plus they are always updating which makes me feel safe too. I don't feel that I need to pay for something just as at ease. Thank you avast!
1,"My computer was infected with a bug that caused constant pop ups and took over my start page.  My old security program couldn't get rid of it, but this one did.  I've had it a few months now, and everything is running cleanly and smoothly, so it must be doing its job."
1,Very good and inexpensive product.
1,Nice price and easy install.
1,The price was terrific. The download time was speedy. The tech support was excellent. I have had this software running for about a month with good results. I would recomment this anti virus package highly. HalR
1,Had no issues with it. Highly recommend.
1,"Best user friendly software. The interface and the ease of navigation through customers, accounts and invoices make this software the best option for our small business."
1,I run a website development business out of my home and this is the perfect tool for me... I am so type A and this makes me feel so in control of my finances and invoices!!
1,Good
0,Was not able to download it to my computer.  They wanted too much money to fix problems on my computer.
1,Great!
0,I just bought this and it does not contain the latest version of Outlook!
0,its very pretty but it does not import current data from my bank. i can see the transactions in my bank's online system but Quicken does not find anything to import.<br /><br />I don't need to pay $75 to analyze archival data; i can get historical data for free.<br /><br />Slowken might be a more appropriate name for this.
0,"I use the Quicken Rental Property Version and updated to 2014 from the 2013 edition. I've been using Quicken for more than 30 years and have always found it indispensable for financial planning and management. Having said that, I don't see any advantage to the very expensive upgrade over 2013.  The Quicken Mobile device sync seems useless to me and just adds more text messages that don't tell me anything I don't already get from my bank.  I'd recommend upgrading every two years at most ad I think they will have a difficult time coming up with significant improvements that justify upgrading at those prices. Going to Quickbooks might make more sense cost-wise."
1,I got this to update my Office 2007.  It works very well and haven't had any troubles.  The download worked great.  I appreciate having access to my downloads on Amazon.
0,I'm buying but it's not working
1,"Worked very well, instant download is wonderful for those of us that wait until the last moment, thank you very much."
1,good
0,"I've been a TurboTax user for years, so when I discovered that they're not charging an exorbitant amount of money to add a Schedule C, I'm understandably upset. As if tax-time wasn't a big enough pain, TurboTax has made it that much worse. I will never waste my money on this company ever again. This is such a disappointment. Shame on you, Intuit."
0,"We have used Quicken since it ran on DOS: 20 or so years.  It was good then, and Intuit was good.  But in recent years the software has gotten bloated and seems buggier and worse ith every release.  Why don't they just debug it and make it work right??!!  We'd still be happy to pony up $40 to Intuit every three years, but just make it work!<br />We &#34;upgraded&#34; from Quicken 2013 to this, and again, it's worse.<br />We are looking at MoneyDance and GnuCash and will switch soon.<br />Goodbye, Quicken!  We had some good times, but it's over now.<br />Two stars, for old times sake."
0,"Paid $25, then 8 weeks later it stopped working. I cannot open the program nor run the program and no one at tech support will email me back.<br /><br />Hello, Malwarebytes, does anyone work there or is your company like that credit report commercial where mainframe computers pretend to be people?"
1,Good
0,"Okay... I have been buying TurboTax software for a few years now. They ALWAYS included 1 free copy of state version. With this package you are look at this page, it DOES NOT include 1 free copy of the state version. You will have to pay an additional $39.99 for just 1 state.<br /><br />Now I am out $35 buy buying this product as I will have to repurchase the one with the state (listed as $44.99 Prime price). Why in the world would you have 1 product priced at $34.99 while there is a better product at $44.99. People really do not want to spend the extra $10????!!!"
0,This product did not come with the LearnSmart registration code. Its a waste of money. Im highly upset.
1,"Love it, it's the best I've ever used.  Doesn't slow my PC down and has a great feature that protects you when you are paying bills or banking on line.  Will definitely renew."
0,this is a starter kit version only.  there are a great many more tasks you can do with the million dollar version but the cost of that is outrageous.  this is good enough for basic organizing and many basic editing tasks.  at least it's affordable.
1,"I have good service with Avast, and it meets my demand.  I will continue to use Avast. It continues to keep me up dated."
1,"An excellent program that I have used for years. However, for at least the last two years, when \\""Budgets\\"" is selected, The program reports that it has encountered a problem and needs to shut down - - - and it does just that. I reported the problem three or four times last year but the problem remains. Intuit, why can't you fix this? I will continue to use Quicken. If you don't need to establish a budget then this is the home financial program for you."
0,"(Very) Small business PC QB user for over 15 years. Switched to Mac and would love to have QB on Mac but after using it for a week, it's just not going to work out. Three words: NO MANUAL PAYROLL. As a tiny business with only 2 employees, manual payroll is the only way to go.  There is a way to finagle creating a payroll check as I did (http://www.qblittlesquare.com/2011/02/payroll-i-want-to-do-it-myself/), but you'll find that the absence of payroll/employee reports and the employee center render the product too much of a hassle. I'd make do without one or the other, but not both!<br /><br />I'd like to continue to support QB but not a payroll-less Mac version. So here's hoping that QB rectifies this in some way, or at least will meet us half way (i.e. allow manual payroll OR offer a small business friendly payroll price OR at least allow employee reports).<br /><br />Aside note about QBO: the new 'Self Employed' online option is a step in the right direction but also does not offer manual payroll OR an online payroll option; combine those two and you'd have a lot of new customers!"

1,"I'm a pretty casual user, more interested in making maps and importing my own artwork and running around than I am in making a plot.  Even in my limited use of it, it's still the best RPG making software that I've found so far and worth the price.  I've noticed a bit of a learning curve when changing the stats of characters and monsters, or making original auto-tiles, but the solutions to those problems are easily found.  The community is very active and helpful, which is very important for a product like this."

1,very comprehensive interview process leaving nothing to chances ! That is the reason I come back to H&R year after year...
0,The &#34;colors&#34; on Office 365 are less than blah!!!  It becomes depressing to work on it and you look for an excuse to leave your computer.  No more contrast and options to brighten the colors to a brighter blue or brighter.  I go back to my Office 10 on my old laptop and get an immediate boost in mood.  Pretty soon we users of Office 365 degenerate to 50 shades of Gray . . or dirty white.  What is Microsoft thinking of????????

1,"This is probably the eighth or ninth year I've done my taxes with TurboTax, and I wouldn't consider doing my taxes without it. Not only is it quick and easy, but the fact that you can now simply download the software right from Amazon makes it even more fast and convenient. From the the time I completed the purchase, to the point where the software was installed, updated, and up and running, was less than five minutes (on a computer that's 4+ years old). I already had all my tax-related documents in one place, so once I started our return it took maybe 30 minutes to complete it, including efiling both our federal and state returns. I don't know what more one could ask for. I remember the bad old days of spending hours and hours doing my taxes manually, and the confusion and anxiety that went with that. I'm so grateful to have a product like TurboTax now, and will never go back.<br /><br />The main issues people seem to be complaining about are:<br /><br />1) There's a fee for efiling your state return. - Honestly, it's been this way for as long as I can remember, and it's clearly stated in the product description that only efiling your federal return is included. If you didn't know you'd have to pay to efile your state return, it's your fault, not Intuit's.<br /><br />2) Problems downloading. - This, again, is not the fault of the product itself, or Intuit. You're downloading from Amazon, so if it's anyone's fault, it's theirs. That said, there's a 99% chance the issue is on your end. Not that that would be much comfort to someone having issues, but the point is that it's unfair to bash TurboTax because you're having trouble downloading it from a 3rd party's website. For what it's worth, I've purchased and downloaded software from Amazon on a number of occasions, including this one, and never had a problem.<br /><br />3) The refund bonus cards. - Well, this is a weird one. I didn't do it, because it seems silly to me, and I'd rather have more options of how to use my refund than spend it all at Amazon, but to each his own. On the other hand, it does seem like a huge customer service fail on Amazon's part that people are having to wait so long to get their refunds. And although I would expect some pretty high-level communication between Intuit and Amazon to get this resolved ASAP, it's still a problem with Amazon, not Intuit, or the TurboTax product."
1,I highly reccomend Avast. We are very pleased with this product.I would advice anyone to buy it. Would purchase it myself.
1,"Love that I can have access to vendors, customers and product all in one place.  Great product, user friendly.  Recommend to anyone in small business."
1,"I know this will come as no surprise to existing Adobe Ps customers, but for me CS6 is simply amazing. The clean interface, the ease of use etc... all of it is simply beautiful.<br /><br />Actually, perhaps I need to lay off using words like easy and simple, because this s/w is pretty deceptive. Other packages mimic the features of the Photoshop original, so using it turns out to be pretty straightforward for me (a first-time buyer)... however, there are pieces and parts to this that will take me a LONG time to get around to using.<br /><br />I now have a subscription to digital tutors because there's simply no other easy way (to me anyway) to getting my feet wet with all of this. On my 64-bit Mac this thing flies. And I feel my creativity soar. :)<br /><br />I love the collaboration with other tools like ZBrush too... what a terrific bonus, being able to simply click my way around. Love it."
1,"I gave it 5 stars because it's a good product. I haven't needed anything else since I have installed it. More than likely, I'll be getting the new one soon."
1,"I've been using Quicken for over 15 years, and I am always apprehensive when it comes time to update to a newer version. If you have never used Quicken before, I would rate this a 5 star; if you are an experienced user doing an upgrade, I would rate this a 3 as there really is not any new functionality or, if there is, I can't see it for the tasks I perform with Quicken.<br /><br />I made a backup of my existing file, and proceeded to install. Installation went without a hitch, and I didn't even need the backup as this installation recognized my file and took over from there with the conversion process: the conversion took some time to complete, so if you are doing an upgrade go find something to do around the house vs. sitting there staring at your computer.<br /><br />For the new user, this is one heck of a bookkeeping package. I highly recommend setting up the interface with your banks, investment accounts, etc. and have it automatically download to your software. Assign the categories, and after you get a good three months or so worth of data you can start seeing the results.<br /><br />New users - absolutely buy this now. Existing users, wait until the last possible minute before you have the required upgrade."
1,"Prior to using Avast I used almost all of the popular antivirus till 2007. And was extremely unsatisfied and due to virus attacks lots lots of my extremely data.<br />But once after started using Avast Free version from 2007, I've not come across even a single issue with virus.<br />I'm extremely happy to use Avast free version.<br /><br />I really want to thank Avast for making my computer safe."
0,I have struggled with it. When I opened the downloaded software for the first time the screen it Immediately brings up 9  pages saying &#34;a error in the script occurred on this page&#34;  I have tried to delete or fix the problem to no avail. Other computer technicians have tried to &#34;fix&#34; it but without success. It has proven a real frustration. I would never buy it again or try to upgrade. When I e-mailed about the problem about the problem I got no response.  I found the same annoying problem when I bought &#34;Dragon Speaks&#34;  leehomoki37@gmail.com
0,I wasn't able to use the online version of turbotax as I had too many state returns to file and they limit you online (I worked as an independent contractor in 7 different states) so I had to get the desktop version. I found it a bit more confusing and not straightforward about the filing fees. I hope to not to have to use this next year.
1,Seems to be working very good. Only thing that seems a little annoying are some pop up ads that make you think it's some sort of upgrade you need to do but then it turns out its something else they are selling. But I do only have the free version so I guess it's something to compromise with. Had security essentials prior for free and it was fine with no ads etc.....
0,It does not load and stops working.  I have had no chance to use this product.  IT DOES NOT WORK!
1,It seems this had more intuitive answers than other previous years and worked flawlessly for me. Saved me much effort and time. Hope next years will be as good.
1,H&R Block is a company you can trust. I had my taxes done in no time with minimal irritation. I did my state and federal returns with E-file. I got my refund in six business days. Amazon has the best price on the Internet.

1,"I don't typically write reviews but I found that a few users on here stated that this was a 30-day trial version. It is not! This gives you a subscription for one year. In order to avoid confusion on my computer I decided to delete the current version of Norton that I had then download this version that I just bought. However, if you look in your account, you will find that it gives you the product code key that you need to renew your current subscription. If you find that you have anything less than 365 days left on your subscription after downloading this version then you have done something wrong or simply missed a step."

1,This program is as good the more expensive typing programs out there and it works on Windows 7.  It provides several customize-able ways to learn.
1,Nice program
1,"I have used avast Free Antivirus for a couple of years, and as far as I can tell I have not had a virus infect my computer. I like the fact that avast automatically and routinely updates its virus database."
0,"As far as I can tell, the program is ok. However, for the price paid, a hardcopy manual should at least be availalbe, if not provided. Trying to follow a soft manual with so many references to multiple locations throughout the manual for any given topic, is difficult if not impossible on the computer, while you're trying to use the program at the same time."
1,"Easy install, pulled my data from previous Norton product. Works well, seems to be less of a resource drag than my old Norton utilities was. Easy using the multiple licenses on other computers."
0,"I found it easy to use, however it is not letting meimport the data from American Express data so far."
1,"I waited for some time before upgrading from 2011 after reading multiple reviews of bad experiences. 2013 was at about update 11 (R11?) when I decided to download it. I've been very happy as it seems to have seamlessly transferred all of my data.<br />The mobile connection recently provided me a potential money-saving benefit when I received a mobile alert email that my credit card had been charged a foreign transaction fee. Checking my account online I had noticed and disputed one foreign transaction already. The mobile alert prompted me to look again and I found yet another. Bottom line is, I had my credit card provider cancel that account and transfer it to another as I'd apparently had my number stolen/compromised. I will be a repeat customer."
0,"It does a very good job. But there is a lot of competition out there (much of it free) that allows you to do pretty much the same thing. However, only some of the competition has all of the features. Some of the open source projects get pretty close though. It's a good purchase though to have it all in one place."
1,"Subscription is better way to go. Always up to date, less expensive in long run, just price of one lunch in fast food. Very nice and useful additions to applications. Pro or hobbies, this way to go."
1,I have had no virus I just love the way they always monitor my system a great product so easy to use
1,"As soon as I installed and fired up the 2015 version of [[ASIN:B00M9GTHS4 Quicken Deluxe 2015]], all of my problems went away! I think my 2014 version had gotten corrupt, so I re-installed it, only to have the same issues re-surface. Then, in the mail came the 2015 CD, just in time! One of the issues I was having (new) was that when I wanted to do a reconciliation, there were approximately 20 debits and the total said $0. Then in the income side, it did the same thing. All the deposits equaled zero, so the total on the bottom (income minus expenses) showed a negative balance! I probably should have deleted the program and done a fresh install, but by then 2015 arrived and I installed that instead. Voila! no more frustration. The other issue I had was a printing error on my checks where it would omit part of the top line (payee name and date). Fortunately, I have another printer on my network. Again, 2015 solved that. I'm happy. As for the rest of the program, I have yet to test it all out, but since I have been using Quicken since the 1980's, I'm pretty much sold on its performance and content. I does more than I really need, but at tax time it even exports my tax items into TurboTax for me ([[ASIN:B00NG7JVSQ TurboTax Deluxe 2014 Fed + State + Fed Efile Tax Software + Refund Bonus Offer]]). I'm spoiled rotten. It's like having my own personal CPA at my beck and call. Thanks, Intuit!"
1,"Bought this for my six year old, and he loves it. It's helping him learn to type, and he thinks it's really fun. I wish he could select the different games and have them start at his word level though, rather than some of them being too advanced."
0,Turbo Tax gets more expensive every year.  And starting out with the free edition is just a scam.  Might as well pay someone to prepare your taxes for you.
0,I started with H&R and ended with Turbo tax.  Enough said.
1,"For the two years that we have had Avast protecting our computer we have never had a problem. When we would check out what they had screened and all that had been covered, it is amazing that nothing has gotten through or negatively effected us. You can't find a better service. We would highly recommend Avast for anyone looking to be problem free when it comes to protecting your computer. Thanks Avast!"
1,I love that you have the ability to manage your account from any operating system anywhere you have an internet connection. An amazing tool for someone wanting to be on the leading edge. I only gave 4 stars because I want to see this product pushed even further. Intuit has done great!
0,"Very Frustrated!!! I downloaded the product, Assuming the free upgrade would be downloaded as well.  Remember what assuming does....  I worked through all my taxes to the point of needing forms that were in the upgrade....and up pops a note that tells me I have to upgrade at the cost of $30.00 to continue.  This is a purchase made through intuit not Amazon.  I tried using my Amazon confirmation number for the original purchase and that didn't work.  I came back to Amazon to re-read the info regarding my purchase and saw nothing indicating that I needed to download again.  OK Taxes in themselves are aggravating enough and not having what I needed to complete them was frustrating.  I went back to my taxes and purchased the upgrade from Intuit.  Intuit I will find another way to do my taxes next year...what a way to make a few more $$ ...so I come back to write my review and find there is an upgrade available in my library.  I have now paid $70.00 for a program to complete my taxes.  I wish Amazon's Directions for this free upgrade had been a bit more precise and I wouldn't have wasted another $30.00 to get an upgrade I apparently already had but needed to download."
0,"It wouldn't install to my computer even as it is fully updated. I am not satisfied, and want a refund. I like Norton but this is a bit ridiculous."
1,"Excellent product, very effective. Thank you."
1,"It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive architecture programs, but if you are just doing this as a hobby or to sketch out some ideas, it is a great deal for the price."
0,"After purchase I am sent to the Microsoft website where I get error messages.    An error has occurred  We are sorry but an error has occurred and we cannot setup your Office account at this time. Please save the Product Key below and come back to [...] and try again later. If you continue having problems, please contact support."
1,Works great and does not bog my system down.Safe browsing habits are usually frofront line priority but it's always nice to have something watching your back.
1,"Turbo tax is easy to use, it takes through lots of questions and tells you what you are due or owe, then files for you."
1,I love it!  Avast is wonderful... Being free it helps so much in keeping my computer safe.  Thank you for Avast Free Antivirus... Being on Disability it helps so much.
1,Absolutely the only product to use when you need to migrate hardware (i.e. you get a new and better laptop).
0,Rejected Avas new upgrade and in unloading it their software left my computer with a 169--- IP address which cut me off from the internet.
1,I recently installed this product and so far it appears to be working similar to my norton 360 which just expired. The $19.99 introductory price is what was the deciding factor in this download purchase. Thus far I have only installed it on windows pc's.
0,"Since Intuit sunsets automatic downloads on their products after 3 years, you have to purchase the newer version in order to keep that capability. That is the ONLY reason to get Quicken 2012.<br /><br />I just installed, since my older version (2009 - another forced \\""upgrade\\"") was going to lose that functionality very shortly.<br /><br />The new version is incredibly slow - as in, try to accept a downloaded transaction, it pops up a window (rather than just having the transaction appear in the register and be editable there if needed), then wait 45 seconds for it to accept and actually go to the next transaction. It actually looks like it's ignoring you completely.<br /><br />Someone needs to come up with a competitor to Intuit's stranglehold on the personal-finance marketplace. They keep adding features that do nothing but line their own pockets, while ignoring features that would truly make their product useful in the 21st century."
1,Very good
0,"I tried to submit my taxes at the end of January.  While the file was transferring to the federal gov't, my computer crashed.  When I re-opened, the file was corrupted.  I submitted a ticket online for support.  In turn, Intuit asked for log files so they could investigate.  As of 3/7/2015, they have NEVER gotten back to me.  So today, I tried to call them to get some live support.  You will never find a customer service number.  You have to process a question online in order for them to give you the coveted number.  So, I go through this process, call them and 2 hours later they still have not resolved my issue.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, when I first tried to process my taxes in January, TurboTax charged my account $20 for the transmission that never took place!  I've used TurboTax every year for about 10 years.  This is THE LAST year.  Never again.  If you're thinking about buying this product, DON'T."
0,"I've been using Quicken for at least 15 years.  I use it in combination with a PDA that has an electronic checkbook program.  When I purchased Quicken Essentials I discovered that Quicken no longer supports its own QIF data exchange format; it only supports QFX.  Unfortunately, I can't find a single checkbook program for a PDA or smartphone (including iPhone and iPod Touch) that support QFX; they all support QIF.  Quicken used to sell its own PocketPC version for PDAs, but they discontinued that too.  So unless you intend to carry your laptop or desktop to the store with you, it's pretty useless to buy financial management software that can't exchange information.    In 2005 Apple introduced Intel-based Macs and a migration path.  Intuit failed to keep step with the migration path by producing a universal binary version of Quicken for the Mac.  In 2009, Apple introduced Snow Leopard, the first purely Intel Mac OS.  So the clock has run out on previous, more capable versions of Quicken for Mac, and all that Intuit has to show for the last 5 years is Quicken Essentials.  As Mac users move ahead with newer versions of Mac OS, Quicken is positioned to fade away with the past.    There is a very old rule in the information system business for keeping customers happy; with each new version, give your customer what they have today plus a little bit more.  Intuit obviously hasn't learned that lesson, and they've just lost another customer."
1,The addidtional storage provided me by Amazon is actually a very good advantage for me with even 5 terrabytes of local storage.  It will assist me in case my computer melts down again.
1,Good Product
0,Used for approximately 10 years and have liked it.  Until this year when I filed and was told a return had already been filed.  Turns out it was filed though turbotax using a different account.  Seems odd that for the last 10 years my SSN has been associated with the same online login and they allow a filing using a new account.  Not sure I will use them again next year.  We'll have to see how much of a headache it is to get my refund.  My in-laws had the same happen last year (again with turbotax).  Nice that they allowed me to pay again to file with them.
0,"The EULA agreement, which few read, contains some pretty clever billing practices. Why does Amazon list this as free?"
1,Very good thank you
1,"I used an excel for years to track my spending, but with Quicken 2013, you can easily set it up to download all your transactions from your bank account. It will automatically fill in the information for you. It also helps you to easily set up a budget which was hard to get my wife to do until I got this program."
0,Functional software but very generic looking. Outlook 2007 and 2010 are much more pleasing to the eyes. As far as I am concerned I wasted my money and as everyone knows once you buy software there is no returning it.
1,"I run a website and needed to make instructional videos on how to use the site and this program was perfect for that!  I just narrated along with simple microphone while going through the functionality of my website and worked like a charm.  While not a very powerful editing suite, it had plenty enough functionality for me to put titles and crossfades and such in to make my presentation look professionally done.  I highly recommend this product for those looking to do what I did."
1,"I have used Avast free  since it first came out many many years ago and it has become one of the very best free anti-virus programs out there.  All the protection you will ever need is in this program.  No cost for updates and all you do is register for 1 year and then re-register yearly there after, nothing else.  The program keeps you safe as it has stopped so many different types of virus's, malware and other malicious data that is out there from getting into my computer and other's that I have recommended it to.<br />You can not go wrong using this program as it is rated very high in the computer magazines I read along with the programs you do have to pay for.<br />If you are tired of paying fees for a program you are tiring of paying for, do try Avast Free and you will love it as I do."
1,"This was fast and easy ... download was simple. Added to my norton account  with no problems. I would recommend downloading from amazon to all my friends,."
1,Just as good as the Microsoft version for a lot more money!
1,"This product is installed and working perfectly on three computers right now.  It was a fast download with a easy to find folder on the desktop.  It uninstalls previous versions which required a reboot...then just open Norton, navigate to the Support tab and then &#34;product key&#34; -  put in your key code and you are in business.  It was advertised to work on XP, which is what I needed, but after the download, the product did not list it  - only Vista, Windows 7/8  -  but alas not to worry... it is working just fine."
0,for some reason the geniuses over at quickbooks have pigeon holed their software to only work with internet explorer when it comes to exporting your data from an online account to a desktop account. the funny thing is that windows doesn't make IE for the new mac operating systems.  none of this is communicated before you buy the program and now i have an online account that doesn't seamlessly translate to my desktop accounting.  thumbs down.
0,"No auto reconcile (reconciling of the online balance each download rather than reconciling of the monthly statement). No bill pay, but don't do that as much these days. Still, I can do it with the PC version.<br />Having more than a dozen accounts and auto reconciling several in Quicken 2015 for PC, it would be very difficult or even impossible to convert accurately. I don't know why the Mac version is so different from the PC version. I probably could have adjusted to the differences, but without auto reconcile. .no. Paying too much for a program that should convert easily. I returned and got money back. I'll just stick with my PC for doing the banking until I figure out something better. They add the auto reconcile feature in  and I might give it another try."
1,This product is excellent and does what is expected of it. No more unexpected malware interrupting your web browsing.I will definitely recommend this product above all.
0,Warning: do not purchase this thinking you can import prior tax year information if you used H&R Block's website to file in the past.  I just spoke with customer service and was told that this is impossible.  The website and the software are incompatible.
0,"The bad:  A Minnesota tax penalty form prevented me from eFiling my state return, unfortunately TurboTax told me that AFTER I entered my credit card and charged me $24.99.  I could not cancel the charge from their web site, I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone AND give my SSN to the support person.  I still can't believe they charge 24.99 to eFile the state return after I spent $70 on this software.<br /><br />Only good thing: The software automatically imported my 1099 data from E*Trade which HR Block did not do last year with the Deluxe version."
0,"Had trouble from day 1 with inability to connect with the internet without restarting the PC, scanned the PC, chatted with them and was assured nothing wrong with their software. Then discovered if I shut down the firewall I could connect to the internet without restarting the PC. Chatted again without success. Tried uninstalling the software and reinstalling, again without success. Finally uninstalled the software and downloaded Malwarebytes that found 2 suspicious items and quaranteed them. Now I connect without McAfee...Isn't that McAfee was supposed to do?  Can't figure out how to get a refund ???"
1,Upgraded from Elements 7 and love the improvements.
1,Program is easy to use and works great.  Recommended to anyone looking for an easy to use envelope printer program.
1,"As I have said, I have not yet really used the software but based on everything I have seen and heard it is a great product for the money. I know many people who have used the software for years and continue using it due to its constancy in quality. I'm sure I is not the nicest peace of editing software out there but it is something you can't argue about the price on.<br /><br />The software download was super convenient from amazon. I really wish that this was an option for more software. Its nice to have your product key right there in the cloud and your installation media ready for you to download any time. I would strongly recommend printing out your license key information out  just in case some thing happens.<br /><br />All in all this is an awesome price for a great software package. I would total recommend this deal to someone who wants to get in to video editing and does not have a huge pocket full of change. Thanks amazon for providing such handy access to a great software bundle from Sony!"
1,No problems upgrading to Quicken 2015. With other versions the color and fonts changed. It took a while to set up other versions but 2015 was right from the start.
1,I have a love hate relationship with this product. I love it when it is working and I hate it when it isn't . Most of the time it is but when it isn't they have a great tech team !
1,This is a great product. I have been using it for years and it works like a good luck charm.
1,"Works very well and have used this software for years.  However, doing my daughter's (who lives in the city) taxes, the software made an error for the second year in a row with her NY State return.  Having instructions from the IRS helped me manually insert the proper amount in the required form and the program completed the rest without a problem.  Otherwise no problems."
0,Did it work yes...did not like the way the company responded to all the issue's this year. Offering money...than offering up grades...sorry turbo tax...this is my last year.
0,This download resulted in the near death of my computer because of some fatal error condition that occurred.  My IT person (who rebuilt my machine) said he wished that he had known I was going to install this software because he would have told me not to do so!
0,"I just upgraded from Quicken 2011, and don't see any real immediate benefits.  Some functions, like auto update are in a different (hidden) location, but beyond that nothing visible is new."
1,"Love Norton.....will not get on the internet without it,,,,,,,,most times best pricing is on Amazon"
0,"My download also asked for a disk to be inserted.  Have been on hold with the companies customer service for over 30 min, listening to recordings of stuff to do that I don't understand.  Waste of my time.  Don't waste yours."
0,I can't even use this product to find out how good it is. I've been on the phone with Microsoft for 3 hours after issues installing. Microsoft has the worst customer service and they transfer you so many times your head will spin. Then they told me they'd call me. I'd advise not bothering with this purchase as it's a gamble just in case there is a problem. I'm going to see if Amazon will be able to refund me.
0,"Let me first say that I used the online version of this same program, and I have been using TurboTax for several years without any problems. The program \\""reviews\\"" your taxes for you, making it harder to find mistakes until its too late. I noticed that the Use Tax for my state return was not correct, so I tried to change it. The program let me change the amount. It even changed the amount on the calculated number on the side of the screen. It allowed me to print out the form with the correction, and the form says that it had been e-filed. Days later, after not receiving a confirmation email, I go back to the website and find that the tax return with the mistake is the one that was filed and accepted by the government. Now I have two different versions of the same tax form. When I tried to do a formal amendment, the corrected form showed up on the screen and said I didn't make any changes to my taxes. Furthermore, it wiped out my entire state refund amount (no reason for this to happen since it still shows a refund on my \\""corrected\\"" form), and my entire federal refund. I didn't change anything on my federal report!!!!<br /><br />I tried contacting customer service. They hide the number and make you go through several steps just to get to it. The first number it showed me was just an automated service that told me my forms had been accepted. I went through the process again, and a different number came up. I explained the problem, and the woman on the line just said I had to mail in the amended form. No apology for the problem or anything. She couldn't even explain why I had two different versions of the same form. By they way, as you can see from the previous paragraph, she wasn't very helpful.<br /><br />They lost a long-time customer this year. I paid $91 dollars to use this service, and it screwed me over. Now I have to find a way to correct this mess, and I still have to mail in my state taxes. Maybe TurboTax could spend more time developing software and customerservice than on commercials."

1,"This program is a great addition to the digital artist's toolbox.  Obviously, it's specifically tailored for the creation of comics, but the drawing tools are better than Photoshop's in some respects (particularly for linework).  The learning curve is kind of steep but similar enough to PS that an experienced user can pick it up quickly.  I highly recommend the tutorials Smith Micro has on their website to quickly get a handle on the many powerful features of this program."
1,"My husband recommended me to download this product and I'm glad that I did. It works well and is seemingly easy enough to use. I haven't utilized it to it's full capacity, but thus far it seems to work out pretty good for what I have used it for. I'm grateful for this item."
1,"I have not used Norton for years, so the upgraded, more streamlined look was a bit of a surprise, and frankly a bit confusing (should be an easier way to, say, turn everything off), but no real complaints so far."

0,"I have used QUICKEN for 15 years. Over time it has gotten more difficult to use. For example, there should be a simple button for \\""Write Checks\\"" since this happens all the time. Instead it is buried in a menu under \\""TOOLS\\"" - not intuitive. However, I have to have financial check writing and finance tracking software. I wish the developers would make improvements to simplify rather than complicate it's use for just writing checks and tracking spending."
1,"I am pleased with the program and like all of the features but it has been trying to update for the past two weeks and fails every time.  Then it doesn't tell you why it is failing.  So, they really need to work on this."
1,"I actually bought the deluxe version and it is fantastic and most importantly very intuitive.  Other peoples low reviews are most likely due to computer problems, not sure but its definitely not the software. I felt compelled to correct these persons reviews. Like I said, I paid full price $60 for this software on Wondershares website and my wife and I have made 2 videos for friends as Christmas gifts. They were so good and touching that a couple of the ladies were in tears over the powerful content we were able to include in our movie with the use of this software. They even have a 30 day money back guarantee. The only thing I do not like about the software is the lack of intro/credit sequences available, there are only a few to choose from."
0,"The starter version can only monitor checking, savings and credit card account. I requested a refund because I want to use other version. I email Intutite and they send me the refund check 1 month later."
1,"I am completely satisfied with this product! The interface is easy to use, and the program does the job it is designed to do very well. If I need any additional capabilities (which I occassionally do), I can purchase them easily from the program interface."
1,"Easy to use, never had a problem with this software.  I like the fact that it automatically tell you if you need to correct anything and at the end it gives you a meter to see whether you are at risk of getting audited.  I've used this software for the last six years."
1,"I have used several other design programs, over the years. The only major problem that I have found with this program is trying to figure out how to do some of the design features. I think this program is written assuming that you have a more extensive background in this type of designing. It is a large learning curve that I am slowly overcoming. Otherwise, I really like the flexibility offered by this program."
1,"We have used it.We like it,it does a good job. For the most part it runs in the back ground and does not bother me. Then someone desires to force us to do our own download for update of terms.

1,Have used TurboTax for years. So quick and easy.
1,Very good software
0,"There's no need to get every single menial update they come out with. I would previously keep my photoshop version for a few years before upgrading. The little periodic updates they give in return for your perpetual allegiance is a small gain for the consumer. Once they have enough subscribers what's the point of them continuing to offer service if everyone is already forced to use their product? Seems like the worst kind of monopoly plot. I understand they hate software piracy, maybe that's because the software is too expensive? When I was a recent grad and a freelancer I could never have afforded to pay for the software, I bought used cd's from ebay, but now everything is a digital download. Look at the pricing of Apple Final Cut Pro x in comparison, that is much more affordable for the young and new videographer."
1,I have used this product for a couple of years now and it hasn't let me down yet.I also installed it on my grandsons laptop and he hasn't had any problems since.
0,Here's what I didn't like:<br /><br />Help was minimal.<br />One of the forms I had to get from the IRS website.<br />Had problems creating a PDF file of my returns (never had the problem with Turbo Tax.)<br />Needed a second state and that cost me $40.  To e-file the second state costs $19.95 plus tax.<br />A change in the Fed return did not carry over into the State but at least the software told me it had to be manually corrected.  I couldn't figure out how to get to the worksheet that had to be changed. Wasted an hour before I figured it out.
0,Seems that there's not much improvement and that it's a lot slower than my previous 2012 version of the same program.  Quite disappointed.  Not worth the upgrade.
0,I could not open this software at all.
1,"The only issue I have is that I hade the basic Quicken for the last two years, so I had to save all the files then uninstall the old....for this situation it was not actually a upgrade but a basic install..."
1,"The good: No major changes in displays, or capabilities from 2012. LOVE the capability select length of future time to show scheduled activities in each account. Lets us see the cash flow in a much more effective way than that useless graph. Also the My Money tab in the Home window is much improved over Q2012 - we really like the Last 30 days Spending and Bill and Income Reminders sections, especially since both can be set to different date ranges and accounts.<br /><br />The not-so-good: I used Quicken to back up the master file, then I moved the original and copied it back to the original location using Windows Explorer. Q2104 would install, load the [copied] master file, convert it then crash after asking for the pw, with some strange error codes. Tried numerous re-installs and finally moved the original master file to its original location and Q2014 opened it normally. Seems like Q2014 somewhere checks the [Windows] file name against a name written internally within the Quicken file. Unfortunately, it  took about 45 minutes of grubbing through the Intuit support area to get a clue that the crash indicated a file data integrity problem.<br /><br />The budgeting option is still VERY weak and clunky. Selection of categories to use and values for When switching among dates to display, the latest entries do not always display immediately. You still cannot<br /><br />The beats-me: We don't try to have instant updates from banks on our smart phones so we haven't tried Quicken Cloud interface. We still worry about having our finances anywhere other than on our hard disk. We just don't see the benefit of having continually updated finances being worth the cost of continually managing them or the risk of compromise."
0,"This software is horrible!  It is dependent on you to know much more about the tax law than any common person would know. If you have any situations that are slightly peculiar you will have to try to chat online. I tried this once and I was 23rd in the queue. Needless to say, after 10 minutes of not moving up one spot I ended the session. I will try again when I have more time. If I had my time back, I wouldn't have wasted it on this software."
0,"Whether or not you buy it here, whether or not this is from the actual company. This software is absolutely ridiculously bad. I knew it was before I even spent time with it, but I wanted to see how bad it really was. I installed a fresh copy of windows, ran my usual trusted tools that I've used as a PC tech for years and installed their free software. I noticed several flaws and misleading information.<br /><br />Flaws:<br />* adds several startup items that will slow down your computer even more, pretty common sense from the standpoint of software that is built to better your PC.<br /><br />* gives false positives and lumps them all into a few categories to scare you into using their software.<br /><br />*claimed I already had viruses when I ran over 8 antivirus/antispyware scanners outside of windows which provides better accuracy and effectiveness at removing malicious software. All of my scanners came up clean. Lets be realistic, if they had the best malicious software detection they wouldn't be advertising via infomercials.<br /><br />I laughed, took notes for my website, and uninstalled it. Although, unsuccessfully. There were remnants of the software starting up at installation still. And still giving misleading messages about the status of the computer. I got a little frustrated and uninstalled the remaining fragments, the common user wouldn't know how to do this. This software, by doing this, can actually fall into the category of a virus itself. Misleading you to get your money is one of the more recent tactics used by hackers.<br /><br />Dont waste your time, pay a professional or just reinstall windows. There is no easy way to fix an old outdated or infected computer. And I shouldn't need to note that achieving 100% more speed is impossible. This is m"
1,I've been using this system for a few years.  Very happy with it.  It has warned me several times and I will definitely renew next year.
1,There is not much to say about Quicken 2015. I have used Quicken for 20 years and upgrade it every other year. I love this program.
0,"Having been a TurboTax user for years, I purchased the 2014 version expecting more of the same solid product I had experienced in the past.  I was sorely disappointed!  Apparently the makers violated the adage, &#34;if it ain't broke, don't fix it,&#34; this year, because clearly, a number of changes were made that seriously impeded the software.  Why they were made is a mystery, but most commonly these changes are made because someone sees the potential for more profit by changing or short-cutting certain areas.  Some expense areas seemed to be incomplete while the income sections were extensive.  Three major problems:  (1) Software seemed clunky, not as easy to make sense of; (2) On completion I was unable to print a copy for my files, system simply refused to print; and (3) I was unable to forward the completed forms to the government, state or local.  The only way this was resolved was a call to TurboTax.  It took quite a while, but thanks to the Customer Service Personnel, I was able to compete the task.  That said, it is no joy to pay $50 for a product only to find it isn't what one had been promised. Not certain if I will use their service again."
1,Great price for Antivirus that works
0,"Pretty Sad.  After calling Turbo Tax to complain that i have to bump up to the premier edition to file my taxes for the same exact tax situation as i had the previoius years, all they could do was tell me that i will get an email at the END OF THIS YEAR with some kind of discount to purchase TT for 2015.  Not exactly good customer service.  Looks like i will be joining those who will switch to another software provider to do their personal home taxes.  All i need was to be able to submit my schedule D investment form."
0,"Terrible, terrible product! Keep getting stupid error message when trying to prepare 1099's, or being kicked out for \\""inactivity\\"" while working. Impossibly slow, too. Would have never purchased if I knew all of this before. Extremely disappointed."
1,Really the only option for self-prepared income tax.  If you have any very unusual income or deductions it's still a good idea to review the results - they do occasionally fail to follow through with some of the more obscure stuff.
0,"The actual calculation of the return was fine.  However, it advertized as 1 Free State Return but I had to pay $24.99 to file the State.  That's not FREE"
0,Here is why I hate this<br /><br />1. Buggy and glitchy.<br /><br />2. Does not work right.<br /><br />3. Slows down your computer.<br /><br />Do not download this virus!
0,"Don't buy this version of Outlook!  I'm surprised a product could have this many issues and microsoft wouldn't bother to produce a fix. This was a money sink for me - oodles of hours of tech support, and I have to rely on my webmail. I have IMAP e-mail service - it's so glitchy it's essentially unuseable."
1,Does the job it says it does. Thank you AVAST!
1,"Downloaded the app and immediately went to work reviewing my accounts.  It was  a seamless change from the older QUICKEN I had.  I have found no glitches.  I, however, do not stress the app.  I simply want a checkbook register and that is what I have here.  Works fine."
1,"Works. That's all I need to say. For the most part, not a pain in the... just works. I have it on all my devices."
0,Is not friendly with VirtualBox.  This makes the software totally useless to me.  Do not buy this if you want to use Virtualbox on the machine you have this installed on.
0,"When Quicken insists on updating it has caused problems with my computer. It corrupted some files causing the machine to lose the current user one time and another time it simply hung the machine requiring a \\""hard\\"" reboot."
1,Great price.
1,Going on my 10th year of using Turbotax and am a loyal fan.  Any issues I have ever had are quickly corrected by their tech support.<br /><br />Also appreciate the ability to be able to download it directly.  No sense in wasting boxes and paper.  The only thing I would like to see is a price break for downloading.  There is no doubt it costs them less when someone downloads and I think a price break would get more customers to download.
1,I've been a Turbo Tax user for personal taxes for many years. The fact that I keep coming back is probably the best statement I can make about the ease and accuracy of doing my own taxes.
0,"Crashes. I'm a long time user (15 years), this has never happened before. Crashes when loading data. I spent a couple hours with tech support as they asked me to download all sorts of data from my computer. That was about 3 weeks ago. Got an email asking users to sign up for another phone contact, Email acknowledged that there are a lot of people having this problem. I signed up for the call, they didn't call. Just got another email asking me to sign up again since they couldn't get to all the people who signed up. don't buy this product until this bug is fixed."
0,I can't down load the program and there isn't a number to contact or web site to assist me for help.
1,EXCELLENT SOFTWARE PACKAGE. WAS EASY TO USE AND DOUBLE CHECKED MY ENTRIES AND ASKED GOOD QUESTIONS
1,"IObit Malware Fighter 2.5.0 is a good competitor to the Malwarebytes 2.0.4.1028. It helps you to remove trojan horse, adware, malware or any other on your computer.

0,"I've used Quicken for years. This is an absolute dog of an update. It kills my computer. The biggest issue is that it has just deleted a vast number of expense categories in my category list. So, when I say the categories themselves are gone, this means that I have years of records that are now randomly uncategorized. Talk about years of record-keeping just corrupted in one update process. It has made changes to my accounts in it. Forgotten names of currently used accounts. Brought back old, closed accounts, given them old balances and won't let you delete them. Doesn't even start without several tries of clicking the program start several times. It has removed most of your access to control OneStep Update and pin vault; and in the process screwed up all the accesses so you already had so you really do need to gain access to fix them. But you can't. It tries to duplicate accounts from Chase Bank every time you open it. It doesn't try to duplicate accounts from anywhere else, it just really wants me to have a lot of accounts from Chase, And it deleted all my register information from Chase that I had tracked in Quicken 2012. Tech support has been even more mind-shatteringly useless. Really a terrible update that's not ready for prime time."
1,A license can not be used for an android device.
0,"This program is cluttered with promotions for add-ons and things that I don't want or wouldn't use.  It seems all about selling MORE.  Also, the method of seeking support is convoluted:  If you don't seek support every day, it takes 10 minutes to discover how to get it.  Then all it offers is an email request with a reply hours or days later.<br /><br />How do you unsubscribe from the 60 day trial - when they already got your credit card?  I searched for half an hour to try to find out - finally emailed them and waiting for a reply."
0,"I upgraded to the 2012 version from the 2010 version hoping Intuit has FINALLY seen the light. They haven't. For whatever reason Intuit seems to view the Mac version of their accounting software as the useless step-child. While the 2012 version is decidedly improved, it is still ARCHAIC compared to their 1995 Windows version. From reading the forums I have found that numerous people, including myself, have had a problem where QB credits a customer without using the credits. Hard to explain but the result is that the customer shows a zero balance, but has a perpetual credit that refuses to go away. I had learned to work around it in the 2010 version, but it has come back to life in the less than two weeks since I \\""upgraded\\"". Intuit offered back in 2010 to fix my problem but only if I send them an additional several hundred $$$$ on top of the several hundred dollars I have already given them. As a business owner, I don't have the time to sit on IGNORE for hours on end and, besides that, I never learned to speak East Indian. Additionally, despite the name \\""Intuit\\"", the Mac version of Quickbooks is anything but intuitive. As I said, the 2012 version is an improvement, but still archaic by comparison. If you haven't yet converted your accounting program to Mac, don't. You'll be disappointed. The next best suggestion, if you have to have an Intuit product and want to use your Mac, would be to get the windows version and run it on Parrallels. Intuit for Mac has a STEEP learning curve and requires numerous work-arounds. Their product is the ONLY thing about my Macs I hate."
1,to much money to keep but a good buy ^_^<br />so buy if you want a good program than buy this
1,"Although the look was a little different, I love the ease of converting my data & making entries."
1,"I've tried any number of Internet security suites over the years.  Norton's product is far superior to its offerings of 6-10 years ago.  The installation was quick and easy (both with our Windows 7 and our Windows 8 pc's), and after an update of the AV definitions, the suite quickly proved to be running and monitoring our pc's protection against unwanted intruders.  I can't recommend it enough."
0,"I purchased and used Punch many years ago.  At the time, as I remember, I didn't find it too difficult to use and it worked for what I needed.  Recently I purchased the Landscape Design 17.5 online version.  I was particularly interested in being able to add a photo of my current house and then be able to see a variety of landscape options around it to help us decide which way to go. I've been attempting to do this for about a month now and am about to give up.  I did finally manage to create a plan of the house though when it displays in 3d parts of it have roof showing properly and parts of it have what appear to be wall frame or some such sticking up out of the roof - I have no idea why.  I don't find the program remotely intuitive - nor do I understand why there are so many different versions and prices.  There was no option for me to upgrade from my original version, either.<br /><br />I understand that there are many video tutorials that can be accessed but that is not a medium that suits my way of learning.  I work best with written instructions and diagrams, images and illustrations.  Evidently, the &#34;old-fashioned&#34; user manual is now a thing of the past, even though it could be just as easily provided in electronic format for download and printed at will by the user - thus Punch wouldn't have to pay the cost of producing a print copy.  I note that they are offering a third party manual at an extra cost which I find exorbitant for an online manual - particularly as I am in Australia and the exchange rate is so bad that everything from the US costs so much more for us.<br /><br />Yes, forums can be great places for answers but, for basic operational information I expect to be able to follow straight-forward instructions and work through them step by step.  I don't think I'm an idiot, I've been using computers since the days of multiple DOS OS versions and the Apple II, Commodore 64 and early Amstrads.  Maybe I am getting too old and stupid or in the early stages of dementia but I am having great trouble mastering even the simple aspects of this program; don't know whether I bought the most appropriate package or not - as they all seem similar in their descriptions; can't figure out for the world of me how to convert a ral image of my house and landscape so that I can work on it; and find it an affront that I am expected to pay for a user manual on top of the purchase price.<br /><br />I may persevere a little longer but I am so frustrated that unless I can make progress soon, I'm afraid I'll just have to write off my purchase as a stupid mistake or recognise that I'm a total cretin who can't even operate what is advertised as having &#34;one-click&#34; capability for adding walls and roofs, etc.  I don't want to criticise unfairly so I can only assume that my problems reflect my own inabilities or limitations.  However, as I build MS Access databases, use Scrivener, build web-sites with Joomla and Wordpress, do accounting with Excel and utilise a whole lot of other software without difficulty, I find it strange that I should suddenly have such problems - early onset dementia, perhaps?"
1,I have found that this program  works.  So far I have not had a problem.  It has found all viruses that have tried to infect my computer.
1,"Very thorough suite of learning games, I would highly recommend this bundle to anyone wanting their kids to get a leg up on their coursework. There are increasing levels of difficulty, and right now my 5yr old is still doing some of the more basic features. I can definitely see this growing with him for years to come, it is pretty all-encompassing and engaging. He actually WANTS to play the various games. Highly recommended."
1,No $ owed .. that's fine by me
0,only let me use it for a 30 day trial
1,I have used Quicken Deluxe for years and the 2013 version is just plane great!  That is all I can say.
1,Excellent price
1,thanks
1,I like the way this tax program asks a lot of questions and puts in the numbers. I just collect my receipts and jump on the computer and get er done!!
1,"The first time I tried this course I failed miserably because it launches you directly into reading Hiragana characters and trying to speak them, and doesn't try to explain little things like why it suddenly teaches you how to they &#34;they&#34; differently for male and female groups, and so on.  Basically, don't try to use this system cold turkey or you're going to want to switch to Romanized, and you'll know deep down you're cheating yourself.<br /><br />Instead, begin with a workbook and flash card system like Japanese Hiragana and Katana (I recommend Timothy Stout's Japanese for Beginners) that you can motor through in a month, and then try this course.  You'll be amazed how much you can instantly read and retain.  I like how organized and clear the lessons are.  It feels like a very high quality education product overall. Solid.<br /><br />Cons: Rosetta Stone's pacing is weird though. It feels like you're reviewing the same material over and over for days, and can get boring fast. Luckily you can skip ahead as needed.  The speech recognition fails sometimes and will hurt your grades and pride :)"
1,"I bought this as a companion for use with a graphics tablet that I purchased. I have never used any software like this and in a few hours was drawing like a madman. The program responds well to pressure sensitivity and the COPIC brushes add a nice touch to the color options. The price was reasonable and the download and installation was painless. This program has already paid for itself.<br />I have recommended this to several friends.<br /><br />Pros: easy to learn how to use, great color choices, COPIC and customizable brushes<br />Cons: may run slow on older computers, screen can seem cluttered by pucks and palettes,"
0,"When making payments online it will change, on its own, the date of the payment. This has ocurred twice, that I haven't noticed, with large sums and I had to scramble to cover them. These payments weren't to be made for as long as 20 days so you can imagine the trouble. It also forgets the categoty assigned to the payment and, when corrected, may change the date or the amount of the payment. This was present in Quicken 2014, which also had some very bad issues, and was the reason I bought 2015. If no fix is offered soon, I may have to end my very long relationship with the program"
1,This was such an easy purchase compared to a lot of sites I've downloaded software from. And to top it off Amazon saves your product key for you should you ever have to reinstall.
0,"I bought this to replace my old reliable PaintShop Pro 4, which was perfectly suited to my needs, but won't run under Windows 7.<br /><br />I found that version X6 is everything that version 4 was not. It's huge, and takes forever to load. It's incredibly powerful, and has a steep learning curve.<br /><br />After I spent considerable time trying to figure out how to make it operate my scanner, I found that the 64-bit version only communicates with 64-bit drivers. My scanner turns out to have a 32-bit driver, despite the fact that it's only a couple of years old and comes from a major brand. To make PS.P. talk to it I'd have to install the 32-bit version -- which presumably would not talk to 64-bit drivers.<br /><br />When I realized what was happening with the scanner, I uninstalled and returned the program. I will not be using PS.P. again.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a light, fast paint program that's simple to use and easy to learn, find something else. (I chose Paint.NET, which is free and does most of what I want.) If you want an incredibly powerful paint program, even if it's huge and complex, you might as well get PhotoShop."
1,Was a long time user of Microsoft Money until Microsoft stopped. I switched to Quicken. This new version I like a lot more than the last two. I love the larger type. It's the only software for me now. Does it all. Good product. Strongly recommend updating...
0,Did not give me the state for free..........
0,"Very simple, user oriented interface, but lacks in encoding. When encoding from MKV or MP4 video quality seems to suffer when creating DVDs, and also had issues with the programming dropping frames (causing stuttering or jumping) with the same files.<br /><br />The program was widely suggested, but it seems that i will still be on the lookout for a better DVD authoring program."
0,"I've used many calendar programs and so I figured it would be easy to use this one.. I was wrong. It's very complicated with NO instructions. I'd click on options such as changing color of text.. a box would open and I'd choose the color, but it wouldn't change. Nothing worked. Waste of my money"
0,"Has become too expensive.  Reduced features.  Adding a second state nearly doubles the cost, and electronic filing is an additional cost."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have been using it since Feb 2015 . . when I was told in order to continue to use the 'online banking updates' that Q/Mac/2015 would be required to download transactions. Since then my product had had 5 'episodes' on non-connection with SunTrust Bank.  There is NO one at Intuit that will even admit there is a problem, although on their 'website forums' there are at least 15 people with the same 'error message' problem.  I have spent 4 hours on the phone, 7 'online chat sessions' of over an hour each, and tried every suggestion that they make. NOTHING WORKS and all Intuit will say is 'we are sorry for the inconvenience'."
1,"I was disappointed in the way it handle IRA withdrawal. It did not ask if it was contribution partial ...it just added the &*&$ on top of my income. Later, it ask ? About it, but it should stay on page and handle it to avoid confusion. Otherwise, it's a 4 stars."
1,"Great free software, but you have to manually update virus definitions. You will also have to continually choose to stay with the free version whenever the upgrade popup appears. Will be free forever if you do this, but remember it is only antivirus protection. This is not a total internet security suite. you will have to upgrade and pay something to get the full protection."
1,I would never be able to do my taxes on my own. Turbo Tax makes it so easy by walking you through each step and asking questions. It's smart and extremely helpful.
1,"This is such a wonderful, quick way to pay the Lady who actually runs my business. If I choose to give her a bonus, which I do for Thanksgiving and Christmas I can do it with proper taxes taken out  and don't  have to worry about it."
1,"I am amazed at the power of this application. But it is an Adobe product, so that should be no surprise; it's like Photoshop Jr. for digital images.<br />I'm taking a beginning photography class and this program was easy to install and, with minimal instruction, easy to begin using. It was very exciting to see what it could do with my very first set of DSLR images.<br />An accompanying guide would be well worth buying. I got Kelby's Lightroom 5, literally a step-by-step guide."
1,"This rating is not for the product (though I love it!) it is, rather, for the customer service that came with it.<br />I live in the middle of nowhere and my internet connectivity is sketchy. I had a boatload of difficulty downloading this product as the speed here is just so slow. After three tries I contacted Microsoft for help and boy did I get it... and fast... and it worked and everything has worked perfectly ever since.<br />So, awesome product but even more rare, unexpected and appreciated in this day of auto-replies, was the assistance I got from the various people I ended up talking with to get the job done."
1,Great
0,"I was traveling in an RV, my laptop had crashed and I had to buy a new one.  I didn't have my discs to reinstall Street Atlas 2013, so purchased a download of Street Atlas 2015.  It worked OK for my primary purpose of highway navigation, but the search function and the phone directory fail to activate.  I will probably get these functions operational eventually, but resent the extra time and hassle involved."
1,"Just renewed my 1-yr. subscription.<br /><br />Had problems with reoccurring Expiration notices popping up a different times.<br /><br />Took 2 tech support calls to correct the situation.<br /><br />If you want the &#34;Vault&#34;, this product does not include it.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with this product."
0,"I have been a  long time user of TurboTax and was very surprised this year.  Seems that they have decided to change their packages and charge for extra filing costs and state downloads also.  I went on their website and pocked the product they suggested.  After I purchased it, I discovered that they had dropped the free state download and were charging extra for this also.  Be careful when you choose.  I will need to think through more carefully next year.  Their price is now getting close to having your return completed by one of the big tax  preparers."
1,"Like others, I have gone back and forth with this and TT.  3rd year to use this product, since I opened new LLC. I'm halfway done with this year's return and so far everything works fine.  Took a little getting used to first time, since the business part is a separate program.  Not sure if they made any improvements, but previously I had to do the business part separate and then manually enter some information on the other &#34;regular&#34; program.  Still better than TT."
0,"The federal version worked well, but the state version had major problems with one of my w-2s ( it was unable to recognize a code - wtf??).<br />I had to wait online+ on the phone for hours to get to TT support.  One person<br />helped, the second had no clue.  Hit or miss.  The problem finally got resolved, but with way too much effort.  The state version is NOT free to file - RIPOFF alert!<br />Plus, to just print it for mail filing is a major pain in the a--.  They make it difficult so you will just pay them to e file.  Not happy."
1,Great product... Student version installation process is a little confusing and you must provide proof to adobe... Once that was complete... It was a breeze :)
0,"The description mentions that you can use this software to prepare your return and e-file it. What they fail to mention is that when you try to e-file, they expect an additional $17.95 to do so! But wait, that's not all...E-filing for individuals who earn below a certain income are entitled to e-file free of charge. I did so, using free software online from Turbo Tax. The very same software I purchased for $19.99. Save your money. Turbo Tax Basic is available free online. There is absolutely no difference, except that it allows you to e-file without extorting another $17.95."
0,"It appears Quicken for Mac 2015 does not even come close to Quicken Deluxe for Windows.  I have uninstalled it, requested a refund from Amazon, and will reluctantly stay with Quicken Essentials, as much as I dislike that program."
1,This is truly a fascinating piece of software and can easily be the framework of future oracle hybrid type applications. I advise the user to read at least the first part of the guide before entering the arena of &#34;The Book of Decisions&#34; (TBD).<br />Concepts you've find inside TBD are rich and have depth. The developer/author has made every effort to guide and support the user through the &#34;game&#34;.<br />Hope the development of the app continues!
1,"I susally throw a $10 contribution. The suite does everything I want it to, although I wish I could find a network template.  I'm not a heavy word processor guy and it allows me to do just about every formatting trick I learned back in high school typing class."
1,"Great product, at a great price. You can't beat Amazon prices!!! A+ A+ A+"
0,Not for advanced Office users who are trying to learn the changes to the new software.
0,"The cost and confusion have both increased from previous years.  For years, I used to be able to do what I needed with basic--even though I filed schedule C.  Now it appeared I need to purchase deluxe.  Then, part way through working with deluxe, it pops-up a warning telling me I need to shell out $40 more for home and business in order to e-file. Presumably, some aspect of my schedule C entries (which I haven't verified in detail yet) triggered this \\""no longer can do\\"" warning.  I may be able to e-file eventually, as it appears to have tried to set up my car for depreciation--even though I'm only interested in business mileage deduction. We'll see.<br /><br />I WILL say this: Intuit has created a very confusing situation between the different products and different ways the online vs. offline versions work and the forms they support.  I'll definitely be taking a hard look at an alternative next year.<br /><br />Yes, I've read through the other reviews and ongoing comments... whatever a person may say, it just doesn't make sense for the product offerings to trip up so many folks in subtle ways causing us to have to mess around and spend still MORE time on taxes than we already do--one of the reasons we purchase tax preparation software in the first place.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of February 5, 2015<br /><br />I received the email offer from Turbotax today offering $25 cash back to try and make up for this blunder.  However, there are some restrictions on the offer which exclude my situation: 1) You had to file last year using TurboTax Deluxe; 2) you had to have upgraded to Premier or Home and Business to obtain the missing tax forms; 3) you have to have (already) filed you 2014 return.  I fail condition #1 (I used Basic for previous years since it had everything I needed) and condition #3 (I've calculated my preliminary taxes for 2014, but haven't filed yet).  Failing any of the three conditions, it appears I'm ineligible for a refund!  So, because I read about this years form omissions ahead, started with Deluxe instead of my normal Basic, then was forced to upgrade to Home and Business and I haven't yet filed my 2014 return, I have two strikes against me and no refund applies!<br /><br />Worse than that, I originally paid about $33 for Basic last year, ended up paying $55 for Deluxe, and then was forced to swallow an additional $44 'upgrade' for Home and Business. So I paid $66 more this year than what I had to pay last year to accomplish the same tax return!  And this really gets my goat: even if I would have qualified to meet their oddball restrictions, I WOULD ONLY RECEIVE $25 BACK --which doesn't even match the $44 Home and Business upgrade cost I paid (not to mention the additional $22 I paid to start with Deluxe rather than Basic).<br /><br />In short, their \\""cash back offer\\"" is bogus on two fronts: 1) goofy restrictions which don't match the real situation of customers like me; 2) the amount of the refund doesn't come close to the actual hit we took in extra cost for 2014.d with Deluxe instead of my normal Basic, then was forced to upgrade to Home and Business and I haven't yet filed my 2014 return, I have two strikes against me and no refund applies!    Worse than that, I originally paid about $33 for Basic last year, ended up paying $55 for Deluxe, and then was forced to swallow an additional $44 'upgrade' for Home and Business. So I paid $66 more this year than what I had to pay last year to accomplish the same tax return!

In short, their \\""cash back offer\\"" is bogus on two fronts: 1) goofy restrictions which don't match the real situation of customers like me; 2) the amount of the refund doesn't come close to the actual hit we took in extra cost for 2014."
0,Intuit has managed to turn this into the biggest piece of crap ever. They took a nice clean product back from the DOS days and every year made it worse and worse. To add insult to injury Amazon will not let me return it.<br /><br />This will be my last purchase EVER from Intuit and from Amazon!
1,I have used this numerous times and it always makes game-playing and chatting more efficient.
1,extremely reliable and easy to navigate
0,Don't download this it is not free.  Will analysis for free but cost $25 to do anything. What a waste.
1,"For me, this is the best. Tested many programs like this, but I thought this was simpler to use, more useful and cheaper. Worth."
1,Turbo Tax is such a great product!  Price was good too!  Thanks.
1,"I was advised by my two brothers to go with Norton 360 as my security on my new laptop.I was told by a friend to check<br />out Amazon for speed and price.They were all right! I have and will sugguest the same to everyone in the future.I must say, Amazon has always been great to deal with in every way."

1,"Features such as identifying headings and being able to go directly to those headings, as well as picking up where you left off in a document, are wonderful time-saving elements."
1,I have used Norton before with no problems. That is why I decided to go with Norton again because of results.
1,I had to purchase this for the Little League in our town to keep up with their records that someone else started.  I haven't really used it but was easy to get downloaded and the files transferred over.
1,"Same great product, same great results.  Processed my taxes with no trouble and already got my refunds in the bank!"
1,Love Elements. It takes a while to use it effectively but once you figure out the basics it becomes more intuitive

0,incredibly complicated process for downloading the product key after purchase.  DO  NOT BUY it in this form.  Order the disks instead.
1,"I've been using HitFilm since the first version was released, and I have nothing but great things to say about this 3rd release. They actually reduced the price for Hitfilm 3, which is crazy considering how much more powerful this version is. I'm a Filmmaker/editor, and I use HitFilm for most of my Visual Effects, compositing, and motion graphics needs.<br /><br />What I most like about using Hitfilm is how much they simplify the process of creating VFX and compositing. While some other software have a very steep learning curve, and require a lot of extra plugins (thus more money) to complete tasks, HitFilm comes with a lot of features built-in. The particle engine was already amazing, but now it's on a whole other level. I honestly believe it rivals similar plugins like Particular. The ability to import and use 3D models is also a great feature, and it's now even better with Hitfilm 3.<br /><br />I'm trying to keep this review short, so I won't go into details about all the features included ;)<br /><br />The video editing features have been majorly upgraded also. Better features and a better UI now makes HitFilm's editing side something that can match up against other NLEs. I don't use much of the video editing side of HitFilm since I'm already a Premiere Pro user, but for compositing and VFX, HitFilm is my go-to software. It has most of the options I need, the learning curve isn't steep, and the price is just amazing!<br /><br />I can do more for less. What's not to love?"
0,"Federal was just as expected, but disappointed that State E-file is not included.  It had been included in past years."
1,I tried out Quicken for Mac 2015 and iBank5 at the same time.  Both did what I needed to do which was keep track of 3 bank accounts and 4 credit cards.  I choose QfM  2015 because of its clean Mac-like interface and because automatic download was free. IBank would have worked but I would pay $60/year for automatic download. With QfM 2015 everything always is right there in front of me on an uncluttered interface. So far I have no complaints. Others with more complex finances may have different opinions.
1,"It does what it was supposed to do in a straightforward manner.  The only negative I have is that they charge $19.95 to eFile the state return, when the state (KS) has an eFile site that is free. (Guess which I use?)  I also wish that they had kept the TaxCut moniker, but they changed it a couple years back, so that probably won't change."
1,Excellent program! Use it every year...make it a part of your yearly tax process. Purchasing from Amazon is the best way to go.
1,"When I enter split transactions, the data entry routine can cause erroneous information  to be intered.  This is because the cursor does not go all the way to the amount field to allow intuitive data entry."
0,"The digital download worked fine.  Maps took just over an hour to update.  However, traveling in NJ, PA, and CO, the maps didn't lead us to the right place.  For instance, clicking on a Costco in NJ led us to a gravel road in the middle of a forest with no Costco in sight.  It happened again in downtown Philadelphia and in a couple of places in Colorado.  Overall though, I did notice updates to newly developed shopping areas, etc."
1,It was very good and it served my needs. Thanks you
0,"Although the system requirements for this software state that it will run on PowerPC Macs G3 and newer, as long as they have at least OS 10.5.8, you can't download the software here at Amazon because Amazon's downloader only works with Intel-based Macs.  In other words, although the underlying software is compatible with PowerPC Macs, Amazon itself is not.  If you have a PowerPC Mac, don't waste your money trying to get this software here."
0,"It was about what I expected.  A clumsy program that did what I needed it to do.  At least I hope it did....won't know for sure until the audit window closes.  It imported brokerage data, but the imported data required a lot of massaging.  The whole process of verifying / correcting imported data could be made a lot less cumbersome.  If you trade a lot of stocks / options, it might just be easier to enter the data yourself.  It found a credit for a new HE A/C I installed.  I would have missed that if I had done the taxes manually.  I was going to give 3 stars, but now that I remember the A/C credit, I'll give 4.  But, wait a minute.  I live in Florida and Florida doesn't have a state income tax.  I'm annoyed that I had to buy the package including \\""state\\"".  I'm also annoyed that the software isn't smart enough to know Florida doesn't have a state income tax and it kept nagging me about it.  Back to 3 stars."
0,"Unfortunately, it took a few tries to install the software over the old Norton, but at least my LAN is covered. Otherwise, I'd given it a five."
1,So simple easy to use
1,Have used this program over the years. Always provides what I need for an S Corporation and my personal taxes.
0,"I feel deceived and ripped off by this product.  I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years to do my taxes.  This year they change the program ELIMINATING the ability to input simple stock capital gain data without a  costly upgrade to the next level program (Premier).  The deception is that you don't realized the change until you are so committed that you have no choice but to buy the upgrade.  On top of that, had I known I had to have &#34;Premier&#34; I would have bundled with &#34;QUICKEN&#34; and taken advantaged of their rebate offer.  Other than this deceptive price increase, the program works well as usual."
1,"I was skeptical that a downloadable version of office could really be an excellent program, but I was totally wrong. This is absolutely the best version yet. With one adjustment, it works like lightning, is bug-free, and has wonderful new features. The one adjustment is to go into the advanced setup and turn off graphics acceleration.If you don't, many of your games will run very slowly. Just uncheck the box and restart any of the programs: it will run even faster without the acceleration, and all your games will hum along as before.<br /><br />Among the new features, two stand-out: the app store and the spell checker. The app store gives you free access to such programs as The Merriam Webster Dictionary and Legal Zoom Forms. It feels as though you own an iPhone. The add-ins work flawlessly and there are so many that it is absolutely fun to find them. The spell checker in Word solves so many problems that it is worth the money by itself. Not only does it work in the whole document instead of that maddening small window of the past, but it also has a superior ability to find whole words that have accidentally been split by commas or semi-colons. I actually saw it find &#34;did;nt&#34; and offer the correct replacement -- something it was never able to do in the past.<br /><br />As far as the subscription &#34;tether&#34; - well, if $100 brings all of this, then I welcome it. Every year. Updates come in automatically and smoothly.<br /><br />One caveat: if you have previously added-in classic menu toolbars in your older versions, disable them. If you haven't, Office 365 will try to use them and then be unable to do so when it starts up. it will search for a way for several minutes before any program, such as Word or Excel, starts. You must go into the setup to add-ins for EACH program and uncheck them (COM add-ins). It is a royal pain. So, disable all those classic menu add-ins before downloading.<br /><br />Other than that, a superb product, well worth more than the$100 price."
1,"OK, I deleted my last review and I realize I was  impatient. Here's what went wrong, I say that because everything is working<br />perfect, no freezes,stalls, nothing, Here is what I did that may help u with this product. Just read Amazon's help guide.  On<br />failed downloads, delete everything, even stuff in the libraries. Check all drives, folders, everything, delete it including recycle<br />bin. Re-install everything,separate folders for amazon stuff, from CyberLink. If u use Firefox, use the 32 bit Java install. I deleted my Adobe Flashplayer and just allow it to play stuff when I need it for now. Oh one more thing watch exactly where these files are going if u have Windows on a ssd. Browse and put it on your internal harddrive. I opted out of all the trial software. That's it, Happy Video Editing."
0,"Long time Quicken user, I love it, but I am trying to go backwards to 2013 because 2014 has so many bugs and weird changes. If you haven't purchased 2014 I would wait until they've fixed the bugs. I've never had a problem with 2013."
1,Easy to use. Got my full return.
0,horrible download. no chance to find out how good it is because of the 24hr download that didn't work
1,Needs to work faster.  Can really slow down your browser especially streaming video. Windows updates seem to take twice as long.
0,"You suck. Already signed up with H&R Block for next year, will not ever buy another TurdboTax product again. You don't change your software that dramatically and jack up the price without telling us before we buy your product, you jerked me around and ripped me off! I spent $40 for the deluxe that had everything I have ever needed in the past and then make me buy the $80 software just to file my taxes, that's $120.00, that is dishonest."
0,"This is a stripped down version and in order to get the &#34;Full Meal Deal&#34; you have to go to their website, pay an additional $29.95 and then maybe, just maybe, you can do something with the program. As is, I am unable to do any You Tube download. I can't even download a video from my own You Tube channel. It refuses to analyze thus no download."
0,Not happy with changes made from last year with no notafiation
0,"First,  I have to say I didn't want to upgrade to Quicken 2010 three years ago either,  however, just like this year if I wanted to continue using the download tranaction feature of the product I had previously purchased and was working fine for my needs,  I was forced once again to purchase an upgraded version of Quicken.  Now the one feature I care about (transaction downloads) takes 10 times as long to complete as Quicken 2010 did.  Everything else....moving between accounts, screens, processing/accepting transactions,  report generation seems sluggish as well.<br /><br />I guess I'll start looking for ways to convert my Quicken files to be consumed by some other financial management software."
0,"Like others here, totally frustrated that it changed so much from prior years and costs more for less- AND to add insult to injury because of the fraud flags re state tax filing and TurboTax issues, I am still waiting on my state refund. I won't be back."
0,"Why do I need to continue updating a program that worked fine enough?  I use Quicken for clients and if they upgrade or switch, I am required to upgrade.  The product works fine but I'd like it to respond faster and provide more reports."
1,"I am hooked on Norton 360.  I have been a loyal user for years.  Have tried other security software when I had more than 3 PC's in the house, McAfee, CA and others.  Most were annoying, bogged the computer down and a pain to use.  Absolutely love the Identity Safe product.  With all the passwords you need to remember in life this is an absolute lifesaver....best part of the whole product.  The backup amount, 2 GB isn't worth putting in the program, but I don't use it anyway.  But everything else does a great job.<br /><br />Now as far as purchasing do not use Norton's renewal site.  They will try and sell it to you for $80...full price.  Yet you can go to there home site and buy it for $30 less.....go figure that one out.  But went on Amazon and paid $13 less than that and absolutely no problems with the download or installation.  Last year Norton's ran a promo, but this year none so definitely worth shopping around.  Installed it easily on three PC's....running perfectly."
1,I especially liked the way it allowed me<br />to clean up my browsers after some<br />un helpful program had taken over
1,"One of the cheapest blu-ray players on the market and works like a charm. Plays blu-ray movies flawlessly and comes with many video options. At first I thought it wasn't working because it said it could not read the blu ray disk, but I then realized there was an issue with my video card. I got the video card fixed and now I can finally watch my favorite movies (new and old) in Blu-Ray. I'm practically glued to my computer now. Plus, you have the option of automatically updating the player so it can read and convert the latest codecs. No need to keep on buying newer versions like other players out there. Great player at a great price."
1,Uninstalled the existing version and re installed the software from Amazon; entered the key that was in Amazon account worked as charm. Saved $40
1,awesome and taking care of itself well.
0,Schedule D removed from deluxe
0,"Warning: This version only efiles Federal Taxes, State Taxes are an additional $19.95 to efile.    This is our second year using TurboTax.    Pros: picked up last years information making things go a little more quickly.  Reminded me of many deductions and credits that I had previously set aside.  Was able to, relatively quickly, review our taxes filing jointly and separately.    Cons: had issues about halfway through the first time.  While filling out the form, the blanks would no longer accept keyboard input.  Worked fine after restarting computer.  While the product title says that it is Federal + state + efile, Federal efile was free while TurboTax wanted to charge $19.95 to file state.  I used the chat help and this is what the agent explained to me.  Can still print out the state forms and mail them in for free."
1,Been a long time quicken user.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Love it!
0,"I have used TurboTax for the last several years, and each year, there is exactly one form that is keeping me from using a cheaper version of TurboTax.<br /><br />One year, it was having an HSA. I could have filed with TurboTax Basic except for needing a single form (8889) causing me to need Deluxe instead.<br /><br />The next year, it's a single stock sale causing me to need Premier instead of Deluxe. Is this by design?<br /><br />I think intuit needs a better business model. Perhaps allowing you to buy single form add-ons for $1-2 each, instead of one form being a $20-40 upgrade to the next TT tier. Or just having only two versions of TurboTax: Home (includes ALL non-business forms), and Business (includes everything else).<br /><br />Hopefully next year's TurboTax releases have a better strategy. If not, I will probably try out H&R Block's tax prep software."
0,"Difficult to use.  Haven't used quicken in like 15 years or more.  This product seems to have a much steeper learning curve to use, and I am computer and tech savvy and still haven't figured this product out.  Seems as though every function I try to do I have to research on google for an hour to figure it out. I estimate I will need 40 hours to get familiar with this program...and I don't want to invest that much time in it.  The very basic quicken I used many years ago was a much more useful product to me."
0,Extremely slow. 2007 Quicken much better and more versital
1,TurboTax has done the job for me for many years and this year is no exception. I didn't use any of the forms that all the hubub was about. Being used to the format I do very little of the guided interview but it's there if needed. I always think the state filing price is too high so I fill it out in TurboTax and then transfer the numbers to our state's free filing site. Another successful tax year.
0,Didn't work well
1,Works very well
1,Pretty good
0,"In my opinion, Quicken 2013 is useless. It does not allow you to track a paycheck in the budget.  I asked Intuit about this problem and was told they recognize the problem but do not have a fix for it yet nor did they know when the problem would be fixed.  The version of Quicken I was using is no longer supported.  I asked if I could get a complimentary version of the last one (other than 2013) that was supported until the problem was fixed and was told no. Because of this experience I intend to never buy an Intuit product including Turbo Tax again."
0,"Why purchase this version when Outlook is completely useless?<br /><br />I'm done trying to troubleshoot Outlook 2013's issues. I have wasted hours of my otherwise productive time.<br /><br />This came with my Microsoft Office 2013 download and it is worthless with IMAP email. It sometimes works, mostly doesn't. It will hang in the send/receive mode for hours without doing anything. If it feels like it, new emails will be loaded instantly. Usually they take about an hour to actually arrive, even though they are on the server, your phone, your web based log in.<br /><br />There is a bug in the program that they are unwilling to fix with Windows 8/8.1<br /><br />Windows live mail works fine same with other email programs so it's on Microsoft's end.<br /><br />As others mentions, you need sunglasses to view, too bright, too white too ugly.  The other programs seems to work fine, the redesign is ugly but they work as they should."
0,Great Product as always from Norton just hate the pop ups and notices all the time even when nothing is wrong with the computer.
1,Works just fine
0,It's been over two weeks and have not even received it yet.  So how can I even rate it.  Not Good.
0,"The registration process is ridiculously arcane. If you're not an IT, get ready for some grief- the trial version works perfectly, but the Norton site makes me jump through so many flaming hoops that the SPCA would shut them down if I was a dog. I had an account already (I've been using Symantec on my PC's without issues for more than five years, though that may now change)- I have a password, I have the product key- but I can't get the copy of Norton Mobility on my phone to recognize that it's now paid for. Look... I recognize the fact that Android is not Windows- but for crying out loud, it's (sort of) open source- and there's a lot of documentation out there. Google WANTS people to use Android- so, is this growing pains, a failure to hire people who can do the coding for this project, or what? Yeah, I'm frustrated... and the support process is a joke in poor taste. I lost four hours to this today- and while I had intended to buy a copy for my wife's phone too, well... probably not at this point."
1,I have no complaints.  Avast appears to do what it says it will. I have not encountered a serious problem since it was installed.
1,"why is it such a pain to activate office these days? amazon did great selling it to me, but boy it sucks getting m$ to activate it. so many email addresses, such a PITA for a tech to manage everyones emails and lics."
0,"After reading the reviews, I ignorantly thought I could design a rudimentary floor plan for my new home to show the Architect my ideas.  Man, was I wrong.  This software is convoluted to an extent I would have to get a degree to use it.  I called Amazon and was told since it was a download, they couldn't help me, although the reviews &#34;Amazon&#34; had on this product were completely false.<br /><br />After ten years or more of &#34;loving&#34; Amazon, I now will seek other online vendors because I have lost trust in the Bezos!  To me he is now Jeff Bozo.  Watch your stock price, this is what happens as a non mortar new idea becomes mature."
1,I downloaded Quicken to replace Microsoft Money. Money is no longer supported and was always quirky. This software is a major improvement.
1,"Fine result, imported last year's return from TaxCut. Not quite as easy to use as TaxCut and TurboTax, but close enough--and a lot cheaper. I;ll use it again."
0,"This product looks ok but it was the only software I have installed recently and my adware program has just reported 15 instances of spyware, all labelled  relevantknowledge. [I have removed them and uninstalled  pc updater.] It also installed itself for automatic startup on switch on  and re-installed the auto start after I had removed it. Steer clear."
0,"Synch to your mobile may be of great benefit to you.  To me it has been a \\""nice to have\\"" feature but not of any real benefit. Not worth the $$ and you can't upgrade...you have to buy the complete new version which does (of course) import your old quicken data."
1,A must have to keep track of your finances.  The mobile app is something they added this year and it is a great add on to Quicken.
1,The best and most accurate tax product who can be trusted. I have been a customer for our 10+ years. The worksheets provided and transmitted to the IRS always expedites the refund process and does not raise any red flags.  I appreciate Turbo Tax's Accountants and Tax Advisors. They have helped me through some difficult questions and made everything seem so simple. I would be lost without Turbo Tax.
1,"This is a product that I have used for many years, fantastic for keeping your finances at your finger tips and seeing how you are spending or saving your money.  I always reorder from Amazon because they offer the best price on the product."
1,"This year, and I've been using TT for about 15 years or so, I found that there were cases where instructions were not quite on target or scanty.  I wish I could be more specific, but I will say this; when I got to talk to someone (the numbers for HELP should be much more obvious!) they helped me in seconds and I was on my way. One other thing: one should NOT be charged for electronic submissions until the return is ACCEPTED by the US or State agency.  I had to file for 2 refunds for those fees due to submission failures.  Again, this was the very first year that I experienced ANY problems with TT and I will use it again next year!"
0,Terrible! One problem after another trying to download the product! Very frustrating trying to get from one problem to the next.<br />BE VERY CAREFUL! If you call Amazon for a refund they will tell you it is not their problem! I have been a long time Amazon customer and have had terrific experience with Amazon until now.
0,Introduced quite a few step backs from the 2012 version I had used previously. Strange payee names pop up when I download credit card transactions. I understand the bugs are being hunted down and eliminated.
0,Don't waste your money!  Everything you can do with this program you can do with windows admin tools for free.  Scam does not recover partitions or data.
1,Norton Antivirus. Excellent product does not slow down the computer and gives the basic protection which is good enough for the average user who is not interested in phorn sites. I love Amazon.
1,"... because I've been completely satisfied with my free avira AV (which i've been using for eons), and which has been nothing short of steller, but after \\""X'ing\\"" all the annoying pop-ups day after day, I decided to invest in a reputable and reliable AV software... Norton IS seemed to be the best rated and fit the bill! Norton is not as sensitive as my avira was, which i'm not sure is a good thing or bad thing, but so far, it seems to be doing its job without hogging up all my resources/memory, which is one thing I really like about it! All in all, seems like a good investment!"
1,Used this product for years and have been very happy with it.  This year's price is exceptional compared to years past.  Never had a security issue of any type on my computer using it.  Nice being able to download and install immediately instead of waiting for a shipment.
0,"So this is only the 3rd year I've done my own taxes and I can say for sure this has easily been the worst year for hidden extra fees and just all around disappointment.  It's been stressful to the point where I really wish I just paid a consultant to do these for me. I'm young and stupid, I don't read everything I should apparently in the fine print.  Seriously disappointed in myself and Turbotax."
1,"I used to love Turbo Tax, but since they screwed all the deluxe users I am going to go to Tax Act next year.  I understand that it is just as good and Intuit has gotten too big for it's own good.  I have used it for 10 years but I am mad and ready for a change."
1,There is nothing like it - Off the Hook!
0,Not compatible with Windows 10.
1,Program works well!
1,Transitioned from Quicken Essentials.<br /><br />Has worked very well for managing my accounts. Am very pleased with all the features. A very good product. Highly recommend it.
0,"Software is OK, but if you ever need to reinstall it - more than 2 or 3 times - they will freeze your key, rendering the software useless unless you buy another key. Very suspect policy!"
1,"The training is very well done, I also have the Infinite Skills training package for 3DS Max 2012, which is absolutely outstanding.<br /><br />Compared to the 3DS MAX 2012 training set from Infinite Skills, this one seems to be more out of order in terms of how I would have expected the lessons to be put together.  Perhaps that is because Carrara is more often used for creating 3D fantasy artwork stills instead of 3D animations, even though it does both very well.  The pace of the training is fairly quick, so you'll be hitting the pause button a lot, especially if you'll be following along with Carrara as you got through the lessons (the proper only way to actually learn to use the product).<br /><br />Though the training is good for this wonderful and exciting product, and the instructor did do a great job, I did find a bit of a distraction in the instructor's speech pattern.  His knowledge as an instructor is outstanding, however, and that's the main point.<br /><br />Even Carrara's interface can get a little overwhelming to new users when the project gets complex, so there are a few things that I wish were covered in more detail.  Regardless, I feel that all the basics were covered.<br /><br />So to keep this simple, this training is very complete, and will teach you all the basics along with a lot of fantastic tips and tricks from the instructor's vast experience.  I believe this training set is a great product that I would recommend to anyone.  I feel it is well worth the $99 I paid for the product."
1,Nice
1,I've had the full version (premier) for a few months. It was offered at a major discount during the free trial. So far no complaints.
0,really wish there was a way I good get my money back.  just purchased and downloaded this today and it has crashed so many times that I finally just uninstalled it.  a terrible waste of money for me.
1,Did everything I needed.
0,"I am a realtor and after incorporating I just needed a program to keep track of my income, expenses and my paycheck (also set up with intuit). I own a Mac and I am very agile with all the programs. This Quickbook software is extremely complicated to set up! You have to speak with different help agents for hours (if not days) before linking 2 simple things: your intuit Payroll and your bank.<br />Different support agents made me set up separate quickbook and I had to redo everything a few days later!<br />To this day they still don't know where I should enter the transactions that were not recorded on my bank the first 2 months of 2014....<br />I will not recommend."
1,"I used Quicken for DOS a long time ago, and then moved to Microsoft Money. When Money discontinued, I went back to Quicken and even upgraded to 2009, but had difficulty in setting up budgets, along with other things. However, I did manage to setup the mortgage, credit cards, other debts and continued using it through 2010 when I bought my Mustang. Afterwards, I stopped using it and switched to Android and then attempted to keep up with my finances on the Ipad. I had already been keeping up with the finances on a spreadsheet and somehow wanted the look of the spreadsheet to be in a fiance software.<br /><br />Quicken 2013 came out and with that, the promise of a mobile version. I immediately bought the 2013 version and was willing to enter a whole year and a half of data when I thought better of it and just told Quicken to Skip payments. I was relieved when it suggested that the principal of each account would automatically be updated, and did so correctly! Now, i do not have to enter a year's worth of data.<br /><br />I tried setting up the mobile and to this day, still have issues with the balance and updating. There is a lot that needs to be done with the mobile version, but like everything else, once more people use it and the demand rises, I am sure Intuit will make the needed improvements to make it workable. I have not called them for technical support on the mobile issue, but will once I go through the software one more time.<br /><br />I tried budgets again and was not really happy with it. However, I did like the spreadsheet view. After struggling and giving up with the budgets, I did go through all of my accounts, cleaned them up and closed out the accounts I no longer have and the loans that were already paid off. Next, I updated the Bills Reminders and after working with Bill Reminders, I saw how I could use this as a budget tool instead of the actual budget! The only thing that Bill Reminder doesn't have reminders for is... EXPENSES. I think this would be really sweet. It keeps expenses separate, though, but only after an expense has been made. SO, what I did is rethought how I do my finances and came up with a simple solution...<br /><br />Instead of trying to budget $120 a month for gas and $200 a month for groceries... I setup Bill Reminders for Gas at $25 per week and groceries at $50 per week.  This means that instead of filling up every 3 weeks or so, I fill up every week. This will give me a good idea of what I really spend on gas each week. The cool thing is, when i enter the grocery expense or the gas expense, I skip the Bill entry for that week and just enter directly into my checking account the entries. This way, it shows up as an expense.<br /><br />Since I got the software, I have improved my finances ten-fold and now making wiser decisions on where my money should go. I am using the savings goal part of the software to help set aside money for projects. I am better organized with fiances and will continue to stay on top of things. I am more energized to pay off debt rather than incur new debt. The program runs solid and as long as you continue to make backups and store the backups in two or three different places, if you ever have an issue with the software or other problems, you can always restore the backup or do repairs to the database. Intuit folks are quite capable and able to help. Despite running solid, there are bugs in this software but nothing that would prevent you from using the software on a consistent basis. If you have issues and problems, verbalize them to Intuit so they can work out the problems. The 2013 version has paid for itself the first week I got it and I am looking forward to next year's in hopes that they will have adapted to windows tablet style of input.<br /><br />For me, I use my Apple Ipad to remote into my windows 8 desktop and working with Quicken in this manner is not the easiest! However, for &#34;viewing&#34; and looking at reports, or doing planning, it is fine.Next version, I would like to do actual entries from my Ipad.<br /><br />Remember! Always make backups and use the bill reminder to handle the bulk of your budgeting. Customize the home screen to give you the perfect snapshot of your finances. Work with the software to make it work for you.Next version, I would like to do actual entries from my Ipad.<br /><br />Remember! Always make backups and use the bill reminder to handle the bulk of your budgeting. Customize the home screen to give you the perfect snapshot of your finances.

0,nothing special it worked.
0,"Not bad, need to be able to download big chunks at a time and not limited or having to download everything, which gives errors every time."
1,"for a free antivirus its the best. has great features that come with the free program and you can upgrade to include additional features if you choose to do so. at present i have no need to do so. however, if that does become necessary, i will not hesitate to choose avast pro."
1,so much better than essentials for mac
1,"The software was as advertised, and was also for an extremely great price. Downloading it and installing it on my computers was straitforward and seamless in operation. It certainly met my needs very well."
1,"For years I overpaid for Norton and wrestled with updates and manual facilitation of the application. I purchased PCMatic over a year ago and I haven't had to think about the speed or security of my PC since! Without reservation, I highly recommend PCMatic."
0,Q14 will not display properly on a MBPro retina running win7 under parallels.  Very disappointing as I have owned quicken since 1992.  Didn't have this problem with Q13
1,Quickbooks 2012 for the Mac is the latest version of Quickbooks that is available for the Macintosh.  It is completely a Mac application through and through and works as you would expect.  The interface is intuitive and very easy to get around.  You can make professional looking invoices very simply.  The search facility has been re-written to allow for almost limitless search possibilities.
1,"at least with TurboTax, I know it will be a consistent experience from year to year.  This is no different.  It makes taxes as bearable as it can be, and what more can you ask for?  It installed cleanly, it imported last year's tax info easily, and got me through my initial draft of my 2011 taxes without too much pain.  My favorite feature of TurboTax is not a well known one - the ability to have it create a new W-4 for withholdings, based on your actual estimated taxes for the next year.  With the information it has about my tax situation, I've been able to withhold a much lower amount each paycheck, giving me a virtual raise throughout the year!"
1,"i did everyone in my houses taxes, they pull from the year before so i only needed to add so much information"
0,Bought this for a computer that I returned to Apple. Tried to get refund but was told there are no returns on downloaded products. Bummer.
1,"I always TurboTax to file my state and federal tax, and the result is always great!<br />Amazon is great at offering this software at lowest price possible. I'll come back and buy it next year, too!"
1,"First off, let me mention that this was my first year using TurboTax or any tax software for that matter.  Before I was using a CPA that has been doing my family's taxes for years.<br /><br />Using TurboTax I ended up with a refund over three times what I got last year while having very similar financial circumstances.  I will never go back to a &#34;professional&#34; again.  Also, I'm buying last year's version so I can submit an amended return for 2012 and get all the stuff that the CPA missed!<br /><br />What's great about this program is its simple interface and intuitive design that assumes little to no knowledge on your part, and offers plenty of ways to expand your knowledge along the way (through the use of in-program help links and links that send you to their website for longer explanations).<br /><br />What I like most:<br />1. Can interface with websites like ipay and import your W-2 automatically<br />2. Has all the calculations and formulae pre-programed so you just enter in the info, no calculations necessary (which can reduce errors)<br />3. Asks you about everything you could possibly deduct or get credit for.  This amounts to a fair amount of clicking through multiple pages of irrelevant suggestions to you, but this is how I got back so much larger of a refund.  There were quite a few credits/deductions I never knew I qualified for, from small things here and there to a few major ones.<br />4. When different options may lead to different amounts back it finds the one that's best for you automatically but will let you override it should you wish.<br />5.  If you want to do anything manually you have the option, just click &#34;forms&#34; in the top right corner.<br /><br />What I didn't like (why 4 stars and not 5)<br />1. The extra $20 hidden charge for using e-file for your state taxes.  You're already paying extra for the state part of the program I don't really know why this is here.  Obviously you can just avoid the fee by sending your state taxes the old fashioned way (which is what I did) but I wish it they were more upfront about this slightly hidden fee.<br />2.  The deal with Amazon.com for turning part of your Federal refund into a gift card +10% from Amazon seemed nice since I was going to get myself a little something anyway but right before I'm finishing that part, another hidden charge comes up.  &#34;You must purchase TurboTax Plus for this feature.&#34; which is $40.  Needless to say I opted out of the &#34;bonus&#34; giftcard.<br /><br />Odd hidden charges aside  that are both avoidable, this is still a beautifully designed program that I would recommend to anyone with a relatively simple financial situation.  I can't speak if this is appropriate for business owners are people with diverse investments,​ but for the most of us I think it's worth it.xes the old fashioned way (which is what I did) but I wish it they were more upfront about this slightly hidden fee.<br />2.

1,Turbo is the best
1,Such a great program
1,I have never used a program like this one before. I need to bring my company up to date and off of note pads. This was so easy to use that i had it figured out and sending estimates and invoices in about 30min.
1,This was a must have for my writing experience!
1,"Amazon's price $30 lower than any other place. I have used Norton Security for years and really appreciate the new Norton Security with backup. With 10 devices allowable on this key how can you not provide protection at a reasonable price? I have used Norton 360 in the past and at this point really don't see a big difference if at all. Works great and transferred all my password information from the old to the new program without a hitch. Highly Recommend this Internet Security with Backup (to the cloud). I know from the past, my hard drive crashed in December 2014, I was able to download my filed from the cloud on a new hard drive without any problem...don't mess with trying to do it yourself, set the program rules and let the system do the rest."
1,Easy to follow instructions to download and was able to begin using immediately.  Fixed all my issues from the outdated version I was using previously.
1,"I have been a quicken user for well over a decade.. I also hoped that if you applied the theory that says, you take the best and the worst reviews off and look at the ones in the middle it would give a true picture.. I took the leap. I was 101% satisfied with the 2012 version. Zero issues. The things on my wish list were in 2013 (mobile being one of them) I was pleased to see it worked! however.. that pleasure quickly turned dark the 2nd time I tried to sync with the bank. what previously worked now gets an error..The odd part is that the mobile, by gosh, still gets updated (they really fixed it) however the quicken accounts on the desktop do not.. I have tried various conflagurations of fixes and I have yet to call Intuit or my bank.. I will continue at it and if I can solve the dreaded OL-220 error..    *** UPDATE ***  I spent several hours deep diving in the technical aspects of the express web connect..If you were a 2012 user and your bank downloads worked until you upgraded.. you need to read my article in the intuit forums.. while there may be other less obvious issues in the product, it is now functioning exactly as good as 2012 with the added features, as I expected..    [...]"
1,I run the program on a 64 bit machine with Windows 8 and the transition couldn't have been smoother with the Quicken logo sitting stately on my Start Page..........I highly recommend you go for it......
1,"I just began my tax return, got to the end with no errors reported; then the audit risk calculation returns back with a page stating that it found a \\""slightly elevated audit risk due to 1 of the following reasons\\""; it went on to list a handful of reasons, none of which even remotely applied to me. So either the evaluation is incorrect, or the reasons listed are.  I called HR Block support, which led me to a tech support person who was completely clueless as to what I was trying to tell her; instead she kept insisting that I must have entered bad data, because that must be the reason behind any problem: user error!  After trying to explain the situation several times, I finally told her that I am a software programmer with years of experience who knows a bug when she sees one, and all I was trying to do is to (1) report the bug and (2) hope to find out whether or not I really have an audit risk.  Ultimately the only help she could provide was to give me the telephone number of the local HR Block office, which was much more helpful;  However, either way, neither person was able to report this bug on my behalf, (and I could find no link on their web site) which leads me to wonder how any software error can get fixed.  And I have a relatively simple return!  Something else I learned, that was rather disturbing, at least according to that  tech support: HR Block has all the information I've entered into the desktop software already on their servers even though I haven't filed anything yet. I would love to know whether this is true. What if I chose to file by paper? in which case there is no reason for them to have my financial data."
1,"As many have noted here, this takes some time to install. I had my Garmin's battery go out, so I bought the aftermarket replacement kit http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Nuvi-750-Installation-010-00583-00/dp/B000UGPHI4/ref=cm_cr-mr-title. It worked fine, so now I had to decide whether to update the map also since it was a 2008. Finally bit the bullet, and am glad I did. My only criticism of it is that midway through the installation, it asks you to select the regions you want. It then appears to start the installation process all over again. If this is the case, why not ask at the beginning? Sure would have saved a lot of time. Otherwise, I had no problems installing it. So depending on how long you plan on keeping it, you should weigh buying a new map vs buying a whole new unit that comes with a map, a lifetime map in some cases."
0,"This year I am very unhappy with deluxe TurboTax.  In the past I have used this  deluxe program and it included state sales tax.  Reading the CD cover, it did not mention that it DID NOT include the state sales tax program.  The back could have easily included it where it checked what it did include.  Since I had used the Deluxe program many times, I assumed that it did.  Now I'll need to pay $20 to get the program.  No where on the information I've received from TurboTax and Costco does it say they will update the state sales tax.  Updating won't help me and many others who counted on the program to be like it was originally."
1,Great app thank you
1,Worked well. No problems.
1,There are a few differences between excel for mac and excel for PC however there is no need to dive into the technical details here as anyone with excel experience will quickly figure out what they are. Microsoft office is what it is - the only option for business work thus this is a must have for mac users.
1,This is the second year that I have purchased this program and it walked me through the process of filing my taxes step by step. I would recommend this to anyone that has a home & business and wants to fill out their tax forms themselves.
0,Seriously lacking in user guide
1,"Not a bad plays Blu-ray player, disc play without any problem and software updates regularly. As long as you know what you are buying everything is perfect.<br /><br />You have to remember, this is a very vanilla player and its main purpose is to play the disc contents period. It will not show any fancy designed main menu, but a very simple list like &#34;Play Movie, Chapter, Audio, subtitle, other titles.<br /><br />In Chapter and Other Titles only a list of time keys, no motion or still preview nothing.<br /><br />Over all personally I like it, because it serve its only purpose -to play the movies."
0,This year the Turbo tax was a joke . You had to upgrade and the cost was up. Bought the HR Block for a friend and Wish I had for me.
0,Don't know how to use it
1,"this is a great and well organized product. if you are looking for an all-in-one, stable, scanning and .pdf program, get this. worth much more than the price. i have been using it (version 8) for a year now."
1,i use quicken for my banking and paying bills and all that. this latest one is just going to keep me coming back. i like the upcoming bill layout.
1,Compared to the other Internet Security programs that I have used in the past Kaspersky seems to out perform all three of them.
0,"They require you to pay extra for everything. File Federal return? Extra. File State return? Extra.<br /><br />They claim to be part of the Free File Alliance, and that you get free filing -- you can't. The only way you can do it is online, through their website."
1,"Used Norton for years, and had to pay for multiple licenses, have to use McAfee at work and won't use it on my home computers (once crashed my laptop so badly they had to re-image it).  Daughter introduced me to Avast and haven't had any issues (or infections) in over five years."
0,"Misleading product description.<br /><br />The seller failed to convey the fact the product only renders a max resolution video of about 515 by 320 for small handheld devices, like black berry, ipods, iphones, other tiny portable devices.<br /><br />I want my money back. NOW."
0,"I would not purchase this product from Amazon or any other retailer.  The reward is simply not worth the risk.  The program does not work and customer service is virtually non-existent.  I had been a happy Quicken user for a few years before moving on to another product.  After a couple years, I decided to purchase Quicken 2012 when it was released on Amazon.  I don't feel that my accounts were that difficult to set up: a few checkings/savings, a couple retirement accounts, a simple brokerage account, a rental property and mortgage, and some student loans.  The setup was easy and the product worked well for two weeks.    However, on 10/18/11, I received my first error when attempting to download data from PNC bank.  After playing around with online support and user forums, I sent a request to customer service.  Over the past 2.5 months, I have sent the log files roughly a dozen times since they can't seem to keep track of them.  I have also chatted online with support as well as phone conversations.  Finally, two weeks ago, I got someone on the phone and after an hour, we were able to download the transactions.  The next day, the errors returned and service has been unable to help me since.  In total, as of 12/28/11, I have been unable to use quicken for ~10 out of the 12 weeks that I've owned the program, sent dozens of emails, and spent hours trying to solve the problem.  The only reason I have put this much effort is that Amazon does not refund money for downloadable software, and there is no viable competitor (since Mint is now owned by Intuit).  I do not recommend purchasing this product under any condition."
1,No issues. Downloading was a little slow but once it was on my laptop everything worked great.
0,"I agree wholeheartedly with everything that M in SC  wrote about Intuit's TurboTax 2014.  Intuit management should be ashamed.<br />Just be honest with people up front, increase the base price of your product, and don't use smoke & mirrors to try to make a few dollars more on &#34;Upgrades&#34; to your Product.<br />I wish Amazon management would contact Intuit management with respect to the myriad of complaints about this product."
0,"This is what happens when a company thinks it's got total control of the market.  They gouge the customer by both selectively chopping the features up so that the average user is forced into a &#34;premier&#34; edition and then they hit you with exorbitant pricing.  I've been a TurboTax user ever since they came out (I still have the last six CD's) and this year their arrogance pushed me over to HR Block!  TurboTax, you blew it!  Never again will I use your products - and I hope you die as a company.  You DO NOT control the market.  Yours is NOT the best product - not even close!  If you offered your top line product with personal consultation and gave it to me for free I'd tell you where to put it!  Your disdain and arrogance toward your faithful client base is a slap in the face, an insult.  Sorry Intuit/TurboTax, you lose!"
1,"Great product. Gets the job done right. There are guidelines for those with no experience, so with a little knowledge you will not be completely lost."
0,"Very Disappointing, filled with bugs.  Waisted hours!"
1,"Newer version available on-line, but this can get you started with Office-compatible suite for FREE.  (you can update to latest version if you allow it). I prefer LibreOffice to OpenOffice (they split from OpenOffice in 2011?, but both seem compatible).  I only dislike .pdf handling in v4.3, (fixed in 4.4.5)"
1,"The download, downloaded perfectly, which is what I hoped would happen.  Everything works as hoped for and works seamlessly. A trusted seller."
1,"I was thrilled to find this product downloadable as I recently deleted a mass storage component in my computer by accident.  The result was that my computer does not recognize and CD's, plug-n-plays, nada!  But I really needed to start this program for my business.  Amazon came thru with flying colors with a computer download immediately!  Dell even failed as they said it would take 7 days to ship??? but then provided a download link a day later to my email.  Way too late!  Amazon really came thru when I needed this.  Now I am walking thru the book for this program to really tweek my business to it.  It is very time consuming, but I know will be worth the effort when I can spit out P&L reports, vendor reports, etc on demand."
1,Terrific support and an easy to understand and use system for my business!  I recommend it to everyone I know!
0,"If I could give zero starts I would.  Just spent $116 for a product that I have now installed 4 times and never actually shows up as installed, so it's useless.  Microsoft should be ashamed of itself.  I am sure the issue is because I had a subscription to 365 but instead of renewing it, I bough this.  In order to get help from Microsoft they want you to pay for it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I am still not updating my rating for the following reasons, but I will update the posting.  After contacting Amazon, I was connect to a very helpful rep who walked me through installation.  The problem is the smart filter in Windows 8 and 8.1.  You have to disable it or it will block the installation.  You also need to disable all security software.  The installation process from the Microsoft website for Office 2013 doesn't give you ANY hint that either of these two things need to be done.  Also note - it installs in your Start Menu folder, which is anything but logical AND you may not be able to find it because the 'ProgramData' folder is hidden.  Here is the path you need to type in to find it.  C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br /><br />If you are the adventurous type, or just completely against the SaaS arrangement Microsoft is pushing for Office 365, feel free to purchase this download. I would say it was still worth my money...but maybe not the hour of sanity I had to give up."
1,Exactly what I needed
0,I hate that I am expected to upgrade to get the some of the same forms that were always included in years past. I've been using TurboTax for many years and will probably use something else next year.
1,"After reading a number of negative reviews, I was skeptical about upgrading to Quicken Home & Business 2013. But eventually I succumbed to upgrading. The import process went smoothly, no snags per se - just a minor annoyance with having to re-establish the secure connections with my accounts. Aside from this, I've had no complaints or issues with using the 2013 version. I'm glad I waited a bit in order to allow Intuit to resolve some of their early release bugs and issues, but it's been smooth sailing with Quicken. I only wish they provided a similar product for the Mac / OSX."
1,"I paid for this, and at FIRST, got nothing except a screwed up screen.    Then, I clicked the link for the update, and got another screen that finally had the code.  JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CLOSE ANY BROWSER WINDOWS BEFORE YOU FIND YOUR CODE, and make SURE your popup blocker is turned off. That seems to screw this up.    Really bad UI/UX - but, a great deal on something that Garmin themselves sell for $119.99."
1,"This software has worked very well for me, and I highly recommend it.  I appreciate Avast for offering it.  Thanks."
1,"This is my only editor. Ikick out some great videos. Everything is so easy to use. I only wish I was not hit with upgrade notices all the time.... but it rocks for editing speed, titles, cuts, audio tracks... all good!"
0,I had Quicken years ago and loved it.<br />I regret buying this. I'm planning to retire and needed t get  handle on spending. Too much work.<br />Ten  years ago much easier.  Oh well fifty dollars down the toilet.
1,"Avast has kept me out of malware trouble.<br /><br />But in asking for technical help on Google, I don't like getting &#34;help&#34; from sites ALLEGEDLY associated with Microsoft Windows, that are really run by scam artists pushing useless services at high prices. Each of these sites must be Googled and you must others ask if they are safe BEFORE opening."
1,"the VERY BEST free A/V program available!! I have used this product for many years and find it to be supremely effective, easy to use and therefore without parallel. I have also used other products, both paid and free, and have not seen the overall effectiveness and quality with them that I have experienced with this product. It's simply the best in my opinion."
0,"I would LOVE my Quicken 2013...IF it connected to my bank as it did previously.  For some reason it will not allow connection.  The error message keeps saying to register the product-I DID!<br />Up to this point, I loved my Quicken.<br />Now, NOT!"
1,I upgraded to this version 2015 after using version 2010 for four years. It was well worth it and I wish I had done it sooner. All those pesky little problems I had experienced before have all been solved. This is the best version yet of QuickBooks for the Mac.
0,"Unable to access one of my accounts. The error code generated causes the system to crash. Two hours on the phone with the help desk did not solve the problem. I requested a call back through the website, but I was never called back. At this point, I am unable to use the product and will need to un-install Quicken Premier 2014 and re-install 2013."
1,"Great software, I will keep using year after year.  I always make my own taxes because I want to make sure I don't miss out on any deductions I can take. This software will ask you a bunch of questions to determine that and the year after, you just have to update the info as it loads previous info on prior taxes.  So if you have the same donation center or child care expenses, it loads that up and you just change the amount."
0,I have tried many times and can't get to load so it works.  It just does NOT work.
0,this download version is terrible. product key does not work. wasted 4 hours. i would rather have the hard cd. have had norton last 5 years but had the hard cd.
1,"Awesome Software!<br /><br />I have been using H & R Block (formerly Tax Cut) for over 19 years and I highly recommend this program for those who are doing their taxes for the first time themselves or for those who are continued users.  This program is so user friendly and has just about every tax question and answer there is.  It is very accurate and lets you know when to update and how to update tax forms when they are available.  The price was very reasonable.... and what I like most is that you can e-file up to five federal taxes for FREE.  In the voice of Madea, \\""Hallelujer\\""!"
1,This product helps keep track of your finances.  It shows you were all your money is going to.  You have a clear view of how you hare spending your money.
1,"I like 2010 more than the last two iterations but it still takes some getting used to.  They've moved some buttons around so I find myself searching, but I can usually find what I need with a quick Google search."
1,I have been using Norton products as my anti-virus and firewall protection for my home PC's for a few years now.  I've been happy with the price/performance of this product.  The up to 5 devices was what I needed.
0,I wish I knew that banks would charge a fee to allow access to quicken prior to purchase. I did not see this in any review. M & T Bank charges $9.95 a month to allow my info to be transferred to Quicken. Found that many banks and credit companies now charge because of the fees associated for them from Quicken. Check with your bank prior to purchase to see if you have monthly charges. I purchased Quicken to help me save money not pay for more service fees.
0,Started Quicken in 2010.  Had trouble with many downloads from my bank.  They were put into the wrong categories and I had to waste time re-categorizing them.  Doesn't seem like it's improved very much.  Navigation is still confusing.  I use Quickbooks in the office and next year I will definitely switch over.
1,My 9 year old does this each day as part of her homeschooling...she's going to be typing much faster than she can write soon.  What a fun way to teach keyboarding skills.  Highly recommend.
0,"The spell check in Word does not work properly. All my settings are set for English,  just do spell check for a portion of the work.  It's frustrating!"
0,"Just crashed again!  Budget won't take new categories, trouble with just about everything.  Quicken needs to go back to the basic and figure it out!  Easier to track my finances through the bank and paper/pencil.  Don't buy!"
1,This product fulfilled a need that worked well for me and my client. The download was easy and the product was very good.
0,"Downloaded this program and gave it a shot, well everything seemed to be working good. I ran registry cleaner, then shut it down for the night. Next time I went to start up my computer, it would constantly reboot. In other words, something was messed up. The only way I was able to resolve this issue was to run a diskchk. This is where you computer checks for errors on the hard drive. From what I could see there were multiple registry errors. The only thing I can think of that would have caused this, was AVG internet security. I promptly uninstalled this program, and will probably never use it again."
0,"It did not work at all for me. My computer had other issues going on, I had to replace it."
0,"I'm unhappy with product because a program was installed and it didn't find the problem, and I had to find it my self."
0,"It is garbage!!! Tried 3 times in 3 computers, Does't work. why Amazon allow this garbage to cheat!"
1,I was looking for Microsoft Word without paying too much. This was an excellent substitute since I am a student.
1,I HAVE USED AVAST FOR OVER 3 YEARS WITHOUT 1 PROBLEM OR ISSUE YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED IF YOU CHOOSE TO UE THEIR FREE OR UPGRADED PROGRAMS
1,Simple and easy to use. Was able to convert our Disney collection to mp4 for mobile devices with ease. Great product at a great price!
1,Turbo Tax has been my preferred tax software since tax software became available.  I have never tried the others so I could be viewed as biased.
1,I had an older version - this new version is great!  So many new features and functions quicker!  Makes my work easier!
1,Good....as expected
1,"Easy to use, completed the process in a couple hours, refund in 2 weeks. State taxe forms not included in my software."
0,"I WILL NO RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE IT HAVE TO MANY CONTROL, THEN YOU ONLY CAN DO OR MAKE SOMETHING FOR HOME AND MAYBE NO STUDYING, BECAUSE COMPANY BLOCK ALL TO NO PRINT PAGES OF SOMETHING YOU MAKE FOR BUSINESS LIKE LETTER. ETC,THIS HAPPEN TO ME"
0,"Turbotax has progressively become worse over the past two to three years. I made this purchase thinking I would get at least one<br />State included for this price. My bad for not reading the fine print, Turbotaxes bad for loosing a customer forever. I purchased Taxact2014 with two States for the same price as this product with no States. Turbotax charges $40 per State and has priced them selves out of the market. Not to mention their security problems. I would recommend any product besides Turbotax, this is coming from a 10+ year user of Turbotax. Oh and as long as I  wasted my money on this years edition of Turbotax I did a side by side comparison with taxact. The products come up with the same results, and are very similar in the data entry department."
0,"As with many others who has written reviews about Intuit's crippling the Deluxe version to force us to pay more by having to upgrade to the Premier version, I wish to file my complaint.  I talked with Intuit's Customer Support and got the standard line from the Rep.  I worked in IT for 53 years prior to retiring, and I can assure folks that  their excuse they had to remove these schedules, when they have worked just fine for years, is pure bull ____.  Intuit offered me a reduced rate for the Premier version, and I accepted rather than having to go to HR Block or some other software.  If they don't reconsider their position I will certainly move on next year."
1,VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
0,"When I attempted to download the software, I received the following error message ...... The product you are trying to install is not an Adobe Genuine Software and appears to be counterfeit."
1,Works well every time.
1,"Turbo Tax is only tax software I will use.  It is not only trustworthy, but easy to use on an annoying task!!!"
1,Avast works seamlessly<br />does not interfere as much as other buyers protection programs that I have had in the past
1,This is a fun way to pass the time on the road with the little ones.  The content is very interesting and we learn something new everytime we play.  Good stuff.
1,"After two  years of using Turbo Tax I decided to buy this product for two reasons:<br /><br />* It was cheaper (H&R at home premium was almost one third the price of Turbo Tax Premier)<br />* I did not have my old PC that had Turbo Tax 2011 installed on it to pull up last year's return data<br /><br />The first thing I learned after purchase was that Turbo Tax does not necessarily require you having the same PC; it can import data even if you have the pdf of your last year's return. This is a plus for Turbo Tax as H&R at Home Premium only accepts .txf format. I did all I could to convert last year's pdf to .txf format but it was unsuccessful. So, if you are considering purchase of H&R at home you should probably have this in mind.<br /><br />The second thing was that when importing w-2 H&R at home only recognized one of the two employers I worked for in 2012. It said, we are not working with your other employer yet. So, I had to manually enter that one myself.<br /><br />It charges extra for state e-file just like Turbo Tax does(same amount). It claims the audit support is free while in Turbo Tax it required additional cost.<br /><br />So, given the price you may say it beats Turbo Tax, but it offers less services compared to Turbo Tax."
1,Worked Great!
1,I purchased the product which was priced almost 25% off of the already 80% off student deal. Right there that is a ton of savings.<br /><br />I had to verify that I was a student using a third party's system. The process was painless and I had CS6 operating within 10 minutes of buying the product.<br /><br />The serial seems to be legitimate and legal and I haven't found any problems yet.<br /><br />There were a lot of negative reviews on this product so your milage may vary. If you have a valid student ID you shouldn't have any problems. Verification from them was a 3 minute turnaround.<br /><br />Best of luck.
0,bad purchase<br />I couldn't see it was only for mac os lion<br />I lost the money<br />I lost the money
1,"This and photoshop elements is al I need to edit, organize my photos and speed up my workflow.<br /><br />I would recommend it"
1,"This version was so intuitive to use & included everything we needed to complete our taxes for the 2014 tax year. Will use it again next year. I was able to compare that past several years of returns prepared by professionals, so that helped me in the setup of depreciation tables."
1,"I like the sync with the cloud backu0p.  It workds effortlessly.  Otherwise, the 2014 version works the same way as the 2013 version."
1,"This is the third time that I have used Norton. One of my friends was using it and after hearing all the good stuff I was convinced.<br />On a slight negative point: The software does not tell the old that it has taken over and NOT to keep telling me that it needs to<br />be renewed. So, if you install the new 360 before the old is up, then you will keep being told its time to renew plus a time afterwards. It's no big thing, but they could correct it.<br />I plan on buying 360 for my brother for his birthday."
1,"Does what it says it will do. Can't complain about that. Let me think of what I can say bad about it.  mmmmm.....  Got nothing, sorry."
1,"It's much cheaper to buy a new download than it is to do the auto renew with Norton.  If you already have the Norton AntiVirus product running, when it expires you still click the Renew Now button.  Then it will ask you if you have a code or key.  At that point you enter your new product key code (which you can do with a copy/paste), and you will be up and running again.  I didn't realize this and uninstalled my old product (or thought I did) about 10 days ago and installed my new product, and then was surprised when it shut it down when my old product expired today.  But as explained, it was uncomplicated to move on to my new download purchase from Amazon.  As a court reporter, I needed a virus checker that is easy to shut down when using realtime with attorneys or the court, so this is the product I prefer."
0,"Switched from Turbo Tax after many years because it would no longer let me do a full Schedule C. Spent many hours getting used to a different interface, but was mostly happy with Block's product...until I got to the final review and was told that because I am self-employed, have marketplace insurance, and claiming self-employed health insurance deduction, I can't efile. &#34;You must fix this problem before filing.&#34; But it appears there's no fix other than to pay an H&R Block &#34;professional&#34; an exhorbitant fee to do the whole return over. No thanks Never again."
0,"This release is premature even for a product the developers acknowledge is unfinished and will be &#34;enhanced&#34; over the next many months with most-requested-by-users features.<br /><br />As a previous registered user of Quicken Essentials (QE), I was offered a $10 discount on Quicken for Mac 2015 (QM2015) and took them up on it.  Now I'm exercising my right to a 60-day money-back guarantee because this software is simply unusable.<br /><br />On my 2011 iMac with Mavericks 10.9.5 and 16 GB RAM, using QM2015 to open, create, or save a transaction takes about 20 seconds of spinning-ball wait time.  Yes there are some nice new visual features, and the migration from QE was painless (thankfully I saved a version of my QE database!), but performance is like using a 70s-era client-server system over a 300 baud dial-up just to access locally stored data!!  (For reference, I also use QuickBooks Online to manage a non-profit's finances and it responds almost instantly even though it really is a client-server system.)<br /><br />The fact that my nothing could be imported from my credit union, either directly because QM2015 can't handle the CU security access controls, or indirectly by exporting CU data to a file and attempting import it into QM2015, didn't help.<br /><br />Intuit should be ashamed of releasing this product.  Whether they are or not will say a lot about the company."
1,still learning how to use it but really like it so far.
1,"Been using it since 2005. Easy to understand & use, good value compared to using a tax prep service."
0,"Longtime user. Would give 5 stars to the 2002-2012 editions.<br /><br />Lots of little glitches in this year's edition. I had to install as Administrator to avoid a crash, some of the UI prompts were unintuitive (&#34;Buy State?&#34; I already bought it...) The big hang-up was that it wouldn't show me a Capital Gains worksheet so I ended up downloading the relevant worksheet from IRS and working it myself to confirm that Block's bottom line number was the right one. Also related to capital gains, some of the interview radio buttons when asking about gains (long v. short, covered v. noncovered) did not seem to update the underlying form correctly. Was able to get around that by filling out the form directly.<br /><br />It worked, it took a little longer. Seems like quality has fallen. Don't know if I'll buy it again."
0,Software was not compatible and would not download on two different laptops! Would not order any more Norton products from you again!
1,Been with Quicken for years so this was just an upgrade. Quicken product has always been an easy install and reliable product. Did a download version so it was even quicker to install since I did not have to wait for the disc to arrive via snail mail!
1,"This has to be the best bang for the buck of any Autodesk application and the Amazon pricing makes it an even sweeter deal. The user interface takes a bit of getting used to coming from an Adobe background, but there are tutorials on the web that can walk you through the learning curve. Currently I am importing scanned sketches, adding new layers and tracing using a Wacom tablet and stylus. Sketchbook is better for this than Photoshop or Illustrator because it is light and quick and does not rely on vector curves and lines. If you want editable vectors, use Illustrator."
1,"work well for me, will buy again if needed, help me with my taxes and filing my tax returns, must purchase the state separately."
0,"Kafka anyone?  when you down load you are supposed to receive an activation code s you can complete the filing and send it in.  so far, have not received.  also when I attempted to contact HR Block about it they changed the security question from what school I attended in the 6th grade to what street I lived on in the 6th grade.  Huh?"
1,"I've been using TurboTax for roughly five years now of the Home & Business edition.  There are almost always errors on my initial final check but nothing that isn't critical (for some reason it seems it is always personal vehicle for business use) and is quickly corrected - more than likely because I'm always jumping all over the place or didn't know what I was doing.  This is the perfect package for me: the wife and I file jointly, my wife works from home, I've got a day job plus I'm a small business owner as well as a rental unit - Home&Business is like a pretty bow that wraps up this box of yearly crap.  Don't get me wrong I'm as patriotic as the next tax payer is but sometimes I just get so damned mad about it - but I'm not mad about TurboTax.  TurboTax does the job I need it to do, especially when I wait to download it on 4/14.<br /><br />Also, I didn't know it but I was able to get 10% of my refund matched in a Amazon gift card - a neat surprise since I peruse Amazon quite frequently.  Anything to help that dollar stretch as further and far as it can go.<br /><br />I'll definitely be back for TurboTax next year."
1,"Have tried many different Antivirus programs, some paid, some free and I always come back to Avast!  Everyone should switch.  The paid version is very reasonable and awsome."
1,Avast Free Antivirus has performed perfectly for us over the past three years.  Before switching to Avast we paid for several different antivirus programs over the years.  Would highly recommend giving Avast a try.  You'll be well pleased with results.
1,I purchased this from their web site. It is easy to use and works great. The support is fabulous. I lost my serial number and sent an email to their support team. I received an answer with my serial number in less than thirty minutes. Thumbs up for the product and the customer service.
0,"I have used TurboTax for over 16 years. I purchased it this year at Costco and found the changes that TurboTax had made, and I was just as disgusted as the hundreds of other users who have reviewed this product, with the changes they had made. Changing the price is one thing, but forcing someone to upgrade after purchasing it in order for them to be able to do what they expected the product to do, is another. I saw, and still do see the companies attempt to win back their loyal customers, but to me that is little more than a bribe. That doesn't settle with me very well. To my way of thinking, they thought that they could treat us with contempt and simply get away with it. I admit that I wasted some money that I didn't need to. I did that by uninstalling TurboTax, and throwing it away. I then purchased H&R Block. I found no major difference in the way the two programs performed. I did come up with one problem with H&R Block. I bought it with the State filing because I had some income from a state that I do not reside in. It turned out that this software did not allow me to file in the State that I needed to, and I don't have any idea why. It worked out better though. This could be a coincidence because I really have no way of knowing. However, last year using TurboTax to file my state taxes, for the same income, in the same state, I paid 5 times as much in State taxes as I did this year doing that same State return by hand. It took me an hour and a half and a $.49 postage stamp. Maybe the State taxes did change that much from this year compared to last year but it seemed a little weird.<br />TurboTax, feel free to have one of your corporate people run a counter statement against my review. It may help stem your losses, but It will not change my mind because I no longer trust you, and you will not get my trust back again. Just because you try to make things right by offering a refund, or an upgrade, isn't enough to bring back trust that has been lost. At least not mine.e."
1,I have had several different versions - The latest is excellent!<br />I needed to capture a news video; Snagit did it very well both sound and picture!  This impressed me enough to write this review.<br /><br />I must say that its capabilities and complexity exceed my abilities in many areas.  They could continue to improve Snagit and make it easier to understand and use.  I have only been able to use the scroll capture on individual frames in a web page; maybe it can do the entire page but it eludes me after much effort.<br />Perhaps they need a simple/advanced switch for us novices...  All-in-All this is a great program.
1,"Photoshop Element does a good job for me and is somewhat simple to use.  However, I did prefer Element 10, but upgraded to Element 11 since it was able to open Nikon RAW files for my new Nikon D7100.  One problem I have encountered is if you open the RAW/NEF files and save them to your hard drive  via Nikon Transfer, you want be able to open them in Elements 11.  I purchased the paid version of Nikon Capture 2 and personally find Element 11 to be better, at least for me."
0,"I filled everything out and when I tried to submit I received a prompt saying I needed an update before I could file. I selected to update and it started to update then it closed the program, seemed to install the update and when the program starts again it again asks to update again and goes back through the same process over and over - NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE SOFTWARE - USED IT LAST YEAR WITH NOT PROBLEMS. CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM?"
0,Oh dear...I wish that I would have read the reviews before purchasing  Quicken Primier.  I've only had time to briefly look at it and already I see that my categories are alphabetized instead of by type....  Not good!  I'm going to look further and then decide what to do.  grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
0,"The reviews here on Amazon have thoroughly discussed the &#34;switcheroo&#34; that Intuit made of its Turbo Tax Deluxe product this year from prior years. Intuit responded after numerous complaints and corrected its marketing fiasco. Now here we go again. On the software box, it notes that a state e-filing fee is $19.99--but in a footnote to that pricing, in fine print, it notes that the price may increase. Well guess what? On March 20, 2015, in the middle of tax filing season, Intuit increased the state e-filing fee from $19.99 to $24.99 and the only way you know that is immediately before you hit &#34;click&#34; to file your tax return. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Our friends at Intuit continue to &#34;nickel and dime&#34; the customer. Apparently, this mid-tax season price increase is normal--it happened to me last year too, I just did not realize it! Intuit has such a good product but they are trying everything possible to make customers angry at them. The morale of the story is to file early--I just wish Intuit would disclose this business practice on its packaging. The product is 5 stars--the marketing and &#34;truth in pricing&#34; is one star--hence my 3 star review."
0,CRAP... Keeps locking up.. Microsoft support REALLY... WISH I could just get 2010 again!!
1,"excellent software, I get on well, fast and very intuitive. footage of my holiday with movavi editor are been worked out, and it does not cost much unlike other software costing much more. I advise you to use only movavi video editor"
1,I bought the downloaded version of the product key card - it was easy to use and had simple instructions. I was working in Excel in less than 2 minutes.
1,"You don't think a whole lot about the sound of your music until you've heard it like this!

No disappointments, it will spoil your ears."
1,I upgrade every year and really love this program.  This keeps our finances straight and I can track my personal and business accounts with just one program.

1,"If possible I would reward YourSafetynet with 10 stars, as I've only just installed the program and I don't yet know what we'll come up against. But so far I think it's fantastic, exactly what I was looking for! YourSafetynet is just the filter you need for protecting your children from all the malicious and risky websites that you can discover online. You are also able to  prevent computer addiction with this program. One advantage is that you can set up all of the filters exactly as you wish.    See the video instruction on YouTube:  [ ... ]    Some virus scanners provide basic web filter functionality. This functionality may conflict with YourSafetynet. Disable these potentially conflicting features of your virus scanner. This is also recommended by the YourSafetynet installer during installation."
1,"Great picture editing software without the the long, steep learning curve of Photoshop !! You be amazed at how great you can dial in your images with Lightroom. Plus it manages ALL your pictures, priceless !"
1,the program was great I only have 1 con and that would be that it could be made easier to move back and review your progress. That said it did work great
1,Thanks still working with this version
1,Its one of the best vpns it would be great if we were able to select remote locations of servers.
0,"Been a Deluxe user since the DOS days. Never again. Not even a schedule D?! Ridiculous!<br /><br />Despite the obvious money grab, the inconvenience this creates is unforgivable. This cynical ploy on their existing user base is the dumbest marketing move in recent memory. Screw them and their $25 rebate. Sasan Goodarzi should be marched form Intuit's premises."
0,"I have used H&R Block tax software for five years.  For 2014, I was very disappointed.  There is a serious glitch in this software involving the state tax amount.  The amount doubled in the transfer from Fed. form to State.<br /><br />Then the state (Michigan) portion had an even worse omission.  In Michigan, the first $20,000 of pension income is exempt from state tax.  This software did not automatically perform that function, nor it would not allow me to do it manually.  In addition, it would it allow me to manually correct the doubling error noted above.  I paid for the state tax software but had to do that by hand.<br /><br />H&R Block customer service line recommended I go to a field office as they could not help me.  The person at the office saw the problems I was having and recommended I DO THE TAXES BY HAND!!!<br /><br />H&R Block did a survey and asked me about my satisfaction with the product.  I let them know the issues three weeks ago and have not heard back from them yet."
1,I have been using TurboTax since 1986 (back in the DOS days) and it has been easier to use with each use new release.
0,I like that I can potentially use this on my tablet.<br /><br />I don't think it's as easy to use as my older version was.  I'm hoping that this will get easier with usage.  I think it's harder to do split transactions that might have debits AND credits within.
1,"Very good product, fast shipping and good price."
1,"A month ago, I decided I NEED to keep a main digital-journal, for my own sanity. Free psychotherapy: I need to focus. Plus I need to keep additional journals: \\""Arts & Crafts,\\"" \\""Our Cats,\\"" and \\""Genealogy.\\""<br /><br />I tried Evernote--turns out I absolutely loathe it. Evernote is as snidely and manipulative as Google. I really don't understand why Evernote is the \\""be-all and end-all\\"" for some people. My opinion of Evernote: YUCK!<br /><br />I tried iReminisce--it's merely okay: it doesn't have sophisticated features, and it hasn't been upgraded for over a year, meaning the developer has abandoned it. I tried Memoires by Coding Robots; Memories by Juicy Cocktail; Per Se by (Get)Sprouted; and Thoughts by green&slimy. I didn't like any of them--I'd rate these no higher than two stars (**). I didn't like the interface, or it didn't have enough (or array of) features, or the developer has abandoned it (no recent upgrades), or any combination of the above.<br /><br />I even tried out a scrapbook program called iScrapbook 4. If Scrapbook 4 had had decent word processing, there's a good chance I would have gone with them for journaling. Pretty nifty software, that Scrapbook 4. I will be getting Scrapbook 4 ANYWAY, just for the heck of it--it's so good.<br /><br />As I was saying, I returned the search for a journal program, this time with a \\""do or die\\"" attitude: THE WARRIOR IS GOING TO CONQUER FINDING A JOURNAL PROGRAM! This time, as I investigated MacJournal closely (the demo version from its website), I didn't pass it over this time--I liked what I saw, and the more I saw, the more I liked. While I respect other people's opinions giving software a low-rating, it's obvious that I don't see what they see, and they don't see what I see. I 100% disagree with their low-ratings. For its genre, MacJournal is as full-featured as Apple Pages or Adobe Photoshop, and pretty-darn high-quality. In fact, there isn't a lot to NOT to like about MacJournal. I like it--a LOT. I've used MacJournal for only two days, so time will tell. I've started journaling, and feel better already.<br /><br />Hence, I recommend MacJournal, giving it five stars (*****). Had this been ten years' ago, this calibre of software would've cost $200, so feel lucky you only have to pay $40."
0,"Downloaded and installed this from Amazon. Works fine and cheaper than the boxed version. The improvements over the previous version (2010?) are minor. The MAIN reason to upgrade is that Intuit discontinues support for downloading data directly from the Banks to FORCE you to upgrade. This stinks! I really wish they had some decent competition. Come on entrepreneurs, take these guys on,-its about time."
1,Easy to use and very effecient Some problems because we let last version expire but excellent customer assistance the 2nd time we called and got every thing taken care of quickly
1,Been very pleased so far with my McAfee. I switched from Norton 360 and found McAfee to be just as good.
1,This program serves all my needs. I have never had cause to regret installing it over 8 years ago. First Class
1,I just love the program .... Down load went okay. I am overwhelmed with the magic wand and how it helps to clean up unwanted things in your picture. Actually if I don't use anything else from this program I have gotten my moneys worth. Now if you can come up with the same easy application for fixing my blurred pictures I would totally be in heaven. THANK YOU
1,Easy to use. Very accurate.
1,"Used this for years now - but Intuit better put back into the Deluxe what they took out this year - not what is best for them, but what the customer expects."
0,"If NO stars were an option, that would be my choice.  I have been using Quicken for more than a decade and have come to rely on it for managing my finances, however, the last few releases have only brought problems.  I would have expected enhancements to the software to actually make it better and easier, but all I see is expensive updates that are buggy and problematic and no real feature enhancements.  I use the Premier version, and it is a joke.  They give you your credit score, which is nice, but I don't think the program does anything that the Deluxe version doesn't do.  I'm a very unhappy customer, and the program crashes unexpectedly while doing fundamentally basic things. I've lost hours of my personal time dealing with the many problems I have had using this product.<br /><br />Latest debacle:  They pushed out an update which I downloaded and tried to install.  It crashed and said I was not connected to the Internet, even though I was.  I was finally able to download and install the update, and when I went to open the program, it would not accept my password that I've been using for years.  What a shame.  Luckily, I'm now in the habit of backing up the data file every time I use Quicken so I can restore any time a have a crash or something like this happens.  Over the last 2 weeks, I've had to restore the data file from backup 3 times!!!  Who is testing your updates and program upgrades???  This is a joke.<br /><br />Intuit:  YOU SHOULD HANG YOUR HEADS IN SHAME.  YOU HAVE NEGLECTED THIS PROGRAM FOR YEARS AND FORCE EXPENSIVE UPGRADES FOR NO REASON.  YOUR PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS DON'T SEEM TO BE QUALITY CONTROL TESTED AND THE MESSAGE BOARDS OUT THERE ARE PROOF OF THE TROUBLE CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING WITH YOUR PRODUCT.  YOUR OWN WEB SITE HAS THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMER HORROR STORIES!  IF THERE WERE ANOTHER VIABLE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, I WOULD DROP YOU IMMEDIATELY."
1,Good program for bookkeeping.  Our office uses it everyday.  Easy to learn and even easier to use.  Give it a try.
1,What a quick and easy way to get tax software and begin your taxes in just a few minutes. Very easy to use.

0,A few things are very simple and intuitive.  Any additional functionality or trying to harness the [supposed] power of quick-books is difficult to figure out.

There are many start ups in the space - research and get a cloud only version.

AND... on top of all of that uselessness, when I did manage to hack my way through editing a document, when I printed it off the quality was so poor that I could NEVER use it with customers.

Now that I can write checks, I'll use it, but I'll continue to look for a better product.

0,"I find this program full of unrealized potential. If I try to sync it with Google Calendars, it either deletes events from Google or Anytime, or it pastes multiple copies of the same event. If I try to print my schedule, it offers several possible layouts, none of which is helpful, and only covers half the day. If you try to protect your password database with a security question, it asks it every time you open the program, and then again if you want to go to the password database.  I suppose all of these are minor problems, and could be resolved or tolerated. However, the point that makes this a one-star purchase is this: today the program (not my computer) crashed, and deleted all the changes I had made today. Hours of planning, scheduling, and adjusting simply vanished, and I have no way of recovering it. Now, I'd be the first to blame myself if it were simply a matter of forgetting to save before I closed it, or some such problem. But for it to be running smoothly all day, crash, and delete all my work--that is unacceptable from such a vital program. Why does it not have an Auto-Save, or an Auto-recover?  Maybe this program could be good--at least it has the right idea. But there are too many problems with the program, and I can't have this unreliability from something I depend on to keep me organized."
0,"I have used this product for many years.  I have my own business.  I buy my own health insurance.  This year (2014 tax year) the software just quit saying it could not continue because I bought my health insurance on the marketplace and that I should go to an H&R Block office to work with a &#34;professional.&#34;  I found no way to continue.<br /><br />I USED to like and use this software.<br /><br />Now I am a turbotax user.  By the way, it was very easy to switch."
0,"As others have said, this new subscription model seems to be a cynical cash grab and to force users into paying yearly 'or else' - else being immediately losing access to all your documents the moment the subscription expires.<br /><br />No longer do microsoft want home users to be able to buy their software once at a reasonable price and use it for as long as they like without paying additional for the privilege. This is anti-consumer and should be condemned as such.<br /><br />Stick with the older Offices if you can or try one of the free or much cheaper alternatives suggested by R. Jacobson \\""felsen428\\"": LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice, Calligra Suite, OxygenOffice Professional, SoftMaker Office or Feng Office Community Edition."
1,I really enjoy the simplicity of the system.  It is connected to my bank and makes reconciling accounts very easy.  I have reports at my fingertips which makes filing taxes a breeze or applying for credit really easy because the data is easily available.
0,they charge way too much to State E-file<br />just be careful of not letting them trap you into paying 30 bucks for something you can mail for 1 dollar
1,"Have used Tax Cut for years, it is great!!"
1,"Great product just use https://www.moviestudiozen.com/ for great tutorials.  I work in the IT Field and used this to edit and render tutorials on how to use our products.  Seems to me the PC equivalent of iLife suite for PC.  Without having to pay the pricier cost of owning a mac.  I am not anti-Mac I work on both platforms, just cite cost for my opinion."
0,"Could not import trades or other taxable 1099s from Etrade or Ameritrade to Schedule D, even though HRB software lists both brokerages as being importable.  Fidelity trades imported without a problem.  No luck with HRB customer service.  Brokerages both said that it was a software glitch, HRB told me I should manually enter the trades if I can't import.  Total trades are well under 150.  Update:  Can import TD Ameritrade now.  Use info on 1099, not login and password, to import.  Etrade estimate I saw was Feb 24"
1,"Norton Antivirus is the BEST antivirus program sold!  I've used Norton's products for years and have ALWAYS been satisfied with not only the product, but Norton (Symantec's...) services.  This particular product includes not only an antivirus program, but a firewall, utility and backup programs also.  I highly recommend this product to any PC, Apple, tablet or phone product!"
0,Didn't even get to the software because I spent 30 min downloading it from Amazon to find I need a second disc.  Then Amazon tells me its my security settings however I download and install thins all the time.  What a bunch of crap!
0,"I should have paid attention when other reviewers said this didn't work on Windows 7.  I have a brand new laptop, that the kids use for homework and stuff.  I even had a Staples computer technician try to install it for me.  He couldn't get it to work either.  Save your money.  Amazon won't refund digital downloads."
1,"this is the best free antivirus I have used, It does not slow down your computer. have installed it on all my computers."
1,"This was the smoothest TurboTax had ever worked for me. In past years, updates always seemed to cause some glitches. This year, I had no problems whatsoever on installation or updates. Still offers excellent in-application help as well as on-line support. The only thing better would be if it did my taxes without my input LOL!"
0,"I am so disappointed in Intuit after years of being a loyal customer.  I had heard that their on-line version of TurboTax was a horror last year with price gouging for every schedule.<br /><br />This year their decision to remove Schedule D of the Deluxe version is unacceptable.  I intend to return the software and purchase H&R block to meet my needs.  I also intend to contact Vanguard and my bank who recommends &#34;Free&#34; Turbotax and voice my displeasure with Intuit.<br /><br />And don't think Intuit hasn't offended the tax professionals as well.  For Lacerte and Proseries, they have required a fast path program which is billed separately, does nothing and is just further proof that the company has no regard for their customers.  This large, increased cost has to be passed on to a tax accountant's customer so you are losing on all fronts."
1,"I was a practicing CPA for 26 years. But I've been using Turbotax for years. It's a great, failproof product. If you are uneasy with taxes, just follow the easy guide so you don't miss anything. Why pay a service $100s when you can do it yourself?"
1,easy step by step guides; click on amazon/download/easy to install; has all the basic microsoft office features; totally recommend it!
1,Very Good
1,"PC Matic, subscribe, download, lean back and watch it go get the bad guys who try to capture or violate your electronics...  A deal at twice the price...  Happy surfing without concern of damage to your PC...<br /><br />TH"
0,"Absolutely terrible. I've been a turbo tax customer for the past ten years and this is the first time I've been unhappy. The program calculates wrong, doesn't let you fix things in the forms. We had to file for an extension to hire a tax advisor to do them this year."
1,Gotta have it! :-(
1,Best offer you can buy!
1,"I've been a recent user of Quicken 2009 and declined an upgrade to 2010 because there wasn't much new in it, and the reviews on that product were not so good, so why spend the money?    I looked at 2011, it seemed to have at least several new features, and the early reviews, in many cases from beta testers, seemed decent; I'd have to update eventually to keep the online updates working [that's a whine, but I won't get into that], so took advantage of Amazon's reasonable price.    Upgrading from 2009 went seamlessly. I like the new file structure (introduced in Q2010) where instead of a flock of different files, there is only one large database file.  This may not matter a lot for the occasional user, but if you get involved with shuffling files around on your computer, or deal with backups, its a lot more convenient and way less prone to error.    The interface is a bit cleaner, but it takes some getting used to where to find things.  Hard to say if all the changes are for the good or not, it's a personal preference.    Quicken says the one-step update should be faster, because the downloads are now done in parallel; I'm not so sure about that, it still seems to sometimes take a while, but this hasn't been a big deal.  There seems to be one anomaly after conversion, some of my accounts downloaded a duplicate transaction that was already in my register, so I had to carefully check that out and delete them, but this seems to have been a one-time issue after the update.    Another problem is with PayPal accounts, credits are being entered as debits, but after debugging this issue, I believe the fault is with PayPal, hopefully they'll pay attention to reports on this.    One interesting item that I'd bet not a lot of people pay attention to, is that the product license allows for the installation on 3 computers in the household, so it is perfectly legal to use that one copy for multiple family members/computers.  Just for some peace of mind there.    I haven't really experienced any problems (on 2 different installations) that others may have reported -- no crashes, corruption, or major issues so far.  Of course there's always SOMETHING you're not going to like, SOMETHING you want added or handled differently, that's natural.    I do find the 'all transactions' pseudo-register rather useful when searching for transactions.  Quicken has added more categories to the default list, and the program does seem to do a more thorough job of categorizing things and matching up transfers and scheduled transactions, although again sometimes changing the way things work can backfire for some people.  One can hardly expect EVERY transaction to automatically be perfect, there's not always enough info from the institution to determine that, sometimes there are difficulties especially with brokerage accounts.      The new 'spending' tab is nice, although I haven't found a reasonable way to have it consider things like dividends in my investment accounts to be counted as 'income'.      I'm somewhat encouraged that Quicken, even though they've got a virtual monopoly in this space, seems to have put forth some effort in producing a reasonable facelift.      I hesitate to give it more than 4 stars, more based on the idea that you get NO discount for being a previous user (you do get a discount offer on Quicken's site, but Amazon's price was better anyway), and it's disturbing that online update features are 'sunsetted'.  I'd almost be willing [depending on price] to accept a subscription model where you'd pay an annual fee but be entitled to the latest version as it rolls along."
1,I was very happy with the speed of download and time it took to get going. All took less than 15 mins.  I had an expired version on my computer and it took it over.  All my preferences were transferred to new version during download so that I didn't have to re-set anything. It picks up any problems and lets me know. Warns me about websites that are not properly certified and keeps me happy knowing that I am protected. Also with Amazon I got it for a reasonable price. Thanks Amazon ;)
1,Very well put together. Step by step and as in-depth as you want it.
1,I desperately needed this software upgrade to prepare a Powerpoint presentation while at a class away from home.  I was able to purchase the Office software and install it via wifi in my hotel room.  It met my needs and solved my problem is relatively short time.
1,I like it
0,"First let me say that I have used both Turbo Tax and QuickBooks for years. The main reason that I use Turbo Tax is because it is SUPPOSED to import the data from QuickBooks and has done so in the past. For some reason, it would not import my data this year. I figured that should be an easy fix for Tech Support. Was I ever wrong!<br /><br />Once I finally found a phone number that I could call I was eventually connected with a very pleasant young lady. She was very nice and pleasant but seemed to know very little about the product. She &#34;checked&#34; and said that others had been having the same issue. At this point she contacted her 2nd level support. Now things got painfully slow with her acting as a relay between me and this other level of support. She would ask me to do something, it wouldn't work, she would type back to her support person, 5 or 10 minutes later she would come back and have me try something else that didn't work. We did this for about an hour, trying the same couple of thing over and over getting the same error every time. All this time I was not allow to speak with anyone who knew what they were doing, just this person acting as a go-between.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I had to enter all the information in by hand that TurboTax was supposed to pull from their own product, QuickBooks. I will NEVER be using TurboTax again! If I have to enter everything in myself, I might as well just use a better product like H&R Block tax software."
0,Always make sure I have one!
0,"The interface is OK but there aren't many helps along the way. Even though I purchased the Deluxe + State, it still costs an extra $20 to e-file a state return. This isn't obvious on Amazon's site."
1,Will keep using H&R block software for the a long time!
1,"Despite all of the negative reviews, I'm setting up my finances outside of Excel for for the first time. Comparing other software like iBank and Moneydance, I found Quicken to be very reasonably priced (purchased on sale, similar in price to the Amazon price at the time of this review), and included features that iBank wanted to charge a monthly subscription for (downloads from Financial Institutions, mainly).<br /><br />I don't have any stocks or money market accounts to track. I just want to track where my money goes, know when bills need to be paid, pay off some debt, and project my future cash flows. Quicken does brilliantly compared to the competition. If I had purchased at full price, I don't know if I'd feel the same way. The software does what it's supposed to do, if you consider it independent of its Windows counterpart (which also comes in many different editions).<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm pleased with it, and would recommend it for &#34;average Joes&#34; like myself, not for those with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in advanced investments."
1,Excellent.. I had been using another software for years and this one is even easier with great notes. EASY to use and simple to learn (did take me a while to figure out using a Parenthetical - I'll save you the 15 minutes... it's Ctrl +4). Super cheap!!!
1,A great product for free - what a great idea.  . What more would you want from a product?  Automatic updates? included.
0,"Don't buy this. Very limited and big time waster. Never got it to transfer and I tried Ethernet, Wifi, and USB."
0,"It's not super difficult or really incredibly challenging, but it is fun to learn the language and the visuals are pleasing.  It's not Rosetta Stone, but I didn't pay a hundred dollars for it either."
0,"But I just wanted to add one point for people that primarily do work in web design and interface design. There are many great solutions out there that best Photoshop in almost every area. Bohemian Coding's new app Sketch is one serious competitor to Photoshop these days. One of the apps main advantages is that it focuses entirely on web and interface design so you don't have to drudge through all of Photoshops bloat to be able to find the features that you are looking for. This is the way that it always should have worked but Adobe axed several applications that have worked this way (this last year they killed the once great Fireworks and a number of years earlier they discontinued ImageReady.)<br /><br />Tools are incredibly easy to find in Sketch, no digging through endlessly long menus with endlessly long submenus. The features that you see in Sketch for $80 are roughly the same ones you will see in Photoshop with many features debuting in Sketch first. This is one of those rare products that is both vastly better and vastly cheaper then the competition. I encourage you to search feature comparisons between Photoshop and Sketch. You might find that you will be perfectly happy with an older subscription free version of Photoshop (such as CS6) and then just let Sketch handle all the new web design features. A major upgrade to Sketch has been teased as of 3/22/14 so expect Sketch's few short comings to get ironed out very quickly.<br /><br />UPDATE 8-25-15 This is about the third or forth time I have updated this review but ever since I wrote the original review more great competition keeps poring in. One of the most promising new products competing with PS/Camera Raw this year that just came out is Affinity Photo. Here is a copy of my review from the Mac App Store:<br /><br />Nice start to a new suite of graphics apps<br /><br />I am a big fan of Serif’s drawing app Affinity Designer so I was very excited to see this new app in the suite that is even more tightly integrated then the Adobe programs. From the time I have spent playing with it there are a number of things I actually like more then Photoshop:<br /><br />Raw photography is placed inside the app rather then just from a plugin. This allows you to easily switch back and forth between raw editing tools and your basic photo editing tools.<br />There is a separate persona for editing web graphics which is very nice. Photoshop now buries all the web tools in difficult to find places since they no longer have a web graphics tools anymore (Fireworks and before that ImageReady.) I found the separate app approach was easier and I am glad to see Affinity adopt a similar (and better!) approach by putting all web tools in a separate persona. I now have the advantage of having like tools grouped together without even having to leave the app like I did with Fireworks!<br />The masking tools work differently then in Photoshop and allow for some interesting possibilities in how to hide certain parts of an image. It took me a little while to figure out how masking worked but in some ways I would say it works better.<br />Affinity programs now share the same file so the days of making complex file structures in the Finder may be over! One file for illustration, photo manipulation, and eventually page layout (next year for the page layout.) This should be very helpful once Affinity moves to iPad that has a simpler file structure.<br /><br />The main short comings of the product to me is that it doesn’t have a way to easily batch edit photos or do cataloging. The way that I do most of my photography these days is do a photo shoot of similarly shot photos, edit one of the photos and then apply those changes to all the others. This is a huge time saver over editing one photo at a time. Until Affinity Photo has those features I don’t see using it as my main editing program. The developers have talked about looking at adding some of those features so I hope that happens soon.<br /><br />Overall great version one software. Adobe will probably become the Quark XPress of graphics software. What I mean by that is Quark was once dominate but better options came along and eventually overthrew them. Remember InDesign use to have far fewer users then Quark at one point. I personally believe the Affinity Suite can go after Adobe even quicker then the time it took InDesign to become dominate Quark. ID 1.0 was very immature but Affinity 1.3 is quite good from the start.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014: I have been using the new version 3 of Sketch for several weeks now and it is awesome! Version 2 was already very good and they still managed to make version 3 way better. Now includes support for symbols and a very easy and powerful way to export images.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who marked my review as helpful and even to those few Adobe employees who marked it as unhelpful!! I am glad you are reading these reviews so you can learn more about how your competition is going to thoroughly wipe you out in the next few years! Cheers!<br /><br />PS It has been helpful to me to hear the reviewers on this page talk about competition to Photoshop I was not aware of. Sketch focuses on webdesign like I said but I would be interested in replacing Photoshop in other areas besides web design as well.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/24/14: I just recently came across another really good replacement for Adobe software that in many cases blows the Adobe option out of the water. I spent almost all of today working with Serif's Affinity Designer and it is a really incredible alternative to Illustrator. Since a lot of designers use Photoshop and Illustrator closely together to draw I thought it would be appropriate to mention it here on the Photoshop page.<br /><br />I was one of those people who was very frustrated when Adobe killed Freehand to replaced it with Illustrator which I always loathed. I am so glad to see that Affinity Designer seems to have the user friendliness of Freehand and yet also has powerful features that surpass many of Adobe's features. I will just briefly mention a few of my favorites.<br /><br />- Affinity has lots of live actions you can view by scrolling through a list. This one is a big time saver. If you ever wanted to see what a blending mode looked like on an object without having to click each blend mode one at a time down a list of 26 blend modes you can do that in Affinity Designer. You simply move your mouse over each blending mode and the object changes as you go down the list. This functionality works across many areas of the app. You also can use it as a quick way to scrub through the history panel as well.<br /><br />- The eyedropper tool works across different programs to pick up a color you want to include in your design. This is really helpful as half the time I want to select a color outside of the drawing program.<br /><br />- The company has worked on a rotation canvas feature that allows for better arm angles when you draw on a tablet. Photoshop users will be familiar with this feature but Adobe never moved it over to their drawing app where it really belongs. One of the developers showed it off on their forum page and it seemed to work just as well as it does in Photoshop. The feature will be available in a later version.<br /><br />- Serif is planning on releasing a whole Affinity suite that will also have competitors to InDesign and Photoshop. Interestingly enough the software suite should rely on a single file format that will be used across their whole line of apps. At this time only the illustration program has been released but the other apps will be coming out very soon. A Photoshop competitor should be out in a couple months or so. What I really like about this company is when I use their product I keep thinking &#34;this was what I kept waiting for Adobe to do years ago but they never did&#34;.<br /><br />Occasionally I hear people talk about how Adobe has become mature and all the major featuresto their programs have already been added. I think it should be clear that software like Sketch, Affinity Designer, and Pixelmator are proving that wrong.<br /><br />Also I expect there to be a lot more competition to Lightroom in the future. Lightroom is still a very immature program and has a lot of opportunity for competitors to take advantage of it's weaknesses. Capture One Pro just came out with a new update and it looks like good competition to Lightroom. The touch version of Pixelmator just came out and I can't find a review that doesn't say that it is substantially better / more feature rich then the touch version of PS. Expect a flood of Adobe competitors to keep surpassing their products. There is not much reason to join Adobe's subscription service and keep paying for their mediocre updates.<br /><br />UPDATE 2016:<br /><br />Affinity Designer is now on Mac and Windows. Affinity Photo is on Mac and available as a beta on Windows. Spread the word so that people know this program is now available on both platforms.s lots of live actions you can view by scrolling through a list. This one is a big time saver.

1,a great program and is FREE!!
0,"Purchased last month.  Everything that I used to use still works, but the program seems much slower than 2010 (which I was previously running).<br />May start looking for alternatives although I have been a Quicken user for 15 years since the program just seems too bloated now."
0,I just read the story in USA Today.  I'll be returning my CD tomorrow and buying a competitor's product.  I have been using TurboTax since the mid-90s.  Adios to their deception.

0,This product is good against viruses bit can be cumbersome in the background. It takes too much control over your computer.
1,This product meets my expectations. Only problem I have is that I can find a &#34;Spell Check&#34; or &#34;Gramma Review&#34; button on Microsoft Word. I have to right-click on every word and click spell check to view my options.
1,I have been using Quicken for years.  I got a new laptop and wanted the newest version.  Works great.
1,This is my sixth year using H&R Block's TaxCut software to prepare our tax returns.  I hadd the Deluxe version which I strongly recommend if you also prepare your state taxes electronically.  I have found thata the AuditChecker feature as well as the auto-populate feature (from past returns using TaxCut) provides a relaxing state of mind.  The program can also quickly check on available updates to the tax code easily while you are preparing your returns.  I also use the backup feature to electronically store my returns.  I really have enjoyed this product and will continue to use in the future.  My downloading of the software from Amazon.com did not create any issues.  The download process was quick and well-explained.
1,"No problems, seems to work flawlessly.  Will have to wait and see if it catches all viruses.  I,d recommend it."
0,"I got a copy along with a new PC I bought. The software required a Mcafee account to use. The button to do it literally could not be clicked. Everything else was clickable, but not the one that would allow the software to be activated past about a week. I've never seen that happen before.<br /><br />I was eventually able to get it working by reinstalling, but it wasted bandwidth and time.  Afterwards, the software detected what it said was a virus, but I couldn't find any information regarding what it was.  I hope it wasn't anything real.  Most of the antivirus programs lie and call cookies detections so they can justify their existence, because your average user often doesn't realize that finding nothing may be a very good thing indeed.  It's like insurance.  You pay for it and hope you never have to use it."
1,"It's a great software: easy to use, capable to do a lot of things. Newer version has short cut keys. Awesome!!!"
1,I have completed the first of 5 courses.  I love the method learning system.  I fully expect to be fluent within the year.
0,"I downloaded Turbo Tax Premier 2014 version for my Mac and discovered it no longer supports OS X 10.6.8.  I do not want to upgrade my Mac at this time to OS X 10.7 or higher,  so this version is useless to me.  Intuit should not have stopped supporting 10.6.8, but since they made this unexpected change, it should have been announced it up front (at the point where you select &#34;Mac Download&#34;) instead of allowing this information to be buried in the system requirements which are displayed at the very end of Amazon's lengthy description of the product.  After years of using Turbo Tax Premier, I am switching to H&R Block Deluxe which does support OS X 10.6.8.  To their credit, Intuit did mail me a refund after I contacted them."
1,This is a great software package that can be used by a person with limited knowledge of editing photos but also has the tools to satisfy a more knowledgeable person. You can't beat it's simplicity of use and the final results. The cost is very reasonable for this product.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to all levels of users.
0,"Device #1: Windows 10 desktop, typical install, no problems.<br />Devices #2 and #3: Android phones, fast install, software is a resource pig at 27% of memory usage on average<br />Device #4: Notebook. Over 6 hours of hassle trying to get the software to finish loading without seeing the 'Not responding' dialog. Five of those hours spent with Norton techs. All three said in this order: It's a Windows 10 problem, it's a hardware problem.<br />Both device #1 and #4 ran PERFECTLY WITHOUT A PROBLEM  on Norton 360 versions 2013 and 2014.<br />My conclusion: Norton, i.e. Symantec is using Windows 10 as an excuse for inadequacies in their program.<br />Looking for another 'security' suite for the first time in many many years. Adios Norton."

0,"I know it sounds pretty repetitive, but I to have also use Turbo Tax Basic for 20+ years. But I refuse to pay $90 just to have access to Schedule D to report a couple dozen stock trades. From what I can tell H&R Block Basic has everything Turbo Tax Premium has at a fraction of the cost."
0,"Last year, after spending several hours I managed to get a proper return done for my 2-person LLC.  This year Quickbooks and Turbotax simply don't speak the same language.<br /><br />Throughout the year, I make regular distributions to my partner and to myself.  I have tried booking those alternatively to our equity accounts or directly to retained earnings but nothing works.  Whatever I do, when I am ready to import the Quickbooks file into Turbotax the result is nonsensical.  Additionally the program does a horrible job of explaining the implications of the questions that it asks during the interview process.  For example, if you make special allocations to one or more partners it is nearly impossible to reflect that properly on the tax return and on the K-1s.  It is absolutely stunning that two programs which have been around for so long and which are sold by the same company could inter-operate so poorly.<br /><br />The program flags discrepancies which are not really there.  For example some entertainment expenses are only 50% deductible.  Not surprisingly, once the adjustment to the book income is made, there is a difference between book income and tax income.  However, I have found no way to simply accept that difference and move on.  If the difference can be explained by the different treatment of expenses for tax and book purposes, why do I have to tear my hair out trying to trick the program into accepting the differences?<br /><br />I specifically waited until late January to download the program, figuring that will give Intuit time to fix any issues.  As things stand now, I think I will simply download the forms from the IRS and fill them out by hand.  Unbelievable."
1,"If you're looking for an accountable and user friendly software, QuickBooks is the way to go.  After using many different types of software over the years, this one makes me smile which is VERY important when working with numbers all day.

0,I watched video and the CEO said that we will be able to upgrade to turbotax premier for free. But when I tried to upgrade it still asks me to pay $30. I hesitated for a while before purchasing it. Looks like that I made wrong decision.
1,I usually buy H&R Block tax software in retail stores. This time decided to buy the software by download from Amazon. It was very convenient.  Great service and reasonable price. I have been using the software for many years since Microsoft version.
1,I hope that this works and helps me to keep my computer clean.  My computer could not get onto the internet.  I am lost without the internet.
0,"This was my first time using Turbo Tax and I was reluctant to use it when reading the reviews but after hearing a friend praise the software, I decided to give it a try.  I downloaded the software after purchasing it on Amazon and immediately began the process.  Let me first say that it is immensley user friendly. It honestly guides the user through the questions and I think it's great for anyone who becomes overwhelmed with filing their taxes.  I also enjoyed the ticker at the top that estimates your refund/payment and changes as you enter new information.  At the end of the process when I was about to efile my return, I was given a bill for $54.98 with the charges of:<br />Turbo Tax Virginia State E-file Fee $19.99<br />Refund Processing Service Fee $34.99<br />I just want to ask what was the $39 that I originally paid for? I get it that everyone looks for opportunities to upsell but I really feel taken advantage of.  I purchased a product that states efile is included... if it's included there shouldn't have been a refund processing service fee. Please be more forthcoming with the price.<br /><br />Update: I called to ask what the $34.99 charge listed as Refund Processing Fee was for and was told that I choose to pay the $19.99 Virginia State E-File Fee from my refund versus paying it with a credit card and that is the reason for the charge.  I said that I understand but I didn't see an explanation for this when I made the decision; if I would have known that paying with a credit card would have been free of extra charges versus an extra charge for paying from the return, I would have gladly paid with a credit card. He said that was a common problem that people had. I'm not sure if the problem is due to my ignorance but I really think that they made everything so well explained throughout the process of filing, I am sure they could have done a better job of explaining this. I learned my lesson I hope others avoid this mistake and hope that Turbo Tax makes it better understood on their next version.ir next version."
1,"Easy to use and gets the job done, but they charge 19.99 to file state taxes"
1,"I was a turbo tax user, but after seeing the reviews for the 2014 version i decided to move to the H&R Block solution. Nice! Easy to use."
1,Great
1,I've used TaxCut products for 15 years & am very comfortable with it. It all depends on what you get used to.

0,"Never again will I use Turbo tax !!!  I have a very simple situation, and have used TT Basic for years.  But now, when I am process of finishing my return in TT Basic,  I get a notice that I have to upgrade to finish my return (for $40).  It's time to go to TaxAct or HRBlock.  Update 3/21/15:   After calling TurboTax, they did agree to upgrade my product to the Deluxe version.  That allowed me to file my federal return.  The Deluxe version also does state taxes, and although my state return (Pennsylvania) is simple to do online directly with the PA Dept of Revenue, I thought that I would try TurboTax.   What a disaster !  Pennsylvania taxes are very simple: there are no itemized deductions, and most retirement income (from pensions, IRAs, etc) is not taxable.  But you do have to report the 1099Rs, and establish a retirement &#34;type code&#34; to determine that it is non-taxable.  TT gets it wrong here.  It doesn't even ask the right questions to establish the proper type codes.  After much frustration, I had to go to &#34;forms&#34; mode to get the codes right.  Also, there is a clear software bug in the Pennsylvania state version: it can get into a mode where it just keeps asking the same series of questions over and over without end.  Clearly an &#34;amateur level&#34; product.   I ended up abandoning the PA State version of TurboTax, and doing my taxes the old way !"
1,"With QuickBooks 2014, Intuit has finally brought the Mac version of their software up to par with the Windows version. After suffering for two years with AccountEdge's cumbersome and confusing system, I can finally switch back to QuickBooks and spend less time trying to learn new software and more time getting work done."
1,Can't go wrong with norton
0,This year TurboTax is not good. It's missing things that you need and files just disappeared for no reason. My take file is completely gone today on 4/14/15. I didn't print it out or e-file because I have to pay tax and wanted to send it off tomorrow and could not find my take return on Turbotax. What a waste of money. Definitely will never use Turbotax again.
1,I have been a faithful turbo tax users for over 15 years and each product is an improvement on the previous years versions. it is simple to walk through and follow the prompts.  And the error checking alerts you of any omissions or potential audit flags.
0,Not user friendly to new Quicken users; can't find a downloadable tutorial; it's NOT intuitive; system keeps locking up. Shocking since I thought this was supposed to be easy.
1,Covers all the important area's of threat. Keeps the hard drive clean and operating at max performance. Best price I could find without the pain in the rear  MAIL IN REBATE  B--L .S***!
0,the UI looks good but the engine is incomplete...
0,I paid for this software and I was charged 130.42 which was more than the price on the website. I guess Amazon or Microsoft decided they wanted a few extra dollars from me right as I ordered it. Wow... Not Cool!
1,"This version looks and acts very much like the last one - although I'm sure there's enough \\""under-the-hood\\"" updates to make it a necessary update.  Doesn't seem any better/worse than previous versions, though.  It works. It keeps my books.  Online banking connections are functional.  What else can you ask for from accounting software?  Another year - another version - another $79 upgrade...."

0,"We have been using QuickBooks since 1990 and have always been very satisfied with the product. I'm now finding that there are some glitches that no one is able to resolve.  The online help has also not been helpful as there are other clients with the same issues.  Two examples:<br />- Bills that have already been paid continue to show up in the &#34;Pay Bills&#34; screen.  This can be very costly if one is relying on the accuracy of this function.<br />- GST continues to update itself when entering invoices even though the correct amount has been entered.  Now we must go back to the invoice once it's been saved and re-enter.  Very time consuming.<br />Over all I still believe the product is very good, I just wish the &#34;Help&#34; would be more helpful."
1,"Once upon a time ago I went looking for a way to organize and keep all my recipes in one place instead of slips of paper that come up missing.  I researched the internet and found Cook'n.  I feel it is one of the best recipe software programs on the market.<br />I recently upgraded to the Version 10.  I ran into some difficulty and they proved their customer service is outstanding.  Their response to my email and the remote repair of my situation to save what I thought was lost was exceptional.<br />The program is so user friendly to enter your treasured recipes handed down over the years or to capture new ones on the internet.  It takes the work out of planning a weekly menu and creates a shopping list for you!  I could go on and on but trust me, you'll love this program!!"
1,"good product, easy to use. all is good."
0,"In order to use the software you must first click a box and agree to the H&R BLOCK privacy policy, which is presented in a pop-up window.  The privacy policy presented to me allows H&R BLOCK to collect and use for their own business purposes, among other things, the following information about me and my family members:    \\""  - Social Security Number and other government identification numbers (e.g., EIN and ITIN)    - Date of Birth    - Financial Information (e.g., income, revenue, assets, credits, deductions, and expenses)    - Payment Data (e.g., checking, debit and credit card account numbers, balances and payment history)    - Health Information (e.g., health insurance status and financial information related to payment for healthcare services)\\""    I called the information number in provided in the policy for \\""questions or complaints regarding our privacy practices or principles,\\"" and I was in turn directed to call two additional numbers within H&R BLOCK.  None of the three customer service people I spoke with was prepared to explain the policy or answer my questions.    I see no reason why a software vendor should claim the right to collect and use this kind of highly-private information for their own commercial purposes.  I refused to agree to the policy and I am therefore seeking a refund for the software.  From now on I'll do my returns on my own and keep corporate America out of the loop."
0,I downloaded this for 39.99.  Very disappointed and surprised when to efile the first state was 24.99.  Free doesn't include efile. And then when I went to finish my second state it cost another 39.99 plus another 24.99 to efile it.  Meanwhile I had done a free federal for my mother at H&R block and to process her state and efile it cost ONLY 10!  I wil be rethinking my choices next year.
0,"The more I use the program, the less and less usable it becomes. I used to be able to just drag and drop sound files into the program, now I can't. I used to be able to use the vocal tuner, now it crashes when I try to do anything with it. I can't recommend any Magix Music Maker product; way too overpriced for how unresponsive and buggy it is."
0,"I an stuck in a continuous loop of updates needed before You can download the state program. When I called HR Block tech support , the guy told me to return to Amazon for a refund , then buy it from the HR Block website, otherwise they can not support it. What is this all about? Help ! I bought this download last year and had no problems."
1,I have used AVAST for nearly five years.  No sign of any intrusions during that period.  Doesn't seem to slow down my computer.  Just works in the background and is easy to customize.
1,"Quick Books is a very good product.  It simplifies things and keeps our accounts in order.  It is fantastic for budgeting, to keep track of the daily transaction and is user friendly. Our church really benefits from it."
1,"No other product comes close, i have tried Mcafee, AVG etc..this is a one install and forget. It keeps protecting your PC and not that hard on CPU usage."
1,"I have had no issues with this software; did not have urgent need to upgrade from V12 but there are a few new nice features and I figure it will help continue development of the software.  It does an astounding amount of things for the person willing to get into depth with it.<br />Photoshop: There are lots of tutorials out there for the Photoshop Elements software and it is very capable once you understand layers and how editing works (I can't claim to be an expert at all, but can get the results I need regularly).  There are websites devoted to this product also (e.g. photoshopelementsuser) and I figure it does 70-80% of the 'full' photoshop which I'll never take the time to master.<br />Premiere:  I've seen less info for the Premiere; however over the years I've found it to be a very capable video editor which can do a lot if you dig into it a bit.  I produce 5-10 videos a year for local charity, and find it works well for that purpose.  The V13 edition works well and I've done a couple of videos with it so far."
1,"I do love it. No regrets once I got my computer to sync with it. I have never quite understood this intense and sometimes idiotic rivalry between the Gates guys (now children of &#34;Baldy Balmer&#34;) and Job's junkies. Ah well, I have bigger fish to fry recognizing value to both systems. Eventually the stock market will declare the winner on these two heavyweights or maybe not ... Of course I'm coming from a 30 year career of using Windows pc-based but now operate full-time in retirement on a mac."
1,"Have not had any problems with virus's, we are also notified when there is a potential virus in incoming email."
0,"Over the years I've used many versions of MS Publisher and always loved it. The 2013 version however is disappointing. There are many, many gripes I have with this version. I particularly don't like trying to change any picture; with Publisher 2003 you just double clicked it and it took you straight to a last directory you used, click the new picture and you we're done. With Publisher 2013 you have to right click the picture, select change picture, select change picture once more, select browse and force it to go your local directory, select the new picture and then without asking it puts a copy of the old picture off page and zooms back out to whole page view with both the old and new pictures selected. Terrible! What used to be quick is now slow and laborious. You'll end up continuously zooming back in to adjust the picture you were working on. There are no options to turn off this awful feature off. I honestly regret purchasing this version of Publisher."
0,"Good bye TurboTax.  It was a good run for us.  I was one of your early adopter, loyal customers for over twenty years.  I started with your product on floppy disks for heaven sakes.  Your greed has now pushed me away.  I'll miss you but H&R Block will get my business this year. Netflix got themselves into the same predicament a year or so ago and then quickly re-thought their corporate marketing strategy after customers left in droves. Just wait till your customers who haven't read these reviews get into the middle of their taxes and find out they have to upgrade. Where Netflix had little competition and many of their customers returned, yours' will not. I would love to be a fly on your boardroom wall right now.    Update: Well I took the plunge and purchased H&R Block today.  It installs easily, is cheaper than TurboTax and seamlessly imports you TT files.  For all of you folks like me that were afraid of going to a different tax software after twenty years with Intuit, don't worry there is virtually no learning curve in moving to H&R Block."
0,"got the free federal e-file, but got charged for the MA. state e-file which they claimed was free.$19.99"
1,Simply the best!
0,"If you don't have ISO stock option exercise, then the Deluxe version might be just for you. But if you do and need to calculate AMT tax due to the difference in exercise price and fair market price, then there is no way to enter that in the software. Neither the dialogue prompts you (there are several unrelated ISO option questions), nor can you directly enter the amount in the tax form 6251 for AMT. This can be a major shortcoming if you need to do that.<br /><br />I am not sure if Premium version has that. Maybe you can try that but it is a dismay that the software does not even provide a manual way to enter that."
0,Not as advertised!!! Is not an antivirus program!!
1,For years i have used turbo tax premier at a much higher cost.  i see no sense into going back to turbo tax.  This was less expensive and worked just as well even with dealing with stock sales.
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for years and love the convenience. This makes a chore that I dread every year, as do most Americans, at least manageable. Tasks are automated and, once you do it, the software imports your information from previous tax returns. You can also import so of the W2 and 1099 info right from the internet. The E-File option is also very helpful."
0,"Even the Toast 11 most updated version still freezes, and I have to restart then freezes again.<br />Toast 10 with OS X 10.7 was better."
1,It takes care of my desktop with out any thing for me to do.  I am glad a friend told me about avast
1,Good price for the product. I was happy that it caught my excess social security. The program makes tax preparation fast and easy
1,I was very happy with this purchase. Importing worked perfectly. E-file was a breeze. I recommend this program to anyone even novices should find this fairly easy.
0,"Pathetic that you need to pay a monthly subscription to use software, and not have an option to buy it."
1,"I've used Quicken for several years now and always found it to be more complicated then it needs to be. I decided to try one of the other financial software programs found online as it was cheaper with free upgrades forever. Turned out to be a waste of time and money. So, I'm back to Quicken. Fortunately I had no problems with the download process or transitioning from the 2010 version. It's still not as good as the old Microsoft Money program, but seems to be the only game in town."

0,"My kids like this program. It's a &#34;good enough&#34; solution. The program functions like an older Windows XP app, but we run it on Windows 8.1"
0,"Really Microsoft? Really?  Are you just trying to run off all of your young family market segment to Apple who gives away their versions of Word and Excel for free????  You make it SO DIFFICULT to vet a 2nd grader K-12 student!!!  Obviously kids in these grades DO NOT have college .EDU domaine email addresses - DA! And they don't have school ID's. So, I had to scan in my 2nd grade child's report card to prove to you and wait 5 days for a email response it says.  HOW STUPID !!!! This was enough to make us consider chucking our entire Windows PC's and laptops and just buy Apple like all our young family friends are doing.<br /><br />NO WONDER MICROSFOT IS LOOSING MARKET SHARE DAILY TO APPLE. All because Microsoft had to get greedy and start price  nickel and diming customers to  make revenue (stock is up absurdly high for past 52 months over peers because of this). They used to give away Word and Excel with all Windows based operating systems. Oh and by the way - the updated enhancemetns of Word and Excel are INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT and UN-USER friendly to navigate !!!!!"
1,"I liked the program even when I could choose between only two fonts (I chose Times New Roman).  The program now has LOTS of fonts.  It's easy to use, and for my home use, is perfect for printing professional looking envelopes.  Well worth the money."
0,Very disappointed. Previous years were much easier to use and did not put you through a lot of frustration. I will look else where next year.
0,"This software works as a legal alternative to a &#34;virus-cluttered&#34; converter. The only thing I needed it for was to convert some of the songs I have into .ogg files for Trackmania 2 Canyon. When imported the songs into the game, it did show up in the &#34;custom music tab&#34; but, when I selected the now converted .ogg file, the custom music wouldn't play.<br /><br />This software is good for other converting situations, but not this situation. Sorry."
1,I went from v8 to v12 and it's sooooo much better.
0,"Two stars because I actually like Ai; I think its ridiculous that Adobe has gone in this direction. I almost purchased this not realizing that it would be charged each and every year.

0,"If you are thinking of trying to import 2013 tax data from TurboTax  Business (estates. partnerships, LLCs), forget it. This software (with all updates) will not import. Further, the customer support is horrible. I waited for an hour for voice support - no answer. I did get a webchat started (after an hour wait), but  the import problem was not addressed and the technician was not helpful in any way. Also, this software cannot import Quickbooks or Quicken data. Not worth buying."
0,"I&#34;m disappointed with turbo tax having used it for over 20 years with no problems. Bought Deluxe version thinking it was the same as last year, Not true had to upgrade twice to get all forms needed. Ended up with Home and Business with an additional upcharge of $ 40.00 from Deluxe version.<br />These guys have really disappointed me with the upgrades and difficult point of sale information I will look at other software next year.<br /><br />What&#34;s wrong with these dopes? Oh Yea if you want the $ 25.00 for the mess they created go fill out another form!!!"
0,"After months of Intuit's dire &#34;Your connected services will be discontinued&#34; countdown, I finally gave in and purchased the upgrade to Quicken Deluxe 2015.  I have been on Quicken 2015 for less than a day so I will keep my points short for now.  I will revise my review over then next few weeks as i put 2015 through more real use.  First the downside...  1) From what i can see so far, the money I just paid for Quicken 2015 is a SUBSCRIPTION fee to keep using my Quicken product and NOT an UPGRADE.  The look and feel and functionality appear to be almost identical to what I have been working with in the 2012 version for the past few years.  Not much new and exciting here.  Next, the installation definitely had some scary bumps.  Like when I got an error message in accessing my Intuit ID.  The text of the error message told me to &#34;go back&#34;, but there was NO OPTION TO ACTUALLY DO THAT.  I had to kill the install and start over.  On my third try it magically decided to work.  Oh yes, then there is tech support, or more accurately TEXT-support.  I tried to open a chat with support, only to be told that the wait time was about 3 hours.  Turns out that a tech came online after about 30 minutes... but after about 60 seconds of waiting for a reply from me... the tech declared that I was inactive and closed the session.  One last complaint... when I maximize quicken the view breaks. As long as I am manually sizing the window it scales OK but once I actually go to full screen it adjust to a zoom that if far too larger to fit on my screen and it does not let me adjust or re-size parts of the window.  So why the three stars... answer is simple, the most important stuff seems to be working.  My data came across intact and my online updates seem to be working so far.  In the 2012 version online updates were OK *most* of the time but they were far from 100% stable.  If 2015 improves on the reliability of online updates... my rating will go up.  If those updates explode... I will probably be DONE with Quicken (not to mention Intuit, considering this years Turbo Tax debacle)."
1,"Once Avast is set up and running, I have to pay little attention to it. I can't think of preventable problems with any of my programs or my OS that I could ascribe to any slip-ups in the antivirus service."
1,Even better than my old version.
1,"I'm surprised by the negative reviews.  My kids have been using this for about 2 years - we've had no software problems, ever (windows computer).  They say it is sometimes hard but they think it pushes them.  They did not initially understand the purpose of some of the exercises but now they do."

1,Great product.  Cloud sync is a great feature. I waited until all the original problems were worked out and updated  before purchase.
1,Excellent!
1,Great bang for your buck! Has blocked various problems that I was completely unaware of. You also have the option to upgrade which is still way cheaper than other programs.
0,I bought MOVAVI suite v.14 to record free instructional videos from my computer.  These video run all day for 1 day only.  I would set movavi to record for 8 hours then stop.  IT CRASHES AFTER 6.5 HOURS and I loose everything.  NO WAY TO RECOVER VIDEO.  Their tech support has been of no help.  DO NOT BUY THIS APPLICATION.  It is a waste of money.
1,"The service is affordable, easy to use, and the customer service has been very helpful as I've grown my business. For a small business owner with many more things to worry about than payroll, it's ideal."
0,"I purchased H&R Block 2014 this year.  Just like the majority of past customers...I found Intuit's &#34;apologies&#34; insulting and their business practices appalling.  Their products, TurboTax & Quicken, have just been horrible over the past several &#34;upgrades&#34;.  I'm hanging on to Quicken 2012 because anything beyond that is a joke.  INTUIT, WAKE UP!"
0,"Started working on 2014 taxes and realized Intuit had removed the K-1 forms from TurboTax Deluxe and want me to upgrade to TurboTax Premiere for the same functionality I have used for the past 15 years. I then read their explanation that it was to add consistency across their product line. It would seem adding this functionality to the products that did not have it would be adding consistency. This is just trying to take more of my money. I have used TurboTax because it was familiar, but this has motivated me to look at other tax software solutions. I will probably re evaluate Quicken next."
1,I think it's an old program for Creative Sound Blaster app. Not necessary unless you have a Creative Program on your computer.<br />It's only a download and I've already lost mine on a system re-install. It's not on a disc to install. just download.
1,"First- the Amazon software downloading process is absolutely awesome, and if anyone thinks they need to clutter their home with one more box and DVD, well, you might give this a try!<br /><br />Secondly,  the program works well.  I purchased it because it seemed that IBank chose to give me fits every now and then and I simply needed a better way to track my finances.  At the end of the month when it came time to reconcile IBank would have either missed something and there were balance issues.  So far, Quicken Essentials has performed exactly as promised, with no errors and it is well worth the transition.  The interface of downloading my bank details is easy and seamless.  I am very satisfied with tht e product.<br /><br />I know I read lots of chatter that people think this is somehow \\""less complete\\"" a version of Quicken but it meets and exceeds everything I have asked it to do in the month that I have owned it!  This works well for my macbook pro so I am pleased!"
