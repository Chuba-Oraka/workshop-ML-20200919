The film is not pornographic, or pornographic for its own sake, using just enough to affirm the power of Sade's appeal and compulsion. Everything else aside, the gem of the film is the depiction of Sade's compulsive behavior: relentless, purposeful, never reflective, unstoppable under impossible circumstances. The film takes place in a mental hospital, where Sade has been confined by officialdom in the hope his volatile influence on French culture will be eliminated (and a progressive pastor/superintendent hopes he may be reformed). But he must write and publish his pornography. Sade will find a way despite every possible effort by the officials to remove any ability. Again and again, just when you think he can't possibly find a way, he does, an in ways that richly illustrate Sade's utter, devouring compulsion. The effect is powerful.

It does have a lot of action and intensity at times but does not quite come up to the standards of other westerns of that time period (1960s) such as John Wayne and Randolph Scott movies, etc for example. The film does feature a story-line told from the Native American Indian point of view, however, not all actual Native Americans were used in every role in the film.

What a great summer movie to fend off the stress and obsessions of the modern age for a couple hours.  I grew up in the 70s, not the 60s, but things were much the same in my time as in this movie.  We played baseball in the field behind the houses across the street.  Two neighbors had &#34;ferocious&#34; dogs that terrified the whole block.  The old woman across the street wouldn't let us on her lawn to get a ball.  I rode my Schwinn to little league at the fields behind the schools in my home town of Lincolnwood, IL.  Monday Night Baseball was a highlight of the TV week (we only had 5 or 6 channels).  On hot summer nights I'd secret away into the only room in our house with AC and watch it, but only after hours of swimming at the pool just like in the movie.  Sometimes we'd swim all day, then go home for dinner (lunch consisted of a slice of frozen pizza or a hot dog with BBQ chips from the pool concession stand) only to return to the pool fore PM swim until 9 if I had no baseball game.  And we could ride our bikes home alone, age 10 or 12, without much care.  This movie reminds me of a simpler time, long before the all-consuming technologies that now rule our world with an iron fist.  No internet, no hackers, no cell phones, no cameras on every corner.

I was really excited when this was coming out on television. I faithfully watched every episode. It was a nice surprise that the network did not try to turn it into a 'soap' in a ratings grab. Because these people are real life portrayals, it might have been hard to have them do something 'too crazy'.<br /><br />At the dawn of the space race, these women had it all--the looks, the husbands with the excellent jobs and the ideal homes. But everybody was unprepared for the accompanying challenges and stresses. Women wanted to sleep with their husbands. Reporters followed them everywhere also. And Trudy Cooper was honestly devastated to learn that in spite of her own impeccable flying credentials, NASA is not going to seriously send women  up into space. A training program for women is cancelled. But rather than putting up with this type of treatment from her husband--who in his defense, is as much a product of the times as others--she divorces him.<br /><br />Of course being a series set in the early to mid 1960's, there is a episode about the Kennedy assassination. Being the spouses of government employees, these women have a different perspective than the rest of the country. Their families lost the person who ultimately makes executive orders for federal agencies--including the then still relatively new NASA.  And he was the commander in chief.<br /><br />If I had one critique of the series, it is that the storyline was too condensed. There was so much more to tell.  Because this was merely a summer 'mini series' monumental events were not properly spaced out over several weeks.

Every character seems legit.  The two female leads are incredibly powerful--finally!  The sine qua non of Elliot and Angela's parents being killed by nefarious (Enron nodding) Evil Corp as motivation for their individual actions makes for a good revenge story.  But of course this story is expanded into a loftier scheme by the sheer force of an outlier's anger against the zeitgeist in the lone hacker in Elliot.  His scheming is motivated by astute aspergerian observations of the sufferings of the common man and the unfairness it represents generally--this is something to which nearly every pitiful, disenfranchized, merely-survivng pleb in modern society can easily relate.  MR ROBOT thus represents a new take on the antihero with heroic qualities.  As a linux user and web dev who immediately recognizes what hacking activities are being shown (routine linux commands), it's extremely refreshing to see a drama that represents hacking more realistically.

Owen Wilson fans will be pleased by his ample screen presence, which essentially rescues this misshapen mess. The failure of She's Funny is that She (the protagonist) actually isn't funny; nothing against Imogen Poots necessarily, it's the script that was off.<br /><br />She's Funny has its moments, yet they are few and far between (the existential cab driver was a decent idea, but only provides reprieve for a heartbeat).

The whole premise is tedious. I only watched because Amazon keeps shoving ads and links everywhere I go to come have a look. What a waste of time. Delaney and Horgan are better writers than actors. This is like watching one sketch comedy skit after another, strung into these tedious episodes.  Horgan and Delaney simply are not strong enough or talented enough to carry episode after episode of what is essentially a movie of the week.   Two average middle aged people hook up in a bar for a one night stand. Naturally, she is pregnant. (Surprise!) Couldn't we all have seen this coming? And they naturally do what all irresponsible middle aged people do--they get married. Throw in some precocious students (she's a teacher) and some odd ball pals of his and off they go. Oh, there's some snappy dialogue, I give them that. And Horgan and Delaney seem to have  a certain chemistry. There's lots of bedroom chats, often in the dark and usually before or after sex. Plenty of F bombs to keep the adult theme intact...and more. And there are the now seemingly routine and required sex scenes. All I can say it it's nothing we having seen many, many times before.  Why any one would find either of these people sexually attractive is beyond me to begin with. Delaney looks to be working on a double chin for goodness sake.

Ah well . . . luckily, the movie prompts us to more substantive reflection too, and Wood's character, Debbie, is not so much a character (for no acting is required of her here) as an icon, the object of the search, and it's what motivates the searchers Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) that comes to matter as much as the rigors of the search itself.  The setting, ostensibly West Texas, but actually filmed largely around Monument Valley in Utah, as so many of John Ford's movies were, is 1868, and Ethan Edwards has been gone from home for eight years.  What has he been doing since the end of the Civil War (in which he fought on the Confederate side)?  He seems to have been a mercenary in Mexico, and it's hinted that he might even have some criminal activity in his past, but his old friend Samuel Johnson Clayton (Ward Bond) doesn't push it.  What becomes clear early is that his long absence might have to do with his affections for his brother's wife, which is made clear in an understated way, and that he has returned a racist, as we would now say.  Perhaps he always has been, but now the idea of miscegenation between Indian (Comanches in this part of the world) and white folks deeply disturbs him, and when his niece, Debby, is taken after an Indian attack that leaves his brother and family dead, the search for her becomes a search to purify her by killing her --- for Ethan assumes, correctly as it turns out, that Debbie has grown up to become a wife of the raiding Comanche chief, Scar.  John Wayne gives a performance here that matches at least his great performance as another kind of obsessive in &#34;Red River.&#34;  We tended to think, late in Wayne's life, that he simply played versions of himself, but that does him an injustice.  Parts were written for him of a certain kind, and he played them as a professional actor should, but he was capable of doing more than he was often given to do, and a movie like this shows it.<br /><br />Fortunately for Debbie, Ethan is accompanied by Martin, whom Ethan tends to look down on both for his youth and for the fact that Martin -- in effect an adoptive brother to Debbie -- is himself eighth-Indian.  And when the final confrontations come, Martin rises to the occasion . . . and, eventually, Ethan does too, but when he gets Debbie back to the settlement where she grew up, he seems himself to feel that it is no place for him.  The final shot is iconic, and by that time we realize that what Ford and Wayne have given us not just a stereotypical portrait of a &#34;loner&#34; but a nuanced account of a man who might realize that his attitudes can't survive in the nascent &#34;civilization&#34; that West Texas represents here -- it's a place that has a place for a person of mixed blood, like Martin, and it's a place where crazy folks like Mose Harper (Hank Worden) and &#34;foreigners&#34; like the Scandinavian settlers the Jorgensons, have a place too.  It's to the credit of Ford and his screenwriter Frank Nugent that they allow most of our grasp of the dynamics of the settlement to be conveyed more by image and gesture than by explicit dialogue and explanation -- which would be a problem for plausibility, given that we don't seem to be among very articulate people here.<br /><br />The movie was made in 1955, and it seems reasonable to assume that Ford is touching on the fears of many Southern whites especially at a time when the Civil Rights movement was taking off.  Brown v. Board of Education had been decided the previous year, and Dr. King was in Montgomery around the time of the filming.  Things were stirring, and Ford seems willing to keep them stirred.  The odd sub-plot of Martin's comic courtship of the Jorgensons' daughter Laurie (Vera Miles, not totally convincing)interwoven with the uncomfortable comedy, if comedy it is, of Martin's acquiring an Indian wife, whom he calls &#34;Look,&#34; in the course of the search is important.  Ethan finds it humorous -- so when the Indian maiden is the ostensible sexual object, he clearly has no qualms.  Laurie, on hearing about it in the labored single letter she gets from Martin, is obviously disturbed and becomes open to being courted by Charlie McCorry (Ken Curtis), a musician and a largely comic and non-sexual figure.  Martin and Ethan get back on Laurie's wedding day -- and the ending of that strand of the plot devolves into &#34;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&#34;-type comedy, but given what has gone before, we can't just sit back and enjoy it -- especially with Ethan and Debby in the picture.  The bottom line for me is that the movie still has the power to disturb, though whether in 2015 we're disturbed in the way that the audiences were sixty years ago seems questionable.  But where issues of race, justice, and empathy are concerned, any disturbance that prompts reflection is salutary.  So see this if you haven't already.uncomfortable comedy, if comedy it is, of Martin's acquiring an Indian wife, whom he calls &#34;Look,&#34; in the course of the search is important.

I thought, how utterly sad; but how wonderful (as I read) that Mr. Bogart was such an understanding and benevolent gentleman, who, when needed, often fed Miss Tierney her lines, as she had great difficulty in some scenes. The acting was somewhat understated, which, to me, made the roles all the more to be cherished an lauded in this day of violence, untoward behavior, and everything seemingly disturbed and evil.. I will watch this movie again, and that is how I know that I appreciate a film. Look at the beautiful Tierney and . . . well, I don't know what else to say, except just to see her made the film worthwhile for me.

Nick arcade is truly something special. Amazon has really done a wonderful service to us 80's-90's kids by making all these classic shows available to is again. I'm begging you, Amazon, PLEASE release more Nick Arcade packs like this!! (More Double Dare would be awesome too!) We'll pay anything for it!<br /><br />Ps.. Whoever is writing the episode descriptions for these shows is a genius. The descriptions of Phil Moore's outfits and things like the kid choking on Alpha Mission 2 had my bro and I in tears.

What attracted me to this show was the breakdown and rebuilding of a society during a disaster, and the possible supernatural tie-in. Season 2, I forgave, because most sophomore seasons are exposition-laden, wobbly and never really as good as the first. Season 3... Well, this season was very painful to watch. The dialogue was predictable and uninspired (Dean Norris, you have been robbed!), and the plot is super messy. It's as if the point of this season was to render all of season 2 moot, by essentially getting rid of characters and story lines that were prominent in it (what was the point of the Melanie character at all? Or Junior's Mom and that damn red door?) and using a warped-time line to force the plot into some other crazy direction.<br /><br />It seems the &#34;in thing&#34; to kill off main characters in shows these days, which is something I applaud: in my belief, the story should come first, not the actors' contracts or network's pocketbooks. But there are 3 deaths in the first two episodes that just didn't even need to happen. The story didn't move forward, or anywhere, because of those deaths. And, as a woman, I am against woman-shaming, but Marg Helgnberger's lips need some serious fixing. That's all I can think about in her scenes, and she has so very many scenes! SPOILER ALERT: I am only sticking around because I heard the dome comes down this season. With one episode left, it better!  I don't think I'll be back to watch this next year. Stephen King, you've disappointed me here, but I will buy the book. It has to be a million times better than the show!<br /><br />9/8/15 Update: yay!

Zac Efron stars as Cole, an aspiring DJ dreaming of fame and fortune while living in a San Fernando Valley pool house, earning a modest living dealing drugs and cold-calling people in foreclosure at a shady real-estate firm.  He and his childhood friends (Jonny Weston, Shiloh Fernandez, Alex Shaffer) live fast and play hard to avoid recognizing their complacency and the resulting encroachment of mediocrity.  An encounter with a veteran producer (Wes Bentley) and his girlfriend slash assistant (Emily Ratajkowski), however, may represent a chance to ignite Cole's career in music if he can navigate and overcome a treacherous fusion of ambition, desire, and loyalty.<br /><br />Most of the drama here is on the contrived and predictable side.  Anyone who has ever watched a film knows Cole will sleep with his jaded mentor's girlfriend, and the secret will be revealed in time for a third-act confrontation.  There is also an eleventh-hour twist of tragedy; it rings false and seems harshly shoehorned in, as if a studio executive became nervous regarding the picture's otherwise largely cavalier attitude toward recreational drug use.  And despite the title, the friends are interchangeable bros and arguably the least interesting part of the film.<br /><br />Yet despite its flaws, We Are Your Friends is fun!  A quality which should not be undervalued.  First-time feature director Max Joseph recently completed a short documentary on the history of  DFA Records, the label co-founded by LCD Soundsystem mastermind James Murphy, and he infuses this film with a genuine respect for dance music, the technique required to create it, and the euphoria it can inspire.  He crafts the picture as an earnest, sentimental invitation to a mainstream audience to consider beats per minute, sampling, and the experience of standing in front of hundreds or thousands of people armed only with a laptop.  Joseph also proves an aggressive stylist, and the swirling visual experience—one drug-fueled party is depicted with psychedelic animation; hand-held cameras dart and zoom through thronging crowds of people gyrating and becoming one with the Day-Glo—and his heavy hand suits and elevates the content.<br /><br />There are also a trio of charismatic performers at the center of the story.  Efron, who I have long felt possesses a genuine movie-star magnetism beyond his initial claim to fame as a Mouse House heartthrob, is handsome, wide-eyed, and easy enough to invest in.  Bentley plays what could be an entirely antagonistic role in a sympathetic, almost haunted way; by refusing to twirl a proverbial mustache, he brings a degree of humanity to the aforementioned flawed-mentor arc/contrivance  And in one of her first acting roles, Ratajkowski, one of the most famous supermodels in the world at the moment due in part to her involvement in the &#34;Blurred Lines&#34; video, is not only incredibly sexy, but an authentic and warm presence.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,1

It wasn't that good!&#34; and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.<br /><br />After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.<br /><br />The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).<br/><br />Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

Introduced as a means of providing an alternative to increasing oil consumption and reducing pollution in 1996, the electric car was an all-but-forgotten memory only a decade later.But why? Through interviews with consumer advocacy experts, automotive industry experts, and oil industry heavyweights, Payne paints a thought-provoking picture of a culture whose aversion to change and reliance on dwindling resources may be rooted in the financial concerns of a wealthy few, and may also be leading consumers down a troubling path.<br /><br />This documentary about General Motors' development and withdrawal of the innovative, environment-friendly EV1 automobile is bound to reverberate with anyone who's fallen in love with a product only to see it irrevocably yanked from the market.But nevertheless,it is an entertaining if slightly skewed documentary about the short life and early death of General Motors' EV1 - the electric car.",2015-08-27,1.0,True,1

I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960’s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved “U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special” faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!

Worse yet, the shadows are alive and are trying kill everyone. On paper, Vanishing on 7th Street sounds like a sure fire win for a horror movie. It plays on the natural fear of the dark many people have, has plenty of mystery that keeps you engaged, and it has a fairly solid cast with the likes of Christensen (who shouldn't be judged by the poor script he had in the Star Wars prequels), Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Sadly, while the film does have some decent scares and manages to maintain some level of tension. It never fully achieves the potential it sets itself up for. Between hokey CGI shadow effects, hackneyed usage of true historical mysteries with easy explanations that blow the film's supposed explanation out of the water, and truly stupid character decisions the film feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode (and given that show actually had an episode about killer shadows that was AMAZING makes this film look all the more worse). Add onto that, a truly stupid ending with obvious biblical undertones and a shot that rips off the iconic image of The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes riding his horse down an abandoned highway and you have the mediocre strawberry on a truly disappointing cake.<br /><br />Not to mention, it's way too easy to make &#34;Dark side of the force&#34; jokes throughout the entire film's run time.

Another great film is &#34;The Secret of Trees.&#34;  We are amazed how a 13-year old invented a way to harness solar energy by aligning solar panels in the same pattern as leaves on trees.  The leaves follow the  Fibonacci Sequence, a recurring mathematical formula in nature.  Yet another is &#34;You don't know Jack.&#34;  This film showcases the research by another teenager who is fervently working on developing a cure for pancreatic cancer.  We need more programming like this to inspire youth to pursue creativity in science.  We can't wait to watch Season 2!",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

For example I have not seen &#34;Platoon&#34; or &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34;...and have to plans to see them.  I watched this because a friend insisted I had to see Bradley Cooper's performance.  So let me start there.  Cooper gives a very strong, very understated nuanced performance.  It's very difficult to play someone who by nature is an introvert.  Two or three times maybe Cooper has one or two lines that give us an insight into the real-life man he's playing, but that's it.  His best work is done while his finger is on the trigger, trying to determine whether a mother or her child need to be taken out because they're carrying a concealed weapon.  In fact those are the best scenes in the movie.  Unfortunately Eastwood goes back to it a couple times too many.  After a while it seems like we've seen this scene already...is that all you've got?  Seriously by the time we got to the &#34;fourth tour&#34; ...was there anything left to say?  Sienna Miller was ...ok...but there wasn't much for her to do.  None if the myriad questions regarding our involvement in this war are even brought up.  The most interesting aspect of the movie to me, actually in the true life story as well...is why one veteran killed another, especially this one.  That might have made a better movie, but it seems like Eastwood, for whatever reason, didn't want to spend that much time on this.  This isn't a political review.  I am in no position to judge whether or not this man is a hero.  I just wish the movie about him had been better. Make me want to read the book maybe.

She is striking poses that supposedly are sultry etc. So that was the focus of the movie. I thought it was all silly. And I don't think she is the idea of beauty.<br /><br />Anyway there is also the return of the long haired Tom Cruise. He was so all American looking in MI I. So cute and thin/healthy looking. Then here he starts that long hair thing. Flipping it around. Looks goofy. He also had a rather stoic performance in this one. Some lines were delivered in a rather deliberate way instead of an acting way. Again it was almost like the filming/producing was bad. There were the silly fight/chase scenes. Too impossible even for MI. And you can see the guy just stand there anticipating the hit before he falls down. Just goofy.<br /><br />And there was the lead villain guy who either looked or was made to look like a serpent with metal teeth. Just odd. And distracting.",2015-08-26,0.5,False,0

Overall, the vibe that comes across is not one of stylized animated action movie, but angry art school project dragged out to 90min.<br /><br />Why, you might ask, have I started this review with so much focus on the art?  Simple.  The story makes no attempt to stand up on its own.  All characters in the story are wholly unlikable, and make a concerted effort to prevent your forming any sort of connection with them.  Some might say that this was done to make a statement, or even draw a political allegory about materialism and the cheapening of life.  The problem with this argument, is that it's better communicated when you wouldn't rather have all the characters die in a fire 10min in.<br /><br />Please note that I have given this movie 2 stars, not because it deserves the second one (it doesn't), but because I couldn't be bothered to make it past the first 20 minutes.

Turns out the movie has a thin plot to carry jokes so crude and immature they normally wouldn't be able to get away with it. This was not insightful, was not creative, was not well done. Spoiler alert: average-Joe solder and a prostitute are frozen as part of a military experiment. Thin plot point about the military forgetting they're there and bulldozing the facility to make way for a crudely named facility. The pair wakes up 500 years later when the English language has devolved into a series of grunts and crude/derogatory slang. The &#34;whole world&#34; has suffered from this reverse darwinism where now the prostitute and the 100IQ solder are the smartest people &#34;on earth&#34;, because, you know, the United States of America IS the whole world - who else matters, right? There is some gladiator-meets-monster-trucks style gore, a lot of butt jokes and people getting kicked in the balls... every business from Starbucks to KFC has turned into innuendos and prostitution.  Generally, Idiocracy  makes &#34;The Interview&#34; and &#34;Super Troopers&#34; look clever, insightful, and mature. I like a good &#34;B&#34; movie but this was pretty fail.

Yet The Strain maintains a basic charm that can keep you watching for awhile.  It manages to entertain at times despite its flaws.<br /><br />Fear the Walking Dead obviously isn't going to find a way to drag the beginnings of the outbreak out over an entire season - we're already there at the end of the pilot.  The backstory for these characters is therefore given a mercifully shorter time to play out.  This would seem to be a positive thing.  But I already don't like the main characters in a much shorter time it took than in The Strain.<br /><br />Still, the writing, the characterization, the costuming, the casting - in appearance, the actors might be quite good given better writing - seem to have come out of a made for TV movie or after school special.  We're fed so many stereotypical bits throughout this episode, the teen daughter having the bathroom door opened on her and saying something teen-daughtery - the husband under the sink doing the plumbing, etc.<br /><br />It's as if the writers were just ticking off a list on a clipboard and announcing, see now you have to care.  It's extremely obvious and ineffective.<br /><br />There's a couple very heavy-handed themes being played here such as:<br />--the indispensable American Family coming together as a family<br />--gosh it's hard being a divorced parent<br /><br />The mother's character seems to be the worst because in thespace of one episode she has to be so many contradictory things that can't coexist in a human being unless they're unhinged.  Is she blindly trusting of Authority - taking her flu shot, saying there's nothing wrong because the authorities would tell her - or is she a do-it-yourself don't want the authorities involved type who checks out heroin dens with just her husband, takes care of kids with knives in school herself rather than letting them get caught?  Is she a tough as nails take charge High School counselor who has the years of experience and education for dealing with teens in various tough situations as well as years of experience with her own son's addiction, or is she the type to instantly wallow in sentimental angst looking at something she has seen MANY times, lingering in a dangerous place with no pragmatic thought in her head of safety for her and her husband?  Did they initially write parts for two or three different characters and then try to consolidate them, have the wife do all of them?<br /><br />What is it with zombie shows and backstories being excruciatingly, torturously boring and annoying?<br /><br />LOST would probably be the gold standard for backstories.  The secret is simple - they made the backstories themselves INTERESTING.  They were little finely-constructed stories within themselves.  It was done so well it almost distracted us from realizing the story arc was non-existent.  The writers clearly didn't say &#34;now we have to do the obligatory background filler&#34; as both Fear the Walking Dead and The Strain's writers clearly DID think.<br /><br />If you don't make the backstories interesting, you're better off leaving them out entirely.  Instead of feeling that something in these people's lives will be lost in the coming zombie outbreak, I find myself hoping it will come and obliterate their narcissistic, stereotypical lives.<br /><br />This is somewhat worse than The Strain, so I'm going to have to go back and give that one another star and take back some of what I said fairly soon.",2015-08-29,0.7058823529411765,False,0

Four different parents with children in four different sports are followed by the camera crews, who also interview the parents directly about their methods -- but not the children. This glaring omission, along with the absence of interviews with the children's coaches and the coparents, leaves the documentary feeling half-formed. What we get from the parents themselves is a sad combination of delusion and obsession. Tennis mom believes she's made a pact with God for her two sons to become tennis titans. It's unclear if they've achieved any success on the court, and whether they are actually interested in tennis. Golf dad follows his daughter from hole to hole, scribbling notes and muttering under his breath about her awful performance; she excels when he's not around. Basketball dad has supposedly quit whatever employment he had going on to micromanage his son. And football dad is just a straight-up sociopath who should probably invest in counseling before his son needs some. The behavior of this father in particular almost demanded an interview with the mother, so viewers could get some insight as to what could have possibly prompted her to allow her son to live with this man. The conclusion of the film hinted at a longer version out there somewhere, so that should be noted, and provided information about what happened to these kids.  I hope the longer version includes some insight from coaches on whether or not this invasive parenting ever emerges as helpful, and how other parents can work with coaches and help their children achieve their dreams without crushing them.",2015-08-25,1.0,True,0

While he’s in it, it’s really just a Suicide Squad movie that’s prepped for a follow-up. I can forgive that from another DC title Batman: Year One, which was largely about someone other than Batman (Jim Gordon) because it felt like the characters were so intertwined.  Batman was an afterthought in Assault on Arkham.  Second, the script needs to cook more. I get what they’re thinking: DC’s audience has grown up and there’s been 3 successful Christian Bale movies. So where else could they go? Yet this one feels like something a writer put together that then got “tweaked” to DC’s broader effort.  They can’t be tone deaf to what’s going on around it in animation or with comic book movies, but I strongly suspect an earlier draft was much clearer and more cogent.  Third: it's darker. It’s much more violent, more sex, more boobs, and more pointless kills. It’s crude and a little callous, playing closer to the logic in many Jason movies where, the more interesting kill, the better. There’s little conscience here and I’m not sure what the story was.  Sure, everyone’s familiar with cartoons for adults now, but Batman doesn’t make the transition smoothly. Plus, although they place a character in the group that’s ostensibly the (sort of) good guy, I didn’t find anyone to root for here.  Fortunately, it’s not as bad as the creepy Batman vs. Robin film.  PROS:  The art, design, animation, action sequences, etc. are all top-notch.  The voice actors all did great and kudos to the director who put together something with some real style and flavor as a lot of animated features feel a little too close to their shot list.  Also, when the villain characters have a chance to escape, they turn on each other. It felt honest to the story, to the characters, and I’m pleased they didn’t give in to the temptation to promote them all to Good Guys to skip past the confusion of everyone splitting up.  Also, unlike other DC titles, the characters are not treated like The Next Potential Awesome Thing and can die.   CONS  There are some very familiar characters here and probably too many.  There’s Killer Croc (a.k.a. shark guy), Two Guys That Do Martial Arts Or Something, Captain Boomerang (seriously), and Mrs Freeze. Oh and Harley.  Give the women big boobs and borderline stripper outfits and cram in a requisite &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34; slow walk of bad guys that doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.  Since it’s really hard to work with this many characters and lots of ins and outs, the 3rd act ends up blurry and convoluted. For instance, what happened to the files The Riddler was threatening to release? Does anyone care?  Then there's nothing interesting with the setting: every other Batman I've seen has at least tried to give some credit to the Lovecraftian roots, where this movie makes it just a standard prison.  Arkham doesn’t feel like a real place, more of a cardboard, stand-up locale where the story happens.  The guards are the sort of paper maché bowling pins that get knocked down, taking away the sense that the Squad is an amazing group of specialists, and more just colorful thugs.  Finally and most painfully the Joker -- one of the best villains in comic books (and a few other places) -- is poorly represented here by an unfunny, dull, violent caricature.  I don't envy the writer/director who has to contend with the very high bar set by previous Batman efforts, but we deserve more.   GOOFINESS  While I can handle ignoring how many bullets are in a clip (that’s in here) but this one just makes up the rules as it goes along.  For some reason there’s a bazooka in the Arkham basement, all the major Batman villains make an appearance and of course have all their neat stuff (no explanation necessary) with Bane loaded with his equipment to get super pumped instantly. Also he’s bulletproof.  Then Poison Ivy’s kiss makes zombies now and she has a bunch of huge flower monsters. The Scare Crow gets a crazy claw thing for some reason.  None of that turns into anything because we only have 75 mins to cram all this stuff in.   SUMMARY  On my Christmas wish list is for DC to put down the energy drinks.  Stop putting a guy on the production team who says “nobody cares about the story, we need more explosions!”  Didn’t the Nolan movies make it clear you could have something a little more cerebral? Instead, I feel like they’re following Michael Bay’s suggestion that every movie should be targeted to 15-20 year old males. While that’s a safe bet for making dough, do you really think anyone’s going to watch those lame Transformer movies in 10 years? By contrast, I just re-watched the Batman the Animated Series movies from back in the 90s and it held up beautifully.  This movie also suffers from it's contrast to stronger fare coming out of the same studio.  More effort put toward projects like Batman: Year One -- an honest, personal, and unique story with flawed characters that I really cared about -- would definitely grab my time and attention.  .  Assault on Arkham needed fewer characters and more story.",2015-08-26,0.6666666666666666,False,0

If you come here to see a revenge movie (as which the movie clearly markets itself), don't. Its focus is on how poor immigrants suffer from the evil of the (American) White Man, presented with the subtlety and intelligence of an agitprop movie.  Part of what worked in Taken was that Liam Neeson was both likable, and credible as an experienced fighting machine. Eckhart's father is written - by an (ethnic) non-American - as a dumb cliche of the American Man: he lives in beautiful Europe, and all he can think of to do with his daughter is to watch baseball; and he feeds her nuts and so almost kills her despite an allergy that *a CIA agent living to be extremely detail-oriented* would have taken due note of. Contrary to the calm resolve of Neeson, Eckhart is hurried and hunted and out of breath the entire friggin movie.  The few fights are like 50s Western: two guuuuuuys hitting each other over and over, but no one breaks even as much as a finger or bites or scratches which, if you did any contact sport, you know is the kind of thing you go for. There is one fight that turns a bit more decisive, but overall, the fights are a true bore and not realistic in the least. And after, as the daughter stays with Daddy, it's always &#34;I'm so sorry, daughter!&#34; times. The movie targets the middle-class that used to be busy protesting Bush's wars as its ample trite social commentary shows, delivering the interracial happy ending (between the daughter and some guy you saw briefly 3 times before) that you, I am sure, were so waiting for.

First, I head to every sporting goods store and stock up on firearms and ammunition.  I buy bows and arrows.  Hunting knives.  Camp stoves.  Batteries of every shape and size -- including every car battery I can afford.  I then find the nearest Walmart and start stocking up on canned and dried goods, not to mention all the other day to day stuff one would like to have on hand.  There is more I would do.....but what do these people do?  Explore the wall....wonder about split cows and crashed planes, and wander in circles.<br /><br />This show is a train wreck of bad writing.  But I just keep watching, wondering what weird direction some character will take in the next episode.  First, Jr. is a sociopath who chains is girlfriend up in a bomb shelter to &#34;save&#34; her.  Now he's a hero.  First, Big Jim is a good guy trying to keep things together, then he's a councilman supporting a drug dealer, then he's just an idiot.  Now he's a sociopath. Big Jim actually expresses more multiple personalities than most criminals trying to use a multiple personality defense.  Every character in this show is all over the place.  We never know what personality trait a character might develop next.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the acting is great, and the underlying story line seems solid (as I'd expect with Stephen King), it's just that each episode seems to have forgotten what the last set forth.  I'm astounded crap like this gets three or four seasons when extremely well written shows barely survive a year.  Must be the King and Spielberg names.....<br /><br />Can't blame Stephen King for making money....but if I were him, I'd be embarrassed to have my name attached to this mess.",2015-08-31,0.75,False,0

Yet another dismal attempt at movie-making by QT,"If you enjoy gratuitous gore and violence, Quentin is your man.  He should have been a forensic pathologist, not a movie director.  I watched this to see what all the fuss was about, why Pulp Fiction was highly regarded as a cult genre, and why QT is highly regarded as a film director.  I came away thinking about the Emperor's Clothes, the story where everyone was afraid to look foolish for stating the obvious that the Emperor was naked.  Finally a child speaks up, and dares to say what everyone does not.<br /><br />This is a movie that jerks you back and forth in time, with staccato story lines, and vignettes of drama about people who waste their lives, living off each other as parasites, or killing for a living, sometimes for no reason at all.  People whose lives are full of petty, self-inflicted drama, ennui, and dissipation.  Painful to see life wasted like this.  Even more painful to sit through a film by QT.  Every single film by Quentin Tarantino is a colossal waste of my precious time.<br /><br />Uma Thurman's size 11 feet are yet another of QT's obsessions.  He must have a foot fetish.  Check out her feet in ‘Kill Bill’.  Travolta is revolting and dies that way too.  Samuel Jackson finds salvation. After shooting the life out of innumerable people.  This has credibility?<br /><br />Harvey Keitel had a tiny bad guy role, too small for his immense talent. Tim Roth just stares at you like he does on 'Lie To Me' and we are supposed to read depth in that.  Amanda Plummer is a crazed gun-toting hold up girl/friend.  Ho hum.  And QT himself has a cameo role as a whiney white guy.  The kind of whiney, obsessive-compulsive nerd he must have been growing up, to make movies this bad as an adult.<br /><br />At the end, you are left scratching your head about the story itself and what was the final conclusion.  You are left feeling scammed, as if you were robbed of your time without adequate compensation.  And you are left nauseated by the utterly empty useless lives you have been forced to witness, including that of QT.  If QT were a bug, I’d love to swat him with my fly swatter.  Swat!

A bunch of MBA wallstreet types sat around a long table and took turns blurting out the worst idea they could think off. I got an idea how about &#34;99 cheese pizza&#34;. &#34;Great idea, lets put some childish fart jokes in it too and also a flying skateboard.&#34; The flying skateboard may have worked in the cartoon but it doesn't work in a live action movie. It made the movie way over the top cheesy. The beatboxing in the elevator and making the turtles racist stereotypes of black people were terrible decisions. They tried to make the turtles into parodies of Cash Money / Young Money artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, Tyga, and all the other losers on that label that can't rap. The turtles are also supposed to be 4 feet tall and not giant bulky turtles. They're supposed to be ninjas that move swiftly like a cat not an giant bulky elephant making a lot of noise while stampeding through the fields. Making the turtles giant and bulky is the complete opposite of being a NINJA. And the worst part of all.... Donatello's hipster glasses and his giant ghost busters backpack. And Karai's hair looks like a cheap halloween wig. This movie had a budget of $125 million and they couldn't even bother to get a realistic looking wig. The casting is beyond ridiculous. Megan Fox? Will Arnett? Whoopi Goldberg? Sounds like the cast for a SNL TMNT parody.

All of Perry's trademarks that propelled her to stardom are replaced by this pathetic, disconnected attempt to be a superstar diva, and it's just sad and boring.  Her first tour was joyful, fun, energetic, youthful, personal, and whimsical.  Here from the costumes to sets, and from her staged remarks to the bizarre and dull musical arrangements it's just a huge Vegas-styled opus of a disaster. If I had paid to go to this concert, I would have walked-out, confused by the person and presentation on stage.  The fans in the audience look equally confused and bored; they are forced to zoom in a a couple of die-hard fans but alas even their hearts are not in it. I hope Katy goes back to being herself soon before she becomes yesterday's news.

The acting is uniformly excellent, the love interest (AV) is REALLY good, better than the blonde dope with the chipmunk cheeks and the dragons who likes to take her clothes off.<br /><br />MM is fantastic, and the guy who plays the King is great in a crucial role. The film wouldn't work without him being excellent.<br /><br />Also admirable are the production design and overall palette of the film. A lot of grays and creams, not many bright colors. The music by Gabriel Yared and another guy is also very good. All in all  a lot of production value for what must have been a modest budget.<br /><br />Particularly good is the way the director contrasts the life of the nobility with the lives of the peasants. He doesn't beat you over the head with it, which is refreshing. It will help to have a least a passing knowledge of the contemporaneous French Revolution (which is the elephant in the room, of course). If you know who Voltaire, Robespierre etc are, and what happened to much of the nobility, you will be in good shape.<br /><br />If you enjoy mad kings you might also enjoy &#34;Ludwig&#34; by Luchino Visconti.

But he struggles here, as in all his films, to keep focused.  He fails to build suspense, despite the Hitchcock-esque score by Gabriel Yared (which is hardly subtle.)  And he adds absolutely nothing to the character.  In particular, his descent into madness in the second half of the film is hard to watch because it's played like he's just taken an Acting for Beginners course.  No nuance, just straight-into-madness.  The connective tissue of the film is problematic as well, since some scenes feel like they were shot after the fact and plopped in for continuity.

YES theres obscene amounts of drugs sex and obnoxious characters but this film on a deeper level is so much more. The ending made me feel ripped off but when i sat and thought about it, it was a perfect ending. The man they called &#34;Wolfy&#34; is what some would call a genius in his own right. This movie is filled with abstract thought provoking undertones and adds a sense of gritty realism. The story is centered around the main DiCaprio's character and his DEVELOPMENT. Folks who watched this movie please think about this. What kind of man was Jordan Belfort at the beginning of the film compared to the end? Bring in money, power, fame, drugs, and what comes of him? It all started with his talent, a rare ability at that. The ability not only to sell, but get into minds PERSUADE, MANIPULATE individuals, and convert, control, and rally even crowds. Jordan's ability to do this for himself AND teach others to do the same is amazing and is a skill certainly overlooked and envied by many.<br /><br />This film is indeed about drugs, boobs, and inappropriateness; but its also the story of an innocent young hopeful with a gift, determined to make his dreams reality. whilst bombarded by the numerous vices that come with success. and it all started with his simple talent in sales. The movie ends as it does to show that &#34;genius&#34; is not only academic; and out of the many that want to do what Jordan can, only few are truly capable.

I made it 7 minutes and 55 seconds into the movie before I stopped it with repulsion. However, the one star, I can give is for the lack of music and quiet characters I saw in the almost 8 minutes. Life in those times wouldn't have a wonderful score to go with every emotion and meaningful glance or movement, and I suspect it would be a very quiet life with only the sounds of a house and nature to fill your mornings, evenings and probably much of the interval between those two times of day.<br /><br />What caused me to turn this movie off and voice my irratation was simply this: the Earnshaw residence. In this movie, the location of some of the most important and memorable moments of the book, the Earnshaw Manor House has been downgraded to little more than a shack that could barely pass for any sort of stables in that time to the unknowing eye.

She proved time and again how very capable she was, in providing for the family as her husband wasn't able to, so she could have taken her children and left that environment.

The two leads are outstanding actors, and they bring depth to the relationship at the core of the story. The changes made from the book are actually helpful clarifications. For example, Frank's character is not simply dropped after Claire crosses over, but we check back in with him in the present day.

Sure, it wasn't Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagine, all the same though, it was entertaining, and for a movie starring colossal CGI walking talking turtles jumping around subduing foot clan cronies with style, I can't fault it on that level. However, the acting was a bit poor, and some scenes were a little cheesy. It was still fun though. Maybe not as good as let's say the original TMNT movie, the 2003 series, the animated feature that came out 8 years ago in 2007, or even the current animated cgi series on nickelodeon, although that is admittedly not a movie; it's a TV show that I would like to persuade everyone, fan or not, to check out (again, it's on nickelodeon, so give it a try).  Some high points, the voices were top notch for the turtles, and they had plenty of personality, which is almost mandatory for a turtles film or series. I also appreciate that one of the main themes was &#34;family,&#34; because that is always that basis of a good turtle story. Shredder was also, in my opinion, quite intimidating in this movie, and a worthy interpretation of the character just by on-screen presence alone. The complicated and sometimes complex backstory of Shredder's past with master Splinter was scrapped for the sake of time, and it was obvious for anyone versed in turtles lore, and that may piss some fans off, but the intense action scenes, humor and charm made up for a lack of interesting backstory and character development. One thing this film nailed down was how Splinter raised the turtles as sons, and the dynamic I appreciated the most and its inclusion towards the all important main theme: family, which helped the film escape being a total time waster. I also like the little rap song during the credits near the end, and it reminds me of the current intro for the ongoing turtles animated series on nickelodeon (Seriously, what are you still doing here? Go watch it.)  If you've watchedthe very original cartoon from the 80's, the movies from the 90's, even the notoriously slammed Saban's Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, the animated series from 2003, the animated movie from 2007, the current series on nickelodeon that aired in 2012 -- the year the world was supposed to end, and finally this movie, then I would highly recommend IDW's current slate of TMNT comics by tom waltz, and as of now, it is currently 11 volumes in -- the 12th will be released on October 22nd. If you call yourself a turtles fan, then get off your tush and check it out. Yeah I know most people hate reading, but, you know, it's worth the time; it's worth YOUR time.  So, all in all, I think  this film stands on its own. It's not your typical turtles film, it's something different, so that may be why so many people hate it. 4 stars.  Pros: - Prevalent family theme - Charming turtles  Negatives: - No inclusion of the long storied relationship/history between Shredder and Splinter - Flat acting, although Vernon (Will Arnett) was okay.

This drama is the stuff of real life. The writers have created characters, dialogue and dramatic arcs that are just like people--  full of contradictions. Second, the actors are amazing. They inhabit their characters, they understand what drives them, and they take risks, letting us see their beauty and pain and love and courage and talent, so we believe them. The chemistry between them is powerful. Third, the music isn't just seamlessly woven into the story, it advances the story, moves the drama forward. Unlike the dorky musicals of yesteryear, where every time actors burst into song the story stalled, here the music is a living, breathing part of the story. And it's phenomenally good, original music, thanks to producer Timbaland, the amazing performances by &#34;Jamal&#34; and &#34;Hakeem,&#34; and the A list of Hip Hop stars who do cameo performances. This white girl wants to buy the album that comes out of this show!

As a Christian who grew up in India surrounded by many friends of strong faith in non-Christian traditions, and then (as an adult in the U.S.) attending a Jesuit university which had mandatory theology courses, I have had an exposure to religious discussion at its best and at its most ignorant all through my life. This seemed like it might be good when I read the premise, but the film makes several mistakes which I find unforgivable in this day and age.<br /><br />One thing I found galling was the portrayal of Muslim faith. There was so much they could have done to make Ayisha's conversion meaningful with some real examination of the different beliefs between the two religions. Instead they focused on the Hijab, and pretended that &quot;traditional&quot; Muslim faith is violent and that any exploration of Christian beliefs will cause a parent to disown his child and throw her into the street. I grew up in an apartment complex that housed Christian, Muslim and Hindu families. My friends and I spent holidays in each others homes, learning traditions and sharing stories of our own religions. One of my friends had a Christian mother and a Hindu father, which is even stranger than a Muslim-Christian marriage. At least Islam and Christianity share the same origins and belief in one God, with Islam even considering Jesus a prophet born of the virgin Mary. If the movie had focused on how Ayisha had come to believe that Jesus was divine, and not just one of the great prophets, it would have made for a far more convincing and powerful movie. Strike one.<br /><br />The movie spent some time following Josh and his girlfriend being lovey-dovey and cute as they walked through campus, and that raised a red flag in my brain. Sure enough, when the conflict arose, she was painted as a villain and the feminist in me retched. My girlfriend and I started dating in youth group when we were in high school and had she been watching this with me, I'm pretty sure she'd have kicked a hole in the T.V. In real life, I have never met a Christian couple (or even a couple with one Christian) that had such a poor dynamic. Most couples I've met are extremely supportive of each others decisions and struggles. The fact that this film chose to make the girlfriend an antagonist, and that she would end the relationship when his choice threatened her idea of what their hypothetical future should be... it was unrealistic. As with Ayisha's story, there were so many other choices in how to portray the story that would have been so much better. Strike two.<br /><br />My third criticism was Professor Radisson's reasons for antagonizing believers. It was a cliche among cliches. It was the farcical A-Few-Good-Men style showdown in the classroom between Wheaton and Radisson that made me give up on any hope of a redeeming factor that would allow me to give this movie anything but the lowest rating. I was an atheist for a while too before I learned to see God's work in people's lives. I understand why people can attribute everything to science and believe in their heart that there is no God. If Radisson's belief was simply intellectual I would have had far more respect for this movie, but the screenwriter just had to destroy it by making him sound like an angsty teenager blaming God for all his problems. I paused the movie for a day when I got to that point because I couldn't bear to watch it any longer, and I finished it only to write this review. I wish I hadn't. The two key moments of the last 27 minutes were the class's unanimous agreement that God is not dead (even in Theology class at a Jesuit university, it would be impossible to get that response, and my professors were considerably more convincing than Wheaton) and Radisson's death scene. Believe in Christ kids, or you'll get hit by a car! Blech.<br /><br />In reading other reviews, I get the impression that many of this movie's critics are Christians, and most of its supporters are Christian too. I feel like that says something about the failings of this movie; something truly powerful would draw a more diverse crowd and better discussion. I turned back to Christianity only after learning more about my Grandfather's life, and I feel like any single chapter from the book he wrote would make a more convincing case for Christianity than the entirety of this movie. I wish there were movies that portrayed faith more intelligently.br />In reading other reviews, I get the impression that many of this movie's critics are Christians, and most of its supporters are Christian too.

So it was produced, as the title says, to introduce the Mormon people to the world.   It is not a typical documentary. It's PR from the Mormon perspective. Nothing wrong with that per se, I think, but you should know what the purpose of the movie is. This movie does not go deeply into Mormon doctrines or current media &#34;controversies.&#34; It tries to show how Mormons live and how the church influences their lives.  The church is obviously trying to counter common misconceptions and/or ignorance about the church. Common misconceptions are that Mormons are, for example: weird cult-people, white young men in white shirts and ties on bicycles, from Utah, similar to the Amish, polygamists, bigots, un-Christian. This video goes out of its way to counter many of those myths and stereotypes.  As a Mormon I found it good viewing. I enjoyed the colorful locales and the positive messages. It was nice to see something that focused on the many positive aspects of my religion, which is rare in the media.  However, I found the young woman narrating to be rather annoying (she's a Mormon comedian). Perky to a fault, with a rather cringe-inducing script. Luckily, you don't see her much after the beginning.  I also wish they had included at least one typical Mormon. All the examples in the film seemed put there to counter stereotypes. Now there isn't really a typical Mormon, if you consider that most Mormons live outside the US, and over half are Spanish speaking. But as an American Mormon who grew up mostly outside Utah/Idaho I didn't see any examples of Mormons I've known, who are mostly middle class, educated, with professional careers. The guy at the end who was missing a leg was the closest, but also unusual in many ways. So in that sense the movie was a little misleading, as an introduction to the Mormons.  Overall, if you want an introduction to the Mormon people, I recommend thismovie. It shows the diversity of people in the church. It does an especially good job at showing how devout Mormons feel about their religion, what it means to them. Yes, we are largely an optimistic people who try to live good lives.  If you want to learn more about the doctrines and history of the Mormon church, wikipedia is a pretty good place to start. Next, if you want to understand what Mormons believe, I would recommend reading the Book of Mormon, including the explanatory material at the beginning. Mormons believe the book is ancient scripture, a companion to the Holy Bible. It's the &#34;keystone&#34; of our religion, as we Mormons say. It's pretty readable, like a history story with some sermons thrown in.  In a nutshell, this is how I would describe what Mormons believe:  Mormons believe in Jesus Christ and the Bible. They believe Jesus set up his church when he was alive. This church was lost over time. In 1830 God re-established the original church of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith in upper-state New York. This church is led by a prophet and 12 apostles. The purpose of this life is to grow and learn. It's also a test to show God that we will live by the teachings of Jesus. To live with God after this life we must be clean. Jesus died and paid the price of our sins if we will repent. If we do not repent we will eventually pay the full price ourselves. God loves us today as much as he loved ancient people. People can receive direction and comfort from God through the Holy Spirit. God also gives knowledge through the modern prophets. Mormons have three new books of scripture, which they value as highly as the Bible.  I would recommend you take negative things you hear about Mormons with a grain of salt. There are a lot of misconceptions and inaccuracies out there. Mormonism does contain things are easy to misconstrue, and opponents of the church are happy to do just that.",2015-08-23,1.0,True,1

I've become a champion of the book because it is magical, it has changed my life.  I've been earnestly working on decluttering for decades now and made great strides on my own and with some help. But my anxiety levels at having someone in to help me and when I've been alone dealing with really hard stuff like possessions from my childhood or my son's stuff or gifts from my deceased grandparents or the huge volume of clothes...jeez, it's so awful. Truly scary.  I happened upon Marie Kondo's book:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1607747308 The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing]]<br /><br />and read the whole thing in one gulp. Yes!!! That's what I've been searching for!!! The method that gives me a nuts 'n' bolts way to achieve my goal of a home that's clear and beautiful and functional.  We have the stuff we honestly need like appliances and furniture, food and clothes. But we also have overrun piles of stuff in every corner of the house.  For years I thought if I could just find the right storage/organizing system, I could keep everything, keep it tidy and out of the way and keep using it as I wanted.  Well...after changing out all my cardboard boxes for clear plastic bins and drawers...and trying to wrangle everything down...my house was still a huge mess.  I can work like a dog till I'm exhausted for days at a time and then when I collapse in a chair, I looked around and wanted to cry: it's still way too messy.<br /><br />So here comes this little Japanese girl (not a put-down...she's just so young and cute...and you'll see in the video from April 28, 2015 that she's married and expecting)  who writes a book that makes my heart sing.  She also foundered for years trying to get her stuff under control.  She started this venture at age 5. At 15 she was such a \\""crazy tidying fanatic\\""--her words--that she fainted during one maniacal episode. She began to study this huge problem in earnest and wrote her college thesis about it.<br /><br />Her two main points are you have to do it all at once within a few months instead of taking years and years and you have to see if each item in your home sparks joy.  You go by your heart and not your head: this item that you've always had and you thought you'd have forever...if you pick it up and it doesn't make you happy--let it go.  Even a pile of pretty Christmas cards from your family.  Even those fun jeans from college. Even gifts from your spouse. If it doesn't make you happy, let it go ... and without angst. The philosophy is to focus completely on what joyous things to keep instead of what unhappy things you're getting rid of. It's all about gaining more happiness through less stuff.  I threw away 90% of my son's childish scrawlings and now I enjoy the 8 or 10 instead of having the huge pile stuffed in a drawer. I'm happy every time I open my closet and see every stitch of clothes hung up nicely and the clear floor and the back wall.  I love that I have excess storage space in closets and drawers because they're not overstuffed.

Then they would sell the movie to audiences based on the star appeal rather than the content of the film. Most of this genre stunk something awful. (I'm looking at you, New Year's Eve) But Love Actually really delivers. It's an anomaly.<br /><br />It is still a bunch of actors crammed into small roles with a loosely connected story line.<br /><br />But the theme of each mini story is the same, that love is strong and takes on many different forms. You can love your wife, love your best friend, love your family, love a girlfriend, love someone you cant' have, love someone you can have, love your kids, love your country, etc etc etc. Some love is easy and fun (The Prime Minister and his girlfriend) some love is hard (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's marriage) and some love is down right painful (Laura Linney caring for a mentally ill brother).<br /><br />Each story comes back to that theme in the end, that no matter what else is going on in life and no matter how bad the world seems, there is love all around us. It's everywhere, and it's not hard to find. All you have to do is open your eyes to look for it.<br /><br />However, count me on the side of people who think that Andrew Lincoln's character was WAY out of line to go to Keira Nightly's house shortly after she's married to Lincoln's best friend to profess his undying love for her. That's not sweet. That's not cool, man. That's some low down home wrecking stuff there. People are split 50/50 on this scene. Some people think it's really sweet. But the truth is that he's unburdening his soul at the risk of damaging his best friend's marriage. That's not good. That's selfish.",2015-08-31,0.6666666666666666,False,1

It's over-the-top in all kinds of bad ways, with &#34;wacky&#34; record scratch noises, stupid voice-overs, and awful cartoon animations dropping in. Every sixty seconds or so there's another forced whimsical interlude. This show is tooth-achingly awful. It's not amusing; it's the result of a room full of clueless, middle-aged men sticking cat memes in a television show because that's what all the kids find funny these days, right? Painfully out-of-touch references (&#34;somebody get this kid on Dancing With the Stars already!&#34; is hooted towards a young boy eagerly flapping his arms to music) abound.<br /><br />This show is what you get when stodgy executive producers try to insert wacky humor into things. It's painful, it's embarrassing, and I can't sit through an episode without cringing. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised; it is essentially paying for an hour-long commercial. These restaurants profiled get the most tepid mainstream &#34;zany&#34; commentary while convincing you to go there. Nothing substantive is said. You won't even learn anything.<br /><br />By now, the foodie audience knows fairly well what goes on in a restaurant kitchen. Thanks to shows like Top Chef, Kitchen Nightmares (UK), and Restaurant Impossible, we're aware of how dangerous and weird the industry can be. Similarly, media such as Heat (an _excellent_ book) and Anthony Bourdain's numerous offerings show us the lengths people will go to for the pursuit of food. Even - yes, here I go - even GUY FIERI has a more compelling show than this. The man loves to eat, and he is honest in his love of stupid schlock. His own Food show (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives) is more interesting because he goes to these places, he eats at these places, and he shows us how a thing is cooked at<br />these places. I'm no fan of Guy, and I would rate his show above this. The point, however, stands: Food - the sourcing, preparation, and service thereof - is being demystified. This show assumes you still wonder where the soft bread has gone after the toast pops out.<br /><br />It's a shame how bad this is. It could be an interesting show if they would make it a behind-the-scenes look at different restaurant concepts.<br /><br />How does one decide to become a theme restaurant? What training do the dancing waitresses at Teatro Zinzani need to undergo? As a manager, how do I hire a chef who is also a ninja? What insurance nightmares have these places dealt with? How does a dinner theatre balance tasty food with intriguing performance? Are the singing cowboy bartenders considered performers, and do they make tips?<br /><br />None of the interesting questions are even hinted at in this messy extended commercial.

A cross between the Robin Hood legend and Johnson MacCauley's popular Zorro stories.  This time the hero is Escobar, the son of a wealthy Californiano, who meets out justice against an Americano land grabber named Barsto (referred in one place as BarStool).  First seen as a boy of 10 showing off his skills with a knife and lariat in the happy Mexian  province of California, he returns ten years later (although seemingly aged 30).  He discovers Barsto is in league with the tax collector and marshall to run all the 'Californios' off their property.  He has a faithful servant and speedy horse but<br />although said to wear a mask, always wears his unruffled hacienda suit.<br />The 'B' production company worked on the cheap, the various bandit hide out scenes are all of the same location, but the Haciendas are of the Spanish mission style, rarely noted in the 'A' production movies.  Two songs are included, sung in Spanish.<br />I've always found it dumb for film producers to have all major dialogue in English, then have guards speak or songs sung in the language that is suppose to be of the surrounding countryside.<br />Ricardo Cortez does an excellant job with the script although his lariat moves, generally shown in closeup, are rather mediocre.  He gives the best line in the movie.  Between Barsto and Ruiz the bandit and bringing  justice to the land, letting Ruiz's girlfriend try to seduce him he &#34;is just too busy.&#34;<br />For a saturday afternoon movie this is good.",2015-08-22,1.0,True,1

Oh, and the Holocaust is never mentioned or implied. Rather, the Germans are presented as victims of foreign invaders.  Also, imagine the film was released on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Final Solution.  Now set the film in 1919 Turkey instead, exchange the Germans for Turks, and you have the plot to Russell Crowe's The Water Diviner - released on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Armenian Genocide.  From what I have read, Crowe was adamant that he be able to film in Turkey, where they have banned any mention of the Armenian or Greek Genocides. What if Germany had such a law regarding the Holocaust, and an American filmmaker chose to agree to their terms in order to make a film about WWII? What would you think of such a person?

So, I'm rating the movie at a Pretty Good, highly enjoyable 4 stars out of 5 (I'd actually like to rate it at 3-1/2 stars, but fractions aren't allowed).<br /><br />Aside:  It's interesting to compare the &#34;use more of our brain&#34; theme here with how James Alan Gardner treats it in his [[ASIN:B00J90CHKS Ascending (League of Peoples Book 5)]] (that's the 5th book in his &#34;League of Peoples&#34; series which starts here:  [[ASIN:B00J90F354 Expendable (League of Peoples Book 1)]]) book.  In this movie, using all the interconnections in our brain makes a smarter, more intelligent, godlike being.  In Gardner's book, the fact that those interconnections didn't get pruned or deactivated as the brain matured makes a smarter being incapable of focusing.  Just from a neural net standpont, I tend to agree with Gardner.  It's an interesting comparison.",2015-08-23,1.0,True,1

They do this by introducing it late into a series after you have watched a few and decided you like it, counting on the hope that you will not exercise  self denial or self control and will give in instead of objecting and rejecting it strongly.

That potential is never realized. From the first few minutes of the film it's obvious that this is a no-budget passion project staffed and cast almost entirely by friends and family of the filmmakers, and the lack of experience is evident at every level. The camerawork is extremely messy, with poorly framed, static shots that go one for minutes at a time and a seeming inability to properly focus. The acting emphasizes every failing of the awful script, and the film's villain (played by writer and co-director Kristian Hanson) is a groan-inducing attempt at a Freddy Krueger archetype whose one-liners make for painfully bad cinema. Even the gore effects, which have been spoken of positively by some reviews, consisted almost entirely of people throwing blood onto things (the killer, a tree, the ground) from just off camera.<br /><br />Even devoted fans of the genre should avoid this one. It fails to even begin to approach the films it emulates, but it's more than just that. Sledge feels less like an amateur horror movie than a failing-grade film school project.

It begins with a session by the &#34;Little Giant” of the tenor saxophone, Johnny Griffin, and his quartet. This is followed by a performance by the Richie Cole Quintet on a separate date. The Vanguard has been one of the most famous jazz clubs in the world in terms of its history, the many performances there by the ‘best of the best’ in jazz, and the treasured live recordings. This reviewer has been there on many Saturday nights, Sunday afternoons, and Monday nights over 3 decades.  The Cole quintet appearance appears to be on a Sunday afternoon from Cole’s comments.<br /><br />The Griffin quartet includes the resourceful Kenny Washington on drums, Ray Drummond’s solid contrabass work, and the remarkable Ronnie Mathews on piano (mistakenly identified in ‘closed captioning’ as “Lonnie”). The video begins in the middle of a blazing uptempo Mathews piano solo, as the film shows exterior street scenes and the prominent awning over the entrance to this famous basement jazz club. The song is a blazing uptempo tribute to Babs Gonzalez, “Blues for Gonzie”, that gives way to Griffin’s inventive and humorous solo which is loaded with ‘quotes’ from “Dixie” to “Rhapsody in Blue”, showing his circular breathing prowess in the process, and ending with a furious sax-drum exchange. “A Monk’s Dream” has a marvelous solo piano intro by Mathews and a powerful solo from Griffin that includes a “Swinging on a Star” quote, with the entire performance receiving a loud ovation from the audience.<br /><br />Cole’s quintet includes the “Wild Man” Bobby Enriquez on piano, the superbBruce Forman on guitar, Marshall Hawkins on double bass, and Scott Morris on drums. The session begins with a supercharged version of Randy Weston’s jazz classic “High Fi” presented as a mambo and featuring great solos, then Cole salutes club owner Max Gordon with the standard ballad “I’ll Can’t Get Started” with a great “Oh, You Beautiful Girl” quote. The humorous “The Punishment Blues”, dedicated to &#34;criminals and creeps&#34;, is laced with cymbal splashes, booming bass, and a raunchy Cole solo, with great altissimo alto sax effects, got a standing ovation. “Yardbird Suite” gets a rousing performance with Enriquez' dazzling single lines, occasionally playing &#34;col pugno” with his fists, palms, and elbows while making perfect muscial sense, and a sizzling solo from guitar master Forman. Live jazz from an historic club by 2 masters of the art. My Highest Recommendation. Five FIERY Stars!

The movie never allows you to feel compassion for Sam Ellis, so when he gets into trouble, you are just watching a guy go through the motions. This appears to be some sort of behind the scenes of our real politicians film that didn't seem to drive it home.<br /><br /> Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Lena Headey, Alexandra Breckenridge, Penelope Mitchell, Jessica Pike)",2015-08-29,1.0,True,0

However, this film, like many that have come before, is overly fanatical and enthusiastic about the potential of technology to revolutionize society. The truth is, powerful institutions, while not always, are often able to exploit new technologies as they develop and are able to maintain their dominance. Government, being the most dominant of institutions, is unlikely to lose its grasp on society. In fact, since this film came out (2008?) we have seen governments, political parties, large media corporations, and other governing institutions effectively adapt their practices around new IT technologies, and use such technologies to actually enhance their control. Specifically, I think about the fact that modern political campaigns are able to target voters better now than ever before, or the fact that social media actually has increased mainstream (aka CNN) media website traffic, or the fact that the NSA is able to now track a significant amount of behavior through internet surveillance. At the end of the day, the reason powerful institutions are powerful is because such institutions will always exploit technology to increase their power, and, unless the internet can magically counteract that objective we are unlikely to see government significantly affected.",2015-08-27,0.8333333333333334,True,0

They are married, but not to each other.  They have never met before this chance encounter.  With that said, here it goes.  These two meet outside their adjoining motel rooms while she's smoking a cig and he can't sleep due to the parking lot light streaming through his motel room window.  The story begins to drag quickly as the script is not believable, the actors have no chemistry [turns out they (the actors, not the characters) really ARE married] and the characters fail to show what is so interesting about themselves that the other wants to continue their parking-lot conversation beyond a few minutes.  The entire movie takes place in less than 24 hours, so it's initially unbelievable that two, married strangers would not only talk for hours but also share a meal at the diner (within 10 minutes of meeting each other) and go for a motorcycle ride (which was carelessly lent to them by the motel manager).  It is also unbelievable that no matter how heated their arguments get or how many times she bitches at or insults him, neither of them walks back to their room to get some much needed sleep.  And, unless she is mentally ill, it is not possible in that span of time for her to get so attached to him that she gets jealous and depressed whenever he talks about his wife.  Beyond the poor script and uninteresting characters, his acting is weak. (I was surprised to read that he is an award-winning actor in Chicago.)  Now I admit I have never seen any of his previous work, so I have nothing to compare this to, but I thought he over-acted, which led to him creating a character who seemed more of a dork than a dreamboat.  I would have expected SOME interest from her if his character was at least as emotionally attractive as he is physically, but he really has nothing to offer.  Her acting was good but her moody character got annoying quickly.    You're left wondering, &#34;Why was this film made and why did I just waste 90 minutes of my life watching it?&#34;",2015-08-26,0.6666666666666666,False,0

The solid acting, cinematography, gore, and slight social commentary perfectly fit this simple yet compelling story of bullying and social ostracization. There is not a moment of fat in the film, and we couldn’t take our eyes from it. As this is a fairly gory pic involving violence to (and at the hands of) young kids (and animals), some viewers may shirk, considering the concept taboo. But that’s one of horror’s many opportunities: to show us in graphic detail what we know happens in the world but which we refuse to speak of aloud.

The performances were very good. Viggo (Chester) is always great. The plot is basically an innocent outsider (Rydal) gets sucked into a con man's problems, wants to rescue the con man's wife (Colette, portrayed by Kirstan Dunst), and it all goes downhill from there. Of the three characters, I thought Colette was the weakest - I wasn't quite sure if she knew how her husband got the money and what kind of man he was, since she seems surprised when a private detective shows up on their hotel doorstep. There was a nice narrative arc with Rydal's unhappy backstory with his father, which is reflected in and resolved through his relationship with Chester. Ultimately, I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting in their own right, but together, they made for a decent drama. Good rental for a slow night, especially if you enjoy Viggo Mortensen's acting. As others have pointed out, the lovely Greek setting was also a plus.

Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />The show seems very well made.  It looked like an A-list movie.  I recorded the HD version.  Looked great.  The show is all about those who were around when the virus first started.  The acting was good.<br /><br />That is really it.  Now, All of that seemed fine.  You’re wondering why I gave it a 3 out of 5?  Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Ok, they had a lot happening all at once.  You learned there was a family whose mom was remarried or dating a man.<br /><br />The kids did not really care for the man.<br /><br />The man and woman were teachers.<br /><br />The son was a drug addict and hung around bad people.<br /><br />The daughter was smart and good in school, but seems to have lost interest.<br /><br />The daughter has a boyfriend who she loves.<br /><br />The son’s friend, who the parents think is good, really is not.<br /><br />The sister cares about the brother.<br /><br />The mom is wondering if it is worth going after her son.<br /><br />Ok, you’re thinking to yourself “that is a story.”<br /><br />Well, that is true.  But, the reason I wonder if I will be able to get into this is for the fact that I already know their fates.  They will all be dead.  The drug addict, the parents, the intelligent girl, all of their friends and family, gone.  So, why do I care at all about their personal stories?  The problem is, I can’t see myself ever really being able to.<br /><br />I thought this show would start out slow and eventually have the virus and the zombies.  But, the first episode it started.  If this is a show with zombies, is it not The Walking Dead?<br /><br />If this has millions of people, finding out about the virus and not knowing what to do, than that leaves you with a show about panic and chaos.  The Walking Dead is about survival.  I do not think the two are the same at all.  Chaos is uncontrolled insanity.  It is groups of people running around in fear, not knowing what to do.  Unintelligently, unintentionally killing, stealing and hurting themselves.  Survival is doing everything you can to survive.  No matter what it is.  You may not know everything that is happening or how to stop it.  But you make yourself a list of rules.  You live by those few rules.  That makes a kind of law.  The two seem different to me.  Do I really want to watch chaos?  I really am not sure that I do.<br /><br />Also, they do this odd thing when the kid is running.  Like they slow it down.  It just seemed stupid to me.  It made me remember that I was watching a TV show and drew my mind from the story.<br /><br />Update:<br />So, I watched the second episode last night.  My god this show is boring.  I swear, they keep showing the same scene of the panicking public.  Oh, we get it, panic.  Now why not add some story to the thing?  Back and forth from one group to the next.  I would find this much better if it were just that family.  I mean, they are adding so much to try and make this interesting.  But, it is not.  I just don't understand it.

I expected something different from the title.  It was full of emotion, with a big letdown of a twist at the end.  At the end I felt tricked, the same way that I felt after watching &#34;The Sixth Sense.&#34;  S P O I L E R S  . . . . . .  The guy in this movie, Eric, is a real creep and a real loser.  I would have given this movie a dozen zeros. But I will give it one star for the sweet character of Rachel and the way that I could really feel all of her emotions. I could feel her broken heart and how she ached to feel better.  In an effort to cope with her husband's death from a plane crash, Rachel has been going to group meetings for people who are grieving the death of a loved one. She meets Eric there. But Eric has no business there.  Eric has also been isolating himself inside of his pain, for the loss of his girlfriend, and cannot find a way to move on. But, as we discover at the very end of the movie, his girlfriend never died. She simply left him, abruptly, and two months after she left, Eric discovered that she gave him an STD. He goes to a dermatologist to treat his STD, and, by coincidence, the dermatologist happens to be Rachel's father.  Of course, because of doctor-patient confidentiality, the dermatologist cannot tell his daughter that the guy that she has gotten interested in has an STD, but I really wanted the doctor to tell her, and to tell her that this guy is probably not a good choice for her.  Trying to deal with pain, Rachel deserved a decent nice guy, not someone who could continually lie in the face of her pain.  Eric actually had the nerve to ask Rachel, a grieving widow, two inappropriate questions: (1) Was your husband ever unfaithful to you? (2) Which was more painful for you, when you lost someone through a sudden death, or when you lost someone by a long dragged-out death? How could he be so insensitive and cruel as to pull more pain out of someone already suffering? Rachel dodged both questions with class.  Therewas one really heartbreaking scene, where Rachel goes to visit her father, and she just starts sobbing. Her father hugs her and tries to comfort her, and they talk about how the pain will never go away, but she will somehow find a way to feel better and go on.  It also touched me when Rachel took off her wedding ring, and a few hours later, put it back on again.  And it really touched me to see Rachel's bedroom, a room full of photos of her husband and a closet full of his clothes.  Eric pretended that his girlfriend was dead and attended meetings for people who are grieving deaths. Getting dumped by a girlfriend cannot compare to losing a spouse by a sudden death. Of course, it can be argued that it is still a loss and it is still painful, but there is absolutely no comparison. With a breakup, there is the possibility of being reunited, or of at least keeping contact with the person, and so there is still hope.  Eric, and the guys in the movie, never actually said that the girlfriend was dead, but the movie carefully and purposefully leads the viewer to absolutely think that.  When the therapist who was leading the meeting asked Eric who he lost, Eric should have said that he was grieving, but that his loved one did not die, and I am sure that everyone at the meeting would have still accepted him. There was no excuse for lying.  What was the point of Eric's foot fracture? It had no meaning for the movie.  I absolutely hated this movie, but I absolutely loved the ending. Rachel finds out, in a horrible way, that Eric's girlfriend is alive, by seeing her standing on a corner and recognizing her from her picture. Rachel showed real class by just walking away from Eric. The average woman in that situation would have screamed at him, cursed at him, slapped him, spit in his face.  Rachel actually went to visit him one more time after that, obviously to get some closure for herself, and she just smiled and wished him well and left, and the movie ends with her smiling, and I took that to mean that she is ready to try to move forward with her life.  I loved that Rachel and Eric did not end up together, because she deserved so much better than someone who could lie so easily and continually, and to be so selfish and self-absorbed that he could not feel other people's pain.  I loved the character of Rachel.  She was so sweet and open.  I loved the way that she threw a party for her friend when her friend became engaged, putting aside her own painful emotions to be genuinely happy for her friend's joy.  I cannot recommend this movie, especially to anyone who is grieving. Instead, I would recommend the movie &#34;Rabbit Hole&#34; with Nicole Kidman.",2015-08-26,0.6923076923076923,False,0

Charlize Theron deserves a special mention as Imperator Furiosa; this is easily the most intense role I've seen her in since &#34;Monster&#34; and shows that she really is a versatile actress.

Adam, a recovering sex addict, relapses and is about to have sex with a woman, Becky, whom he used to &#34;act out&#34; with. They get out of control, and Becky becomes hysterical. It becomes obvious that something was just triggered for her about past sexual abuse. She locks herself in the bathroom and overdoes on pills that she finds in Adam's medicine cabinet. That experience gets Adam back on track again.  There was another scene that touched me. Neil is a sex addict, lying to everyone in the group, by saying that he is doing well in recovery.  The truth is that he just got fired for acting out at work.  He  breaks down and opens up in group, and says, &#34;I'm out of control. I'm scared.

The acting in Zachariah is remarkable, which is of paramount importance in a character-driven film. A simple plot is suitable; there was no reason to go beyond the profound meanings of being the only people alive. The soundtrack is perfect, adding icing to an already tasty cake.<br /><br />Like The Quiet Earth (TQE), Zachariah is a &#34;last remaining boy meets last remaining girl&#34; story complicated by a &#34;wait, there's actually another boy too&#34; scenario. Although a cerebral movie, Z for Zachariah pushes a restrained but hardly unbroken tension for its duration. In ways, this existential uncertainty is as impactful as something like [[ASIN:B0049VZ2UY The Walking Dead]], with a different but no less potent sense of urgency since changes in group dynamics are greater in magnitude when fewer characters are alive. Both Z for Zachariah and Z for Zombies (The Walking Dead) bring up the finer points of &#34;cooperate or die,&#34; but in Zachariah the common enemy element is absent (no zombies to contend with, just avoid radiation and you're all set), so the focus is completely on how the human race might continue in an arbitrary tribe of 3.<br /><br />If you want closure, watch Air instead, or even TQE (come to think of it, watch TQE no matter what). If you simply want a thought-provoking 95 minutes with an earnest and engaging story, then give Z for Zachariah a chance.",2015-08-29,0.7142857142857143,False,1

I'm not a fan of superhero movies and I'd never heard of Chris Evans before watching this. (I managed that by being more of a reader than movie watcher, and not being exposed to TV or celeb gossip mags.)<br /><br />I fast forwarded through all the riduculous, mythological Hydra parts, once I got the picture. Ditto with the violence. Obviously, you're going to have violence in a superhero movie, but I didn't need it to enjoy this film. There was so much fun and interesting character development, particularly where the main character is concerned. I found myself liking Evans more than any actor I've seen in a long time. His portrayal is spot on, with the combination of innocence, passion and integrity that would have made a less natural and unself-conscious actor look comical...and not in a good way.<br /><br />I thought all the actors were wonderful (how can you go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones in a supporting role?), and the movie magic of turning Evans into a ninety pound weakling (I actually liked him better in that part; he played it so true) blew me away. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is I didn't like the violence or suggestion of occultism. Which of course is subjective and won't affect how others see this film.<br /><br />After watching this, I bought other movies with Evans in them (Cellular, Sunshine, Loss of a Teardrop Diamond) and came away wishing he'd do a remake of one of my favorite books (which has twice been made into a movie) Lost Horizon by James Hilton. The main character, although English, is in every other way described as being very like Chris Evans: &#34;There was something Elizabethan about him--his casual versatility, his good looks, that effervescent combination of mental with physical activities.&#34; &#34;He had a peculiar charm, a sort of winsomeness that's pleasant to remember...with a core of attractiveness to him.&#34; &#34;He's got a sort of way with him of dealing with people.&#34; &#34;He was tall...with brown short cropped hair and slate blue eyes. He was inclined to look severe or brooding until he laughed, then...he looked boyish.&#34;<br /><br />I really feel it's time someone remade the story of Shangri La for modern times... if only to wipe out the memory of the Michael Yorke musical version. And Chris Evans seems the perfect person to make it come alive. How about it, Mr. Evans?t a sort of way with him of dealing with people.&#34; &#34;He was tall...with brown short cropped hair and slate blue eyes.

Mitchell, British inventor of the 'Spitfire' airplane. Mitchell changed the course of British aircraft history. Those who had known Mitchell well described him as an adaptive genius, possessing excellent attention to detail, and was a great thinker. Mitchell passed away just after the 'Spitfire' was completed and put into action during World War II, but he and his plane will never be forgotten!<br /><br />R.J. Mitchell was born in Staffordshire, England. After leaving Hanley High School at the age of 16 he gained an apprenticeship at Kerr Stuart & Co. of Fenton, a locomotive engineering company. At the end of his apprenticeship he worked in the drawing office at Kerr Stuart and studied engineering and mathematics at night school.<br /><br />In 1917, he joined the Supermarine Aviation Works at Southampton. Advancing quickly within the company, Mitchell was appointed Chief Designer in 1919. He was made Chief Engineer in 1920 and Technical Director in 1927. He was so highly regarded that, when Vickers took over Supermarine in 1928, one of the conditions was that Mitchell stay as a designer for the next five years.<br /><br />Between 1920 and 1936, Mitchell designed 24 aircraft including light aircraft, fighters and bombers. As Supermarine was primarily a seaplane manufacturer, this included a number of flying boats such as the Supermarine Sea Eagle, the Supermarine Sea King, the Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Stranraer. However, Mitchell is best remembered for his work on a series of racing aircraft, which culminated in the Supermarine, and the famous Supermarine Spitfire fighter.<br /><br />In 1931 the Air Ministry issued specification F7/30 for a fighter aircraft to replace the Gloster Gauntlet. Mitchell's proposed design, the Type 224 was one of three designs for which the Air Ministry ordered prototypes.<br /><br />Mitchell was awarded the CBE in 1932 for his contribution to high-speed flight.<br /><br />The Supermarine Spitfire first flew on February 19, 1934, but was eventually rejected by the RAF because of its unsatisfactory performance. While the 224 was being built, Mitchell was authorized by Supermarine in 1933 to proceed with a new design, the Type 300, an all-metal monoplane that would become the Supermarine Spitfire. This was originally a private venture by Supermarine, but the RAF quickly became interested and the Air Ministry financed a prototype.<br /><br />The first prototype Spitfire, serial K5054, flew for the first time on March 5,1936 at Eastleigh, Hampshire. In later tests, it reached 349 mph, consequently, before the prototype had completed its official trials, the RAF ordered 310 production Spitfires. Mitchell is reported to have said that &#34;Spitfire was just the sort of bloody, silly name they would choose.&#34;<br /><br />In 1936 Mitchell was diagnosed with cancer, and subsequently, in early 1937, Mitchell gave up work, although he was often seen watching the Spitfire being tested. Mitchell went to the American Foundation in Vienna for a month, but died on June 11, 1937 at the age 42.<br /><br />Mitchell's design was so sound that the Spitfire was continually improved throughout the Second World War. Over 22,000 Spitfires and derivatives were built.<br /><br />At the end of his life, Mitchell was quoted as saying, &#34;If anybody ever tells you anything about an aeroplane which is so bloody complicated you can't understand it, take it from me: it's all balls.&#34;<br /><br />Watch this program.

Casanova, Louis XV, and Madame de Pompadour portrayed in Episode 1 are all people from the period whose deeds and in Casanova's case, his autobiography are available to the writers of the series. The period costumes, environments, and manners are satisfactorily represented.  The portrayal of the execution of the assassin of Louis XV mostly occurred as it was staged. The poor man was tied down, tortured, molten metal was poured into his wounds, and he was then drawn and quartered. In the film he was shown being pulled apart by horses, while the common people and members of the court, including Louis XV looked on.<br /><br />Historical drama and costume epics these days often degenerate into dull descriptions of power politics, overly dramatic and high highfalutin dialogue, naked women and orgies, and lots of bloody battles and murders. Think &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; - very overrated in my opinion - and the dreadful &#34;Tut&#34; both of which are tiresome and unoriginal.<br /><br />In the first installment of Casanova, the writers stayed true to the era and the people seemed real enough.

The film opens like a tongue-in-cheek parody—the cassette the characters are listening to is labeled “Killer Mix”; characters call the house they are about to enter a death trap, not realizing how right they are, another character is dismissed as being Clueless (which would actually be a 90’s reference)—all silly and mild stuff that is playful without being funny.<br /><br />Eventually Lost After Dark shifts gears completely and turns into a straight body count movie—but not one that resembles an actual 1980’s slasher pic.  Lost After Dark feels an awful lot like a third-rate Wrong Turn knock-off that somebody tried to dress-up with some superficial 1980’s elements.<br /><br />In the 1980’s slasher genre there were some pretty basic rules that were laid out explicitly in Scream.  Sex was linked with death and the characters who had sex suffered grisly, horrible murder—but in Lost After Dark there is no sex.  In a genuine 1980’s slasher pic the virginal girl is the one who survives when everyone else gets killed around her—which is not the case here even though there is an obvious candidate for the good girl part.  After Lost After Dark shifts gears it feels nothing whatsoever like a 1980’s slasher pic, features no memorable gore and no imaginative murders.  Without the sweet, virginal girl we know is supposed to survive Lost After Dark leaves the audience with nobody to root for—just a collection of interchangeable victims and a killer with zero personality who we rarely see.  There actually might be two murderers but the movie cares so little about the mythology surrounding the house and its murderous family it's hard to tell for sure.<br /><br />It would be nice if someone who is actually a fan of the 1980’s slasher genre made a homage instead of people who clearly have no understanding or knowledge of the genre.  Eli Roth's fake trailer for Thanksgiving from Grindhouse is probably the most perfect 1980's slasher homage I have ever seen--and if Machete hadn't been such a dud maybe the planned full-length version of Thanksgiving would have actually been made.  Lost After Dark, on the other hand,  would be lousy as a straight Wrong Turn type horror film but as a supposed homage to 1980’s slasher films it's a complete failure.",2015-08-23,0.65,False,0

It's a glimmering example of cinematic excellence, canonically resonant with films such as Gone With the Wind, American Psycho, Citizen Kane, and The Human Centipede. The film manages to defy expectation after expectation while fulfilling expectation after expectation. It's like nothing you've never seen before. Socially, the film chronicles a bunch of preteens whose bouts of childish grouse flood your neocortex and remind you how fortunate you are to live in the first world, where you are free to talk about boys and hair on the internet and unfriend creepy people at will...that is, until those creepy people end up confirming your worst suspicions of them and start murdering your friends. Brilliant! The only thing that would have made it more brilliant is if the creep was a member of ISIS! But that's just nitpicking. Clearly the filmmakers did not have time to create a fictitious social media profile of a Syrian extremist. I mean, where would they even start? &#34;My name is Achmesh and I like killing people.&#34; .... it would give the whole thing away before they even unfriend him! All in all, this film is a cautionary tale wrapped in a perfectly entertaining spotlight of the kids who you wanted to trip in middle school! The drama is Aristotelian, the narrative is as razor sharp as Un Chien Andalou, and the horror factor is bound to leave you up at night questioning why you still live in America.

Do I like it? I bought it twice, so yeah. After I walked by a table with a couple of guys selling their film, I was immediately captivated by the cinematography that was being shown on the 10 inch screen. This looked too well done for a project that didn't have a big studio behind it. Needless to say,  it was better than I thought.<br /><br />Dead Weight is a survivor movie more than a zombie film. With dark humor and a little romance, it surprised me with the connection I made with the characters which is in large part due to the writing and editing of the film. Unlike most post apocalyptic films, it is the journey of a group not only trying to survive starvation, the elements and other survivors but with a specific destination that keeps them going.  Specifically, Charlie who is going to make this destination no matter what in hopes of reuniting with his girlfriend Samantha.  With no confirmation that his girlfriend Samantha is even there, Charlie becomes obsessed and nothing will stop him. If you are an obstacle or defy the path, you're dead weight.<br /><br />Most horror stories focus on the monsters that are made by bug, bird or whatever outbreak the writers decide to develop. This film DOES have monsters and they are man made. The only difference is these monsters know how not to be monsters and still act less human than the things in the dark.<br /><br />John Pata and Adam Bartlett do a superb job of directing and writing with editing that is award worthy. I truly look forward to what these gentlemen will show us next. Joe Belknap does a fantastic job for a first time acting role.  Aaron Christensen, Michelle Courvais and Mary Lindberg give spectacular supporting performances as does the entire cast.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning,  this is a survivor movie.  Surviving the elements, surviving your fellow survivors, surviving exhaustion and ultimately yourself. I recommend DeadWeight as a superb horror drama.",2015-08-31,0.6666666666666666,False,1

On top of this they throw into the mix a strangely laconic group of ISIS members, who none-the-less dutifully get around to killing their share of the townspeople for singing and playing music.

Second, before going to see this movie at the theatre, I knew it had a low-budget compared to a regular Hollywood one, only 35 million dollars. However it turned out to be unexpectedly entertaining because of the factors listed below.  It contained some interesting dialogues and twists. For example, during an interrogation, the conversation went like this: Interrogator: “What’s your name?” Assassin: “Hitman 47.”  Interrogator: “That’s not a name.” Assassin: “No. But it’s my name.” And then, he did something spectacular that I did not foresee. It’s exciting!  In another scene, his conversation with a woman went like this: Assassin: “There are many armed men coming here.” She replied: “You’re wrong. There’s only one.” The next thing that happened caught me by surprise. It’s interesting.  The editing was effective. It made the action scenes intense, quick and deadly. I had no moment of boredom. The special effects were eye-catching. The acting was convincing. There’s some character development regarding father and daughter relationship and changing one’s life by not doing something.

I'm not sure why it is often described as a &#34;fantasy.&#34; It's not. It's an extremely atmospheric ghost story. Some of my favorite scenes from any of aforementioned classics are the fog-bound bogs from The Wolf Man. In Strangler of the Swamp we are treated to an eerie fog-shrouded swamp, creaky docks, dangling nooses, and dirt paths leading to who knows where, all photographed in that beautiful, flat, claustrophobic manner typical of well-devised interior filmmaking. The ghost is creepily presented, and an aura of dread pervades the story, which takes place almost entirely outside, at night in the swamp. This phrase is overused but I will say it: this film is a lost gem, sadly overlooked. For sure Strangler was not brilliantly conceived in the manner of something like The Bride of Frankenstein - it's not in the same league - it was after all a low budget quickie - but it is worth repeated viewing, so I do plan to purchase it because who knows when it might disappear from circulation since it has never risen to classic status.",2015-08-25,1.0,True,1

The cast members give earnest performances and the production values are good for a relatively low-budget film.  But the plot puts too much emphasis on unpleasant, poorly-developed personal relationships and too little on the film's special setting -- the very small &#34;world&#34; of the voice-over artists who work in the film, television, and advertising industries.  Thousands of movies depict the troubles between parents and children or between siblings.  Even more emphasize budding romances between co-workers.  IN A WORLD is among them.  But how many movies show us about how voice-overs and sound effects that are carefully and powerfully crafted into films, TV shows, and advertisements are made?  IN A WORLD is unique and special because it attempts to do this. Unfortunately and quite disappointingly, it quickly devolves into a conventional story of family and workplace relationships that we've all seen so many times before.  Its special opportunity to show us the world of voice-over work is buried by a bunch of father-daughter-sister-coworker relationship nonsense.  To add insult to injury, the relationships in this particularly movie themselves seem simplistic if not cartoonish.  Films such as THE PLAYER, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, and THIS IS SPINAL TAP prove that movies about the often unflattering inner workings of the entertainment industry while still having a interesting characters and a captivating, humorous story arc can be made.

Like Superman strong smell.  He can smell a girl on a horse miles away.  It's hard to fathom how you can tell this story without it being a bit over-the-top, cheesy, or silly at times.  Imagine a movie that features a man closing his eyes and sniffing with great gusto multiple times and you'll have this movie.<br /><br />At any given moment this movie looks like a cinematic dream.  The saturated colors, the camera angles, etc. Even big names like Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman help give the impression of a great movie.  However, this movie is none of these things.  It is an empty shell, much like the topic of the movie - overly bold attempts to create something real and meaningful from a long list of synthetic ingredients.<br /><br />The movie starts with a third person narration, which seems to set the stage for a kind of distant, off hand connection with the characters and indeed, the story itself.  The main character speaks few words  and is incapable of feeling much, which transfers into the audience.  A bulk of the rest of the characters are a blur of glorified extras with the exception of the old has-been perfume master, played by Dustin Hoffman and the paranoid father of the final victim, played by Alan Rickman.  Dustin Hoffman's character is the closest I was able to feel connection to, as he had a struggle of overcoming his failure to live up to his one time fame as a perfumist.  He has a desire, he has personality, and he has longing, ego, and all the other ingredients that make a human and their story interesting to see or hear.  The main character of this film has only longing, but we really aren't given any understanding of why.  He becomes obsessed with the smell of a girl and ultimately kills her while trying to capture her scent, but he quickly becomes enamored with another girls scent later in the movie (both red heads, apparently his nose has a thing for gingers).  Why isn't he just walking around digging these smells and all the other smells of other red head ladies?  What is it that compels him to want to save these smells? We never really know.<br /><br />Another issue with the story - if this man has such an intense sense of smell, which the movie pushes to the audience regularly showing him being able to smell on an almost atomic level, how could he ever be happy with any perfume he made?  Something that contains animal fats and alcohol, surely he would smell that mixed in with his essences and not be able to really call his replica enjoyable?  But I digress...<br /><br />This movie is 2 and a half hours long.  If you're going to have a story to tell that is that long, it better be an exciting and gripping one.  Perfume comes across more as a semi OK story that just really REALLY took its time getting to the point.  Slow and rambling comes to mind.  Which is hard enough to handle in general, but when you don't really care about the characters or their motives, it becomes really tedious very quickly.<br /><br />The ending is hollow and takes fooorrreeeever to wrap up.<br /><br />I would ultimately compare watching this movie to sex that could have been mediocre if it hadn't dragged on so long, but because the other party was sooooo sure everything they were doing was beautiful and meaningful, it dragged the sex down to barely tolerable and with a grand finale that left you exhausted and bored, yet unsatisfied.or gingers).

People were returning them to the stores saying they were malfunctioning because they were &#34;pegged&#34; when pointed at electric stovetop burners, hair dryers, and out the window onto the street. Fact is, they were working perfectly. All of those items emit microwave energy that is hundreds to millions of times what a microwave oven does.<br /><br />Your handheld hair dryer emits more than 1,000,000 times the microwave radiation of your smart meter; and you hold it pointed directly at your head for several minutes every morning after you get out of your shower.<br /><br />And the biggest microwave radiation emitter on the face of the earth (literally, on the face of the earth) is the asphalt road that runs in front of your home.<br /><br />When you see the &#34;heat wave&#34; rising from the street in front of your house on a summer day, that heat wave is 100% microwave radiation at an intensity that heats your entire body from the inside out. Can your &#34;smart&#34; electric meter do that?.<br /><br />Those are the scientific facts. No discussion, no proof, no argument. That ship has already sailed, those trains have already left the station. Those are the facts. All you have to do to verify these facts are go to your local High School and ask the Physics teacher to show you the chart she/he has on the wall of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. Then ask him/her to explain to you something thermodynamics people call, &#34;Black Body Radiation&#34;.<br /><br />That black asphalt in front of your house is being heated by the sun and photons are being absorbed and &#34;re-emitted&#34; from the asphalt. That high school physics teacher will tell you that is &#34;black body radiation&#34;. He/she will also tell you all of it is in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We are talking MILLIONS of watts of radiated microwave power. The person who wrote, directed, produced this &#34;documentary&#34; knows none of these facts.<br /><br />The writer, producer, director is trying to convince you that millionths of a watt (microwatts) from a Smart Power Meter is killing you, while he forgets to mention the megawatts of microwave energy you are exposed to crossing a black asphalt street on a sunny summer day.<br /><br />This movie is fear mongering of the most despicable kind.<br /><br />I have a &#34;smart meter&#34; on my house. I have &#34;smart meters&#34; on my rental property houses. Nobody in any neighborhood I own property in has had a house burn down. Nobody; from any cause. Period.  His &#34;proof&#34; that &#34;smart meters&#34; cause house fires is an anecdotal report from a phone call that wasn't recorded to a person who isn't named. His interview of a person whose &#34;house&#34; (?) burned down was an interview of someone whose &#34;house&#34; was in such poor / substandard condition that there is a greater likelihood that the owner set fire to that structure in order to collect the insurance money.

They were non-denominational safe houses for prostitutes and homeless women.  Later, in the mid-nineteenth century the Church, in a  alliance with the State, took them over.  The goals were to continue providing services to “lost women,” cover the costs through the work regime, and provide a social service to the State. In this arrangement, nuns, the lowest members of the Church hierarchy, served as the front line workers, and were no more party to the shaping of the institution, and its expanded client list, than were the rescued women they served.<br /><br />So, there were three forces behind the Catholic Magdalene houses:  the prostitute users and rapists who created the inmates, the State which hid both sexual license and its victims, and the Church which gained communal and moral sway.<br /><br />“The Magdalene Sisters” snuffs this broader context, choosing to see the oppression and suffering through the reductive lens of personal sexual repression.  The nuns are not viewed in any sense as co-victims or sisters to their charges but as authoritarian, sadistic old maids.  Though they work from dawn until dusk with house, factory, and prayer work, their lives are viewed as hypertrophied.  Even in their only human moment during the communal viewing of “The Bells of St. Mary,” they quickly revert to their stepmother harshness.  That sexual repression owns their actions, determines their person is specifically underscored in the villainous stripping game they force on the inmates, as if they were male screws in a women’s prison.<br /><br />If one had to choose the dominant symbols of sexual repression in western culture today, nuns, priests, women, and Catholic Ireland would no doubt first come to mind.  “The Magdalene Sisters” pushes all these buttons--and sparks the film with some sexual scenes and sexual fun and games to boot.<br /><br />The sex abusive priest exists in the same mold as the young rapist at the Catholic-ridden music event. Their acts are not so much the problem as is their sexual repression born of a puritanical Irish Catholicism. What the priest suffers for his act is a prank which divests him of layers of hypocritical clothing.  The laughable strip tease is no doubt more popular and desirable to a modern audience than some “politically correct” form of public justice. But the exculpation of criminal acts is still in place, as it is in the case of that same violent rapist lad--to whom nothing at all happens.<br /><br />Anyway, when the girls enter the gate, we’re supposed to believe that their persecution begins right then.  The world they have left behind (run by and for men) goes scot free, but the world they enter, a women’s world, is a prison.  The Sisters of Mercy are the torturers.  And Mother Superior is the unbending warden, while nuns young and old, having suppressed all kindness,  understanding and intelligence, are the merciless screws. Their incarceration techniques are are so effective that the State has washed its hands of its supervisory role.<br /><br />The social context is replaced by the private narrative. The political is psychologized. Women are pitted against women.  Freud’s myth of sexual repression, so powerfully adhered to in  Hollywoodland, displace sexual license, and the State’s/Church’s central role in protecting it.<br /><br />In sum, Christ, a man, can understand Mary Magdalene; the Sisters of Mercy,  working in the Magdalene homes, and all women, cannot.  Because they are the scapegoat.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,0

He and his wife are devastated when the sons are apparently reported as dead by the army. His wife despairs so greatly that she kills herself, but her last wish is for her husband (Crowe) to go to Turkey and confirm that they are dead, and to bring their bodies home. Thus begins a great trip to Turkey for Joshua Connor (Crowe).  What do I say here? This is Russell Crowe's directing debut, and he does a solidly good job. There is nothing here to vehemently complain about, but honestly, this movie doesn't nail it out of the park either. I think I would give it 2.5 stars were that possible, but since amazon only lets you vote in whole stars, I'll give it 3 (2 seems too low).  Russell Crowe in my opinion takes a pretty big page from Steven Spielberg's playbook for this movie; this movie seemed to me to be a slightly lesser version of a Spielberg film. That is not to give discouraging words to Crowe, I think he should stick with it; this is a pretty solid job for a first time director. However, Spielberg seems to be able to achieve that misty-eyed sentimentality of movie magic. There is a feeling that permeates a Spielberg movie that says &#34;We are on the right side of history,&#34; and that the protagonist is also the moral center of the world around him. Crowe swings for that, but misses to a certain degree, when compared to Spielberg. I could also swear that there are shades of &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; in this movie.  If Crowe is going to emulate someone, Spielberg is a great place to start, although of course I hope Crowe develops his own voice as time goes on.  There are very few movies that really nail the time period, and there usually seems to be a modern edge around a historical movie. On the very short list of movies that seemed totally authentic, there would be &#34;Schindler's List,&#34; and &#34;The Artist.&#34; &#34;TheWater Diviner&#34; comes off feeling ever so slightly modern, and doesn't nail the time period, but that doesn't kill the movie. Overall, I knock off a few stars because there are a few moments that are a little too mystical and not believable, and a lot of the moments that are supposed to have serious gravity that kind of seem a little too ho-hum and casual. That feeling permeates the movie and drags it down a little. If we had a grittier movie with more realistic war scenes, then we'd have a substantially better movie. It also drags the movie down that Joshua Connor is somewhat of a victim throughout the movie, and the whole thing has a weepy tone. Great attempt by Crowe, but nothing here stands out resoundingly. 2.5 stars.",2015-08-26,0.5,False,0

She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say &#34;emotionally charged love triangle&#34; which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.<br /><br />The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees &#34;A is for Adam.&#34; One would conclude what &#34;Z&#34; would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.<br /><br />The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it. Please note, there is a latency period of &#34;puking&#34; and general sickness when one is exposed to radioactivity. The latency period depends on the amount of exposure from a week to immediately.

It's completely ridiculous and detracts from the heart of the characters and storylines we were beginning to care about. I was really disappointed that the families and kids we were getting to know were not even in the second season, and the sisterhood of the widows that felt so meaningful was almost gone. Instead we had to spend so much time with Elizabeth's annoying sisters and stuffy parents, as well as witness argument after argument where no one took responsibility or heard one another. It felt as fake and stupid as a CW show. What I liked about this show was how REAL and old fashioned everything felt in Season 1. I sincerely hope they remember the roots of this show in the next season. I was a little embarrassed for everyone.",2015-08-30,0.8571428571428571,True,0

This caught my eye on Netflix with the tag line &#34;While right and left remain hopelessly divided, the real enemy, corporate greed, slips by unchecked.&#34;  This makes it seem like it is a bi-partisan film that could point out common ground that the Progressives movement and the Tea Party movement could stand on- reforming crony-capitalism and corporate tax dodging.  This is a real problem and I am convinced huge corporations do benefit to the taxpayers economic detriment; I think that is something we can all agree on.  The proposed solution however is anything but bipartisan; legislate more, tax more, spend more,..... a good chunk of the film is spent filming the whiny 'they are taking away my entitlements' by protestors and 'community organizers' and bashing republicans for wanting to curtail spending.  I do give them props for the segment showing the POTUS's financial backers.<br />True economic reform will only come when we REDUCE gov't control of the economy and end the preferential treatment crony-capitalists receive through lobbying and campaign donations.  These corporations and their bedfellow politicians have a symbiotic relationship and that isn't going to change if you vote democrat/progressive; they are financed by corporations and special interest groups to the same extent that republicans are.  Transferring wealth from large corporate bank accounts to the US Treasury still does not do anything for the citizens of the US.... unless you are a non-contributor.  We need campaign finance reform.  We need to close loop holes and a new tax code.  We need to evict our entrenched career politicians on both sides of the fence.  Ultimately we need a smaller, less intrusive government that allows a free market in which large companies are less powerful because they do not own politicians and dictate legislation to their benefit.	2015-08-29

US	22062038	R1LQ5BA4OU4CCP	B00HYI8A08	387216150	About Time	Digital_Video_Download	5	0	1	N	Y	A movie about  functional loving family and the positive results - even if some had to be repeated. Recommended.	I am not sure where the R rating comes in this movie.  There are some implied sex scenes and some undressing scenes; but nothing beyond what normally is considered PG-13 as far as I can tell.  This shows how a loving family can help a dysfunctional member.  Though this movie involves time travel - try it over and over till you get it right type of time travel; it also is a really good at showing wholesome family relations.  Every one has their own personalities and strengths and weaknesses they all mesh and the relationships are good.  Some important results come from getting to repeat them till they are gotten right; but others require getting it right without time travel.  The acting is superb.  The music is superb.  The dialog is excellent.  The screen play is well constructed.  The characters are complex and well developed.  The only real violence in the movie is a car accident and a not-so-nice guy getting kicked and punched (one each) by the girl he was not so nice to. The plot was good. I don't discuss the plot details so as not to ruin the movie for review readers; but try to give my opinion on the quality.  I liked the movie.  I rented it and will buy it so I can see it as often as I want.  I recommend it.	2015-08-29

Don't get me wrong this is b-grade cinema full of bad acting, cheesy fx and a highly questionable script at it's best.  The film gives a good ole tip of the plaid Ed Gein style hat to Evil Dead 2.  I thought of two other low budget films, Things and Gutpile, while watching this classic '80's gem.  The soundtrack was all over the place featuring multiple genres of music.  Sometimes the music seemed appropriate but it never seemed to compliment the overplayed bad acting.  I really liked the stop motion animations and other camera tricks.  There is buckets of gore sprinkled through out film and crazy monster puppets.  If you like cheesy '80's b-movies such as, Redneck Zombies, Things, or can appreciate a low budget film that tries to be Evil Dead, you are going to get a kick out of Frostbiter:  Wrath of the Wendigo.	2015-08-29

In a matter of ten years, he’s managed to direct eighteen feature films (including his latest “Digging For Fire”). Most of these have been made completely outside of the studio-system, being financed through credit cards and actors donating their time. They’re purely improvisational, with Swanberg’s only tool being an outline that he’s authored. The actors, in turn, must completely inhabit their characters to the point of knowing what they might say or even do. “Digging For Fire”, which is undoubtedly his most star-studded film to date, takes this to a whole new level. Veterans such as Sam Elliott and Judith Light are sharing the screen with younger actors like Jake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br /><br />The latter couple playing a husband and wife who, after finding a rusted gun and apparent human bone in the backyard of a house they’re staying in, are lead on separate adventures over the course of one weekend. The husband - obviously more curious about what else he might find - invites a group of his long-time friends to drink a few beers and dig up the truth. Meanwhile, his wife takes their son to visit her parents and get away from some of the marital stresses she’s facing.<br /><br />It’s this wonderfully odd comedy/mystery that’s entirely propelled by the connection between the actors and the director. There’s an evident trust between the two, and the movie is infinitely better for that. Not to mention the fact that it’s just a lot of fun to watch. The varied cast works together beautifully (some of the others include Orlando Bloom, Anna Kendrick, and Sam Rockwell) and the story unfolds in a charming and clever fashion.

While both films share some similar thematic points or character qualities, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is a bit more meandering in terms of unfolding it story-line. It's one of those &#34;Hollywood' set screwball comedies with a few graphic bursts of violence and craziness. Christopher Walken is very good in it, but his performance doesn't feel like much of a stretch for him. The character he played felt written for what we would expect him to act like anyway. Tom Waits has a fun cameo in it. He plays a variation on a Dexter like serial killer. I like the cast overall and it's (mostly) fun to hang out with them for the duration. Sam Rockwell is the crazy funny guy with Farrell acting mainly as the straight man here, Woody Harrelson is entertaining as a very angry mob guy who loves his little dog. It's a fun film but nowhere even close to as good as IN BRUGES which is just terrific IMO. Both films share a sense of humor that is very dark, but the earlier film delivers on the set-up in a way this one falls short of. If you enjoy movies set around L.A. withe a lot odd ball characters, and leavened with bits of over the top nastiness, you'll perhaps like this.",2015-08-27,1.0,True,0

For the most part, Walking Dead does too, although any fan has to admit, they've had their share of occasional slow episodes. It can't be 100% all zombie mayhem all the time and I get that. Character development and a little backstory from time to time flesh out a situation and make things whole, make them more real. Character development is a necessary evil. Being at the embryonic stage of episode number one, FTWD is just spooling up so we need to learn a bit about the lives, concerns and situations of these new characters and I get that too, but sheesh! Enough is enough. An hour and a half of mundane talk about college courses and teen angst gets a little thin real quick. And a television series featuring a junkie, a person weak by their very nature, as a major character is lame to begin with. Do these writers know ANYTHING about addicts?! Before the chastisement begins, I've known, and have lost, my share of drug addicted acquaintances so I know about what I speak. I've seen enough friends turned into thieves and zombies by heroin. I don't need to watch one fighting actual, undead zombies on a weekly basis. Besides, that would never happen. He's a junkie and it's heroin. It's what they do. In actuality, instead of going Mad Max against the zombie horde with his dysfunctional (geez, beat us over the head with THAT plot point, why don't they?) yet loving, blended family, he would instead score some smack somehow, again, that's what junkies do, and he'd fire up, nod off on a street corner and become Zombie Chow quicker than you can say what's for dinner. Again, they're junkies. It's what they do. The weak don't miraculously change their ways in a survival situation. Junkies and drunks don't rise to the occasion, throw off their chemical chains, and conquer adversity. They get freaking HIGH. It's what they do. And it's what they do in spite of a loving mother who cries as though addiction is some sort of new revelation and not something she's been living with for years even though we learn it's the same addictive behavior her son, in and out of rehab apparently for years, has been absorbed in for a good, long while. Perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps the series producers aren't planning to long-term anchor one of their lead roles to a junkie, the least dependable person you'll ever find in any situation, let alone a zombie apocalypse. Perhaps he's simply the red-shirted, Star Trek ensign you've never seen before the landing party beamed down, the sacrificial lamb, if you will, already scripted to get his jugular munched a few episodes in. I sure hope so. I truly wanted to watch him get zombie-gobbled about a half hour in.diction is some sort of new revelation and not something she's been living with for years even though we learn it's the same addictive behavior her son, in and out of rehab apparently for years, has been absorbed in for a good, long while.

I like KUWTK and the spin offs, but I'll admit KUWTK isn't always entertaining.  If you like reality tv there's really no reason to not like this show.  This docu-series feels pretty ground breaking for our pop culture.  What's really interesting about this show, is how it elevates the game for the KUWTK format.  It feels like a more intelligent, more grounded and self aware series than KUWTK.  There's so much honesty here, ironic for &#34;reality tv&#34;, in a way that can't possibly be scripted.  You can't script Caityn's surprised face when she makes her first public appearance in NY for Pride week.  Or the tears that well up in her eyes, or when her voice chokes.  It really allows viewers to empathize with her experience, to understand LGBT and Trans issues in a more broader way.  I love that her cast mates have been part of the Trans community for a long time, and they really do seem to care for one another, and they are kinda like the fairy godmother in Caityln's Cinderella story.  I also love to see which outfits that Caitlyn wears, she has a style that is more elevated and sophisticated than the Kardashian's.  It will be interesting to see how I am Cait affects future seasons of KUTWK, hopefully it makes it better.

That's when I noticed the miracle of a brand new day ...""","It's insightful in its own way, but I wish it had spent more time with the writer's relationship with their agent (if any), to show the complete picture of the writer's career (if any) from start to finish.  It would have also been better to add screenwriters who were on the verge of a career into the mix of the interviews. David was the only intelligent one of the three: got an industry-related job, wrote a genre film that was marketable enough for a producer to pick up, and &#34;didn't quit his day job&#34; even when the script was produced (and eventually released)  The other two screenwriters were, frankly, just sad - so sad that I wonder if they were put in just for fodder. Deborah's story was painful to watch, but her project seemed doomed from the start. Her trailer was terrible; and her goal and approach were unrealistic. She had barely two months living expenses saved, has never written or directed a feature before ... yet she was banking on attaching Adrien Brody to finance her film? And all within the span of these two months?  But the most annoying (and deluded) screenwriter was Joe, who seemed to have a false sense of superiority regarding his own talent. Twenty years writing and it seems he still sucks. And the script consultant he went to (Dara Marks) didn't help any - it was apparent she just fed his ego enough to get him to come back and pay her more money. His ending statement is typical of a neophyte that feels Hollywood intentionally produces crap because they are oblivious to his genius. A genius that, according to him, can't get any better than the one script he's been perfecting for the last three years.  The table reading he did with those actors felt like listening to someone scratch a chalkboard. You could cut through the artsy-pretentiousness of his script with a knife.  &#34;I know this is naive, but if there's a God, why would he allow that? What reason could there --?&#34; (crying) &#34;Don't even say it. If you question everything youthought you knew ... And you realize it's just not real. And you have no worth. YOU HAVE NO WORTH.&#34; &#34;That's when I noticed the morning sun ... That's when I noticed the miracle of a brand new day.&#34;  Uh ... huh? And he wonders why no one wants to put millions (not a kazillion) of dollars into his rambling voice-over monologue-heavy period-piece coming-of-age story? I know L.A. is the land of deluded screenwriters and artists (or is it artistes now?), but in all seriousness, what kind of fairy dusty is this idiot smoking that he thinks anyone would even think of watching this crap? There was another film he made, Crazy Jones, which he Produced, Directed, Wrote and Starred In (talk about self-aggrandizing megalomania) by mortgaging his house; and not surprisingly, it never got released. I felt sorry for his wife and autistic daughter who had to put up with all this.

These Christians got &#34;comfortable&#34; socializing with their own, and forgot that part of the command of being a Christian is spreading the Good News and being charitable. The turning point is when a man comes to town in search of work so he can rebuild his life. The written story is a good reminder to us Christians about not becoming complacent and blind to what's going on around us.<br /><br />As part of our homeschool curriculum my son read the story In His Steps. I wanted to reinforce that study with something visual which seems to work really well with him. So I did a search online to see if there had been any film adaptation of the story; lo and behold, I found this.<br /><br />You can tell right away that this is a church production and that they've &#34;modernized&#34; the story. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the situations are rather unrealistic, but it's a noble attempt to capture the heart of the original story. The sluggish pace and awkward interactions might make you want to shut it off, but it has its moments where they've portrayed the mindsets and struggles well. Even though the theme itself is something we can all benefit from remembering, we were able to make sport of the movie when it really got cheesy and long-winded.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend nor dissuade someone from seeing it.

In Christian art, for example, St. Paul is pictured as a balding man holding a book or sword.  The book or sword represent the epistles he wrote and the sword that beheaded him. An illiterate audience would be able to look at an icon of St. Paul and know that it is St. Paul who is being depicted from these iconographic conventions.  Similarly, in Indian art, hand and arm positions represent \\""mudras\\"" which express particular emotions or mental states.  Although Westerner might know know the precise state being communicated to the same depth as people of the culture, they can still intuit what is being communicated.<br /><br />This movie focuses on the repetition of artistic conventions that are found throughout human prehistoric art. Thus, we have snake images in Egypt, China and Meso-America. Sun disks are found in Egypt, Peru, China and the American southwest. It is simply a fact that human beings seem to arrive at the same artistic conventions throughout the world, notwithstanding tens of thousands of years of separation.<br /><br />Why is that?<br /><br />Good question.<br /><br />This movie doesn't really answer the question.  The movie is slow moving and consists of providing quotes from otherwise unidentified persons - I recognized science fiction writer Joan Vinge as one of the authorities only because I like some of Joan Vinge's stories - and then providing images of the parallel iconography to the accompaniment of slow narration.<br /><br />The movie - in a slow and ponderous fashion - does visually make a good case for questioning the conventional wisdom that the recurrence of conventional tropes seems a bit much of mere coincidence, but it does not offer an explanation until the end when it gestures at visitors from another planet. This last is helped by prior sections on the interesting fascination of our ancestors in moving large rocks for no real reason apart from \\""art.\\"" I am not sure that this was a sufficient pay-off for the prior investment of time in watching the slow, ponderous presentation of the evidence. I would have been interested in seeing other explanation discussed, such as common human anthropology or pre-Columbian global communication.<br /><br />Obviously, if you are someone deeply committed to UFOs, then your appreciation for this movie will differ from mine.

I remember exactly where I was when this occurred and how I and my family dealt with it. It is so important that we as a nation never forget this poignant part of our history as those who ignore history are destined to repeat it.  I saw this film when it originally aired on CBS in 2002.  It was incredible to watch then and it still is incredible to watch so many years later.  I purchased the video over a decade ago because it was such a meaningful record of what occurred that day in NYC.  It is a totally different perspective of 9/11 and gives you a sense of how this affected those first responders.  After watching the film you begin to really understand what it means to be a NY firefighter.  By chance these filmmakers just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time.  However, I am thankful they tasteful complied this historical record and gave a sense of the deep tragedy which we all know as September 11th.  You think after a decade you have seen all you possibly can about 9/11 documentaries, then you realize this is THE documentary which truly summarizes how Americans felt on that day.  At the end, pictures are shown of all the firemen who perished In the towers and as I was watching I kept thinking .....when are these photos going to end? How long is this going to be? There are more photos...over and over.....it is riveting.  A must see for every American.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,1

That was what started the whole custody thing. 2) Buzz acted as the attorney in the first custody hearing and WON. I know that p***ed her family off. 3) When Buzz died, Kim had an 8 month old daughter from him and was pregnant with a son who was born 2 months after the murder.

Jeong Bae (Lee Sun-kyun) is a struggling artist in the manga (called &#34;manhwa&#34; in Korea) world of sex and violence comic books. He learns of a contest with a first prize of $100,000 USD. The only problem is that Jeong Bae needs a script writer to complement his artistic skills. He interviews various candidates, all of whom do not exactly fit into his scheme of a hero who can combine manga type sex and violence into a winning formula.  Enter Han Da-rim (Choi Kang-hee) whose own sleazy background is acceptably graphic. The romance of the film begins with the inevitable bickering between her vision of a hero and his. She sees Jeong Bae as one who is locked into a losing image of commercial manga art whereas he sees her as too graphic (if one can be so in manga) to work with. Much of PETTY ROMANCE is replete with manga style animation with a stylized female assassin fetchingly clad as she slices and dices her way through legions of hapless victims.  There is little doubt however that this bickering will by the closing credits lead to a satisfying climax of personal and professional success. There is nothing petty about PETTY ROMANCE. The leads bounce off each other in ways that seem somehow real despite the unreality of their linking professions.  One can sense that PETTY ROMANCE is a fine example of a Hollywood style romance of the 1930s that is just as entertaining today in Korea as Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were in their heyday.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

I knew this wasn't going to be your typical Leprechaun movie when I heard the first menacing snarls and growls from the monster before he was actually shown on screen. The title of this movie is undoubtedly misleading. If you are going to call a movie &#34;Origins&#34; then it's kind of a no-brainer that you should depict how something came into existence--the whys and the hows. Upon reading the reviews, I saw that many took issue with the fact that the leprechaun did not in any way resemble the original character. That didn't really bother me, although I kept waiting for the reveal that would explain how this creature evolved into the Leprechaun we know from the other movies. I surmised that maybe the filmmakers just didn't procure the rights to make a Leprechaun movie with the likeness or characteristics of the other little dude, so they went ahead with this reimagined tale. That seems to be the only logical explanation. Another hiccup I noticed is that this story takes place in modern times, and we've seen from the other movies that ol' Lep has been about his evil shenanigans for centuries, so the continuity is definitely off if this is supposedly an origins story.

I saw this across my Netflix dash and wanted to see what it was about and, strangely enough, it was the title that peaked my interest. It's just a strange title. At any rate, on to the good stuff. José Sacristán and the beautiful and illustrious Maria Valverde have a really good chemistry and the film may seem kind of strange in that it takes place, most of the time, in a small room with just the two of them (not to give too many spoilers away) and it's about a writer interviewing a legendary journalist and finds out way more about his life (and vice versa) than she originally bargained for. On Netflix, it got 1 out of 5 stars and despite that I wanted to try it for myself. This is not to say that reviews are typically not to be trusted, but reviews of movies are relative and to really see if you would like something you have to try it for yourself. This was a great risk I took and it was well worth it. It's a great movie that's full of intrigue and oddities.<br /><br />I'd say I'd recommend this film to those that are looking for a pretty good story and how strange scenarios can turn into a great scenario.",2015-08-23,0.5,False,1

In between commercials for these two shows, they occasionally show commercials for iZombie, but I've always ignored them.

The atmosphere is dark and playful at the same time, the dialog is quick and witty, and the plot is crazy!

He googles pictures of the sun.,"In a time where Vampires, werewolves, and even zombies are being put through the &#34;Twilight&#34; treatment, stripping them of all their terror and replacing it with lukewarm sex appeal, What We Do In The Shadows takes the desiccated husk of all these poor horror icons and injects them with some humorous new life. Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.<br /><br />With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially &#34;come out&#34; to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.<br /><br />Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time.",2015-08-31,0.8620689655172413,True,1

Olivier Assayas's &#34;Irma Vep&#34; was transcendent and amazing, and sometimes I feel that it is my favorite movie of all time. However, I get the feeling that that movie was based on improvisation, and that less rigid nature is what made it so incredible. I feel pretty sure that &#34;Clouds of Sils Maria&#34; is scripted, so it is too rigid, and the only good thing about &#34;Irma Vep&#34; is gone. Lacking great photography, production value, or mise en scene, there is nothing great about this movie, or any other Assayas movies, save &#34;Irma Vep.&#34; It hurts to say that because &#34;Vep&#34; was  so great and even brilliant. However, this movie is a stick in the mud. Kristen Stewart's reluctant energy permeates through her whole role, but while it sunk her role and dragged the movie down a notch, I'm not even sure that the movie would have been any better even with a better actress in her role. Binoche is ok, but certainly doesn't save the movie either.  The movie's fatal flaw is its foundation: its dreadfully boring premise and script, which is almost completely dialogue. The movie is overly complex and tedious, talking about characters that are barely in the movie and seemingly inconsequential. The chattery girl-talk puts your emotions in overdrive, and it is hard to believe that a man directed this. So much of the movie is this hormonal girl-talk and gossip. It amounts to talking about things that happen, but not really seeing anything happen, and it's pretty frustrating. The movie over-philosohpizes about a play we never really see, except for a few seconds at the end.  I suppose this movie has a central theme (aging), but it skips around something fierce. That loose energy could be interesting if we had the feeling of &#34;Irma Vep,&#34; but we don't. At the end of the day, this movie is something drowning at sea, and nothing really saves it. If you want to see a piece of brilliance, see &#34;Irma Vep,&#34; that is brilliant, and everything that makes French cinema great, and everything that this movie is trying to be. The same could be said of &#34;Ponette,&#34; and &#34;Force Majeur.&#34; Those are all incredible French movies, and I recommend you see them instead. &#34;Clouds of Sils Maria&#34; is too meticulous, and belabors an uninteresting point: an actress preparing for a role, and the fear that she is a has-been. What is supposed to be so interesting about this movie are the philosophical points of practicing for a role, but it is way too dry. The majority of the plot focuses on a play and events that happen off screen, and it makes the action as dry as sand. This movie also features women acting crazy together, which if you're a guy, really doesn't speak to you. However, even if you're a woman, I don't think you'll like this movie either. I hate giving Olivier Assayas less than 5 stars, but that is really what this movie deserves. I give it 1.5 stars. When a movie is so creative and not just a brainless action explosion-fest, I really want to give it 5 stars, or at least make it clear that it is on another level than an action movie that I'd give the same rating to. But I also have to be clear in that this movie achieved none of its goals. Don't get me wrong, &#34;Godzilla&#34; was totally brainless, and although I gave it more stars than this, it is down on some dumber level in which it achieved more stars in its attempt to do what it was trying to do: simply entertain the audience with explosions. Kudos to Assayas for trying something more creative than what you see at the MegaPlex, but this movie didn't hit its own marks.",2015-08-22,0.4444444444444444,False,0

Riveting ""intellectual"" movie with wistful undercurrent","\\""The End of the Tour (2015 release; 106 min.) brings the true story of the 5 days that Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky (played by Jesse Eisenberg) hangs out with writer David Foster Wallace (played by Jason Segel) back in 1996. As the movie opens, we her an announcement that Wallace has committed suicide in 2008, and Lipsky is asked to provide a testimonial on NPR. We then see him drifting to \\""12 Years Earlier\\"", when Wallace's book \\""Infinite Jest\\"" is just released to universal acclaim. Lipsky wants to do a story on Wallace, and asks his editor: \\""do you know how many writers Rolling Stone has interviewed in the last 10 years? none!\\"", and the editor agrees to let him do the piece. Off to Illinois goes Lipsky. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: this is the latest movie by up-and-coming director James Ponsoldt, who previously brought us the outstanding indies \\""Smashed\\"" and \\""The Spectecular Now\\"". This guy is going places in a hurry. The movie's script is based on Lipsky's 2010 memoir \\""Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself\\"", itself published to critical acclaim. As to the movie, I was tempted to reference it as an \\""action of the intellect\\"" movie in the title of this review but then I wondered if it would be too confusing or, worse, off-putting. But in the end, this movie is for all practical purposes the same as, say, Jurassic World or the latest Mission Impossible action movie, but in this case all of the action happens in the brain. Wallace and Lipsky pretty quickly get into all kinds of in-depths conversations about love, loneliness, fame, writing, basically life itself. And yes there is humor too (the bits about Alanis Morissette are hilarious, remember this is set in 1996). But on top of all that, knowing what would happen 12 years on, the movie has definitely a wistful undercurrent. Jason Segel, previously best known for \\""Jeff, Who Lives At Home\\"", \\""The Muppets\\"", and \\""The Five Year Engagement\\"", brings a performance that is so far beyond anything he has done before, it will simply blow you way. Watch Segel rack up a ton of honors and nominations when the award season comes around later this year and early 2016. Eisenberg is good too, but the role is inherently less daring than Segel's (nothing Eisenberg can do about that). Check out as well the small role for Mamie Gummer as one of Wallace's friends (I just saw her a few weeks ago in Ricki and the Flash). last but not least, this is a bit of a road movie, and hence there is a lot of music in the film. Both the original score (from Danny Elfman) and the songs throughout the movie (opening with REM's New Orleans Instrumental No. 1) all the way through the end (with Tindersticks' cover of Pavement's \\""Here\\"") is just outstanding.<br /><br />I had been eagerly looking forward to \\""The End of the Tour\\"". It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and went right away to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great.

The acting was so real. The emotions were raw. I loved it. Outsiders thought the Wheelers were special and hypnotic.They were and the feeling was shared by both Frank and April.They had the American dream and the sky was the limit for these two and their children. The perfect family but April wanted more. Frank wanted to make April happy but her dream to run away, live in Paris and find themselves sounded fantastic but life got in the way and Frank couldn't leave security for an unknown future. Watching this movie was like being a fly on the wall, being privy into their complex marriage. The acting was so real and so believable. It was like they weren't acting at all. It was spellbinding! The era was portrayed exactly as it was then. Women just wanted to get married, have children and live the 1950's American dream.But, April wanted more. She said she was suffocating. She was unhappy and she looked desperately for a way out, another kind of life that held promise of excitement and uncertainty. She was bored. Being a mother was unfulfilling for her and her marriage was too safe. Poor Frank. He would have done anything for her but throwing away everything he had worked so hard for was not going to happen.. He thought for awhile he could share her fantasy, but in the end he couldn't do it. Most people thought Frank was in control but in all truth it was April. He tried so hard to fulfill her life but nothing he could do would ever satisfy her. April was a very unhappy woman but it was far more than that. She was mentally ill. She had all the characteristics of being by-polar. She was plagued with constant highs and lows and from the outside looked in she appeared very appealing but it was anything but. She was sexually hyper. Her hormones had a lot to do with that but it was also part of her illness. When she started dancing in the bar with her neighbor it was all premeditated on her part and the neighbor, always desiring her went right along with her game. I was mesmerized by her dance and her oozing sexuality. Throughout her marriage to Frank their sex life was thoroughly enjoyed by both of them but I suspect for her it was much more than that. It is a characteristic of bi-polar, extreme sexuality. She showed manic behavior and chronically depressed behavior throughout their marriage. Yes, she was bi-polar but she also had other mental disorders. She was not able to love. At the end of the movie she had a complete psychotic break. She was not able to distinguish reality from depressive psychosis. She was in desperate need of hospitalization to stabilize her deep depression, because all she could see was hopelessness. This was the 50's and this behavior was not easily recognizable in those years. I felt so sorry for Frank. They were both young, immature and prideful but he inherently was a good, stable man. He loved April with all his heart but she couldn't return the feelings because she had none for him or her children. The thought of her having another child made her suicidal. The botched abortion was her way of committing suicide. She didn't see a way out because of her depression. Death to her was a release from her tormenting life. That was the illness talking. She had so much to be grateful for and many reasons to be happy but because of her mental illness, what looks good to others is not shared or felt with her. After her break from reality when she begged Frank to stop talking and leave her alone, Frank was beside himself and in anger retaliated with harsh words that Alice couldn't feel. The next morning, Alice appeared to be over her tantrum and Frank was so happy and releaved. He asked her if she hated him and her response was of cause not.That was a true response from her because she had no feelings for him. They were all for herself and her deep depression. Frank was so releaved. He didn't want to see the truth and accept the fact that she was mentally ill. He didn't know how to deal with that, so he left for work, knowing deep inside things were precariously dangerous. Such a sad movie. The acting is so intensely wonderful. I highly recommend this movie!",2015-08-28,0.75,False,1

The vote, however, was tainted by the foreman, who set up a &#34;us. vs. her&#34; situation: if she is re-hired, the workers won't be getting their bonuses .. and who doesn't want bonuses?<br /><br />Over the course of the weekend (two days, one night) Sandra, with the constant help of her husband, musters up the courage to try to contact all 8 (or so) employees to get them to change their minds.  There are ups and downs, humiliation, and exhaustion, but she soldiers on. There is a built-in narrative tension as Sandra works through the list and we see how close it's going to be.  Of course, the list dwindles, so there are diminishing possibilities as the movie nears the end.  At one point, in the viewing I saw, audience members cheered and clapped fitfully for a late conversion by one of Sandra's colleagues.  It's kind of like a variation of Seven Samurai, or The Magnificent Seven, only this time the recruits to Sandra's cause do not do battle, but try to save her job.

The tone of the movie begins with a child home alone on her birthday, her mother is a workaholic and doesn't have time for her.  Because of this dynamic, I suppose the writer felt I should accept the fact the girl says she will never forgive her mother, the mother is concerned she will runaway, and the mother's coworker offers up that when he was upset as a child he would hide in the house.  After the girl has announced she will never forgive her mother, and some weird blob that looks like some light force hovers in the sky, and the girl almost prays to it to come take her away, her wish is granted.  Poof she's transported to some jungle world where a blue boy and his grandfather live.

But I still wanted to leave a review.)<br /><br />First of all, I am only going to focus on the theme of the show: &#34;Raising&#34; Asia. I refuse to say anything negative about Asia, herself, because she IS only a small child, after all. She works incredibly hard, and she's undeniably talented. Yes, some of the dance moves and costumes are, for the most part, very risque. But again, that's the way the child was RAISED. It's the PARENT'S fault that they had ALLOWED her to dance that way, or to dress that way.<br /><br />She's a CHILD, she needs PROPER PARENTAL GUIDANCE!<br /><br />The other sad thing that I've noticed, is that this poor little girl is being pushed so hard! And no matter how exhausted she is her mother, Christie, continues to push her beyond her physical limits. It's unhealthy!<br /><br />Asia is also losing out on a normal childhood. It breaks my heart to see this little girl pining away for a little normalcy. She'd love nothing more than to go swimming, ice skating, or to jump on a trampoline, but her mother is so worried that she might hurt herself and not be able to dance, that she refuses to allow her child to do normal, fun things. She's only going to be a child for so long. Why take that away from her?<br /><br />Dance isn't everything!<br /><br />Plus, Christie has another child, Bella Blue (?) who she ignores all the time. Christie's husband (their father) is basically raising Blue, which isn't a bad thing because you could tell that he absolutely loves her, and that he enjoys his time with her. PLUS, she gets to do the childlike things that Asia would love to do.<br /><br />But not only is Christie ignoring Bella Blue, she refuses to allow her husband to &#34;intrude&#34; in the way SHE wants to raise Asia. And he feels understandably left out!! So not only is she ignoring her youngest child, she's also ignoring her husband, as well.<br /><br />And Christie's relationship with her own mother and sister is terrible! She treats them so poorly, and talks down to them. I just can't imagine treating those that I love like that! Especially my MOTHER!!<br /><br />Christie obviously has some SERIOUS problems. She lives vicariously through her daughter, and doesn't like to lose control of her. It's almost like Asia is her puppet, and she wants her puppet to live the life that SHE wanted (or wants) to live. She does NOT care how exhausted her daughter gets, how sad either of her children are, or how left out they both feel in their own way. She doesn't care that she treats her husband so poorly, or how much she USES people!!<br /><br />She's TRULY a terrible person!!<br /><br />Because of that, and because of the fact that (basically) the only person who is &#34;RAISING ASIA&#34; is her mother, it's no wonder that that poor child acts out!!<br /><br />I could NEVER imagine myself with a mother like that, and I thank GOODNESS that I've never had to!<br /><br />Now excuse me while I go and hug my own children who mean the WORLD to me, and who I would NEVER treat like that.<br /><br />EVER!!!<br /><br />Their happiness means everything to me!!<br /><br />And it's obvious that Christie doesn't share that sentiment with her own children.<br /><br />How SAD!!!!! :(",2015-08-29,0.9,True,0

My biggest and minor complaint about the realism is when they had Molly supposedly hitting 4 bullseyes with the pistol after never having fired one before.  The characters, including that of Ethan the Android Humanich son , JD the former cop, and .Molly Woods (played by Halle Berry), the former astronaut and now hybrid, are all interesting.        After watching all 11 episodes of Season 2, I am even more impressed than after season 1.  Several actors/actresses and their characters were very engaging.  The projections of future technology in Extant ,which appears to be at least 20 years into the future,such as even more ubiquitous surveillance and recording of everything and the quantum leap in AI were all believable.  The intelligence shown by the World Threat Assessment master computer and the humanichs--androids with the very nearly exact appearence of humans--is very impressive but not so extreme as to be ridiculous or even highly unlikely.  I liked the profile of the hybrid human-aliens as being generally peaceful but with some hostility to humans.  The escape of the alien spores containing the DNA of an alien race about to be wiped out from some unspecified global catastrophe and then by infecting/mating with humans--is a pretty imaginative mutation on the familiar Superman/Supergirl escape from Krypton.   Among the more progressie,non-male-chauvanist high points in character development, was the roughly 60 year-old woman Secretary of HomeSec, the future Dept. of Homeland Security, Fiona Stanton, played by Kate Burton, who was an earthy, tough boss every bit as intimidating as a macho male boss would be, yet a fair person.  While there may be a minor problem with some perhaps gratuitous sex thrown in such as in the ubiquitous cleavage displayed by Berry, which is a good hook for heterosexual males, Berry succeeds in evoking a wide and deep range of emotion, ranging from wisecracking to extreme anger and irespressible independance to great sadness and affection.  Although JD Richter, the detective and on-demand cop played by J Dean , was initially a bit off-putting with his loose sexual behavior, he  progressively is shown to be a very good and honest human being with courage and whose &#34;problem with authority&#34; helps Molly to be able to escape from the federal /global authorities trying to stop her from figuring out and revealing how the alien invasion/landing has inadvertantly led to what looks like murders of young pregnant women.

Episodes go over material we already know from the second season and then drags out the subplot involving Teddy and Tawney--is she going to divorce him or not?--as well as Trey and the Sheriff subplot--will the inexplicably dumb Sheriff finally figure out that Trey is guilty or not?--as well as the Samantha and Jon subplot--will they stay split or not?  The finale is particularly weak.  I thought maybe Peter Jackson had directed as it seems like one extended scene after another.

She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say &#34;emotionally charged love triangle&#34; which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.<br /><br />The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees &#34;A is for Adam.&#34; One would conclude what &#34;Z&#34; would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.<br /><br />The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it.

I think people from outside New Zealand are intrigued because of the culture as well as the topography. While it's true the culture is being influenced by outside forces of immigration, the show focuses only on the liberal progressive side of this welcoming of outsiders. It makes clear judgments in favor of the ever-increasing melting-pot and dwindling ties with traditional European ties. There are also people in NZ who oppose such fast-paced change and resist breaking with traditional NZ culture.  While I'm not making a value judgment here, I find the film-making to be one-sided and therefore not truly representative of the culture. It's more like a propaganda tourist video of the left, welcoming everyone with open arms, without regard for the potential culture-clashes that can result.<br /><br />All that being said, the narration is done quite well, though they could have gotten someone with a more Kiwi-centric accent.

I love Kristen Wiig and her choices of movies, and I really think that Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix is a good actor, but I can't say the same about these two. Although, Adam Pally is better at it than Sarah Burns is in this, but I have to admit, I have not seen either of them in any other movie (that I am aware of) so I can't really say they are bad actors 100% of the time, only in this. I felt for both of these people they were portraying immediately, I actually cared for them, I had high hopes. About midway through, I stopped caring for her completely, mainly I guess (maybe) it could be that she may actually had been acting so well that her character made me dislike her, but, whatever, I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted that to happen. (The script itself is probably at fault here , so that also means all of those in charge were at fault) In any movie you need to care about the characters, if you go too far and those in charge make you actually stop caring, you are going to be on a very slippery slope, and these slid all of the way down the hill as far as I was concerned. Yes, I do know that Sarah's character was supposed to be this way, but too much is just too much. The character, &#34;Beth&#34; would've been a better choice for Sarah's part, I feel, I liked her more, and she had some acting skills and her and Adam had good chemistry together.<br />The premise for this movie was good enough, I liked the idea, and had it been handled by writers and directors, plus, the actors, just a little better, I would be writing a different review. (I am not a very good reviewer, I only do this if I am 'trying to' help someone either see a good movie, or, stay away from one that may be considered a bad one)<br />Also really, I am not a prude at all, but this had quite a bit of raunchy humor in it that was unnecessary, there is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy. (That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again. Keep it clean, use the proven track record of movies in the past that succeeded without having to resort to lowering its standards to appeal to today's internet types. Above all, NEVER, EVER have Rosie O. in any of your movies... :) (I had to say it)<br />Anyway, Slow Learners wasn't all bad, it had some definite funny parts, the two dorky nerds in the book club were the best, they had some genuine comedic lines that made me laugh out loud several times. There were also a few others in this that I liked and did a pretty good job with their parts.<br />Hopefully the two main stars in this movie will get better parts, or learn to act, or something, I don't hate their acting, only in this movie, and I am sure that there will be those that would like this and not see it the way I did, but that's is how I saw it...

Honestly, the film is more of a homage to the 1980s film &#34;Red Heat&#34; (Arnold Schwarzenegger/'James Belushi as russian/american buddy cops) than the man from UNCLE.  For any with memories of the old show, all that is really used here is a few old names. What you have here is a film about nazis and nuclear weapons where the whole point of the thing is exposition explaining the inevitable team-up of the two lead characters. There is also the familiar hackwork attempt at giving the lead characters psychological depth through negative character traits. As per the old hack formula, they are two lone wolves who fight each other and then decide to become partners. The film almost drowns in its own writing cliches.  Mission Impossible proved that the name of an old show could be leveraged for something entirely new. But where Mission Impossible went in the direction of all-out action, UNCLE tried to make it about characters, backstory and 1960s nostalgia. A rather toxic mix that was never going to work. The design work is good. Some of the direction is ok, but there is lots of self-indulgent moments and attempts at humor that fail.  As far as the actors go,  Henry Cavill doesn't have the natural charisma necessary for the role. He would actually have perhaps done better as  Illya Kuryakin. I've never quite understood why people keep trying to cast Armie Hammer as an action lead.  Its not &#34;man from UNCLE&#34;. Its not a great action film.

That breaks down by episode 2, when the writers resort to a stereotype-driven story that divides the core characters and LA landscape in two--the violent, urban, Spanish-speaking inner city of looters and a nice, polite, white suburban neighborhood, where birthday parties come with a blow-up moon bounce even as the Apocalypse approaches. Despite the growling zombies and wailing sirens signaling civilization's fall, you can hear the main characters and minor victims all screaming &#34;youth demographic!!!&#34; The parents/kids-just-don't-understand bit repeats with every one of the too-many teens in the show--largely of the obnoxious variety. That includes the druggie black sheep Nick, the only actor in the cast of the living that seems to have a pulse, and Frank Dillane certainly turns in an energetic performance. He seems to have talent, so I presume it's the stinker of a script and direction responsible for a characterization that seems less starring role and more bad acting class exercise. You can almost hear a teacher giving the assignment to develop a Jekyll and Hyde-style mash-up of Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter as a drug addict. The only actual character that engaged my attention at all was the quiet, doughy Tobias, the geekster wizard who has seen the horrible future coming while spending too many overnight hours online, but even there the writers miss the mark. There's no way a kid like that would decide to trade a locked room and laptop for the &#34;safety&#34; of large numbers of high school peers whose humanity was in question even before zombies attacked! It's true that a certain amount of disbelief has to be suspended for a show like this to work, but there still has to be logic and consistency in the rules that do govern the world being created. Having Tobias come to school to be with more people, come all the way back later because the school was the best place he could think of to find a standard kitchen knife and canned goods, educate his teacher about the new way of the world, and then reject her offer to stay with her group in favor of isolation with a sometimes-around-uncle does NOT make any sense! Yet my preoccupation with that situation illustrates the essential problem with this show. Class, can we say booooooorrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggg????? This show can't and shouldn't be the same kind of high-octane thrill that the original Walking Dead set off by having the lead character wake from a coma to join the Apocalypse already in progress. The backstory of those missing months is a natural curiosity guaranteed to draw people into the more intimate aspects of how it all started, but that's not what we're getting. The only thing viewers have to fear here is whether or not their snoring will wake the neighbors.",2015-08-31,0.75,False,0

Additionally, it can open the person up to the sixth sensorial experiences and the spiritual connections claimed by psychologist and top- selling author James Redfield (see Celestine Prophecy). The human is a key link to creating the building blocks toward a spiritual connection in the here and now. There is sooo much more research needed on this topic and I hope it comes up with a sequel.

He brings such depth to his portrayal that one can well understand why this sociopath was so well regarded by so many.<br /><br />The focus of the movie is from the point of view of an outsider pulled into the drug lord’s extended family through a romantic affiliation with his niece.  Josh Hutcherson portrays Nick, the Canadian surfer, who is unaware of Escobar until falling for his niece.  Nick’s growing awareness of Escobar’s nature as well as his drug empire makes for tense viewing.  We see Escobar as a loving father playing with his own children, while coldly being able to authorize the execution of other people’s children.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro gives such a nuanced performance, flawlessly displaying an appealing and paternal facade to the populace and his family while raising chills of horror in the viewer.<br /><br />I almost skipped this video after seeing the comments about the lack of subtitles.

The program covers this very original individual who has achieved a &#34;cult&#34; fan status, and his very original career. The documentary details West's early Hollywood career and the &#34;Batman&#34; series that he is most remembered for, along with his post-batman career dealing with typecasting and having to accept odd-ball promo appearances as Batman, doing bad b-movies, and such.  Then his resurgence as a &#34;cult favorite&#34; and obtaining his &#34;Family Guy&#34; role, which he is probably second-best known for.  It's inspiring the way Adam lives his life...  In his 80s now, when he's out and about he still has a zest for life and keeps things loose in his professional commitments/travels, amusing those around him with his dry and unique sense of humor...  Also inspiring is that the program doesn't portray Mr. West as a person to pity...even though his acting career didn't always go how he may have liked he seems to have enjoyed the ride and felt fortunate for the life he lived.  And when he did take jobs that didn't always come with a lot of dignity, the dignity was from knowing he was earning a living to support the top priority in his life- his FAMILY.  A side plot of the documentary is Adam's friends, family, and colleagues efforts towards his receiving a Hollywood star on the &#34;Walk of Fame,&#34; and theirs and his feelings of being slighted about his not having received one.

How does a director take an all star cast and make a mediocre movie?  Kevin Kline's character was whinny, selfish and irritating.  Kristen Scott Thomas's character was  bitchy and unlikeable and just plain mean spirited.  The actors played grown children in their 50's who had never dealt with the fact they felt unloved by their parents.Kevin Klines character recounts 2-3 failed marriages and an inability to write the great American novel.  Ms. Scott-Thomas's character has never married, lives with her mother, and is employed by a company forced to keep her employed because of an agreement with one of her parents.  I'm sorry, if you have reached your 50's and have not dealt with your feelings about your parents, then I would suggest some serious therapeutic intervention.  Three-fourths of the way thru the movie, we finally see some redeeming qualities in both, but by then it was too late for me.  Maggie Smith played her part to perfection, as we have all come to expect of this fantastic actor.<br />This movie never seemed to know where it was going or whether it was a comedy, a drama  or both.  The scenery was great, and I kept asking myself, why don't I care about these two people?

Atticus Ross's insights in somehow being able to internalize Brian's music and then adapt it to his life has created the best soundtrack I've heard - it builds on Wilson's genius to the point of possibly being genius in itself.<br /><br />Bill Pohlad's ability to somehow pull that reality into a genuine classic heroic/love story is equally impressive.  The acting is superb in creating the brilliant young Wilson (Paul Dano) and in the later period when Brian was essentially re-inventing himself with the help of his (now) wife Melinda (John Cusack) is equally sensitive and intelligent.  Elizabeth Banks gives a fabulous portrayal of a very strong-minded, yet sensitive and empathetic woman.  I don't want to be a spoiler so won't go into the storyline further.  I will say that I've always loved the work of Paul Giamatti and he's perfect for the role of Dr. Landy.<br /><br />Love & Mercy is worth the purchase so as to easily have several viewings of the film.

In order to acquire some quick cash to get themselves back up they sold the film rights to their properties to several movie studios.  Many of those sales resulted in films of average quality at best, while some were never actually used.  A particular example in-between was the Fantastic Four license.  Producer Roger Corman owned the rights, and they were about to expire because the studio had never made the film.  Instead of letting the rights expire and revert to Marvel, the studio decide to quickly make a film based on the franchise.<br /><br />Due to the way the laws work, they only had to MAKE the film, not release it, and that's precisely what they did.  With a budget of (even back then) the low figure of $1 million they set to work on the film.  Shady as they were, they didn't even tell the cast the film was never to be released (though some people claim the intention of release existed at some point), and the film was made in a period of a bit over three weeks in 1992.  And the public never got to see it, until several years later some bootleg copies started to surface.  This film was the very definition of an &#34;ashcan copy&#34;, which is a film that's made exclusively to keep the rights, without care for the quality of the product.<br /><br />And now, a bit more than two decades later, history repeats itself.  While Fox has owned the film rights to the franchise for a while, and they made a couple of films based on it before, this is the first time where you can see for yourself that care for the product is something that never even entered the mind of the studio.  For better or worse, in the previous two films made by Fox, you can see that they at least tried to cast actors who resembled the characters and at least paid attention to the tone of the source material.  Those films failed in the eyes of the public for being poorly written, not for lack of trying.  This one, though, shows that keeping the rights was not just the studio's priority, it was the only thing they cared about.<br /><br />THE FILM:<br />The, ahem, &#34;plot&#34; of the film goes like this: a young brilliant student called Reed Richards discovers the means to interdimensional teleportation.  Joined by a group of scientists and his best friend, he travels to a faraway land called Planet Zero, where an accident seems to kill one of the team's members (Victor Von Doom) and propels their machine back with a wave that gives the rest of the members strange powers.  Richards' body can stretch like rubber, Johnny Storm can set his body ablaze and fly, his sister Susan can turn invisible and project forcefields, and Richards' friend Ben Grimm's body has turned into living rock, making him super strong and virtually invincible.<br /><br />After this accident, Richards escapes while the rest of the team is taken by the government, where they're trained as soldiers, using their abilities in covert missions.  Richards is found and recruited back into the team to rebuild their machine, which is used carefully by a new group, where they find the still living Doom.  He is then brought back to Earth, where he escapes custody and uses his own newfound powers in an attempt to destroy the planet to sustain his own new world, Planet Zero.<br /><br />ANALYSIS:<br />Now, I know I'm making this sound far more interesting, action-packed and fun than it actually is, so let me elaborate to make sure you understand why it's not.  There's no characterization in this film.  Characters do things without motives (or with stupid ones), and if you ask anyone to define one of the character's personality without looking at the source material, they'll be dumbfounded.  The film is strictly plot driven (that is, things happen because the plot demands them, wheter they make sense or not), and since the plot is almost nonexistent, things go wrong really fast.  Maybe you think there's a reason for all four members of the team to be there at the moment of the accident other than &#34;Oh, crap we forgot there were supposed to be four of them!&#34;.  Perhaps you believe Doom has a valid reason to turn evil and try to destroy everything other than &#34;Eh, let's say he feels like it&#34;.  You might believe there's a reason for Richards to go away and return to the lab in the middle of the film other than &#34;This film needs to be longer than half an hour, darnit!&#34;.  You'd be wrong in all accounts, then.  Remember, this film only had to be made.  They didn't have to try to make it good.<br /><br />Another problem is the change in tone.  The Fantastic Four stories were always lighthearted, full of fun and exploration, and there's none of that here.  They purposely made the tone &#34;dark and gritty&#34; because it's the current fad, but this is one of the franchises where it absolutely doesn't fit.  Granted, the writing is terrible, so it wouldn't work even if it wasn't a Fantastic Four film, but still.  You get the feeling that the film is embarrased of the source material, yet at some points it's far sillier and less realistic.  Yet another problem is the acting.  There are genuinely talented people here, and they all behave like wood planks.  It's obvious they have no interest, no one's having any fun.  Special Effects are OK for the most part, but character and costume design is generic at best and absolutely aneurysm-inducingly hideous at worst.<br /><br />The major problems, though, are the pacing and running time.  A comic book film needs good pacing, and this film drags A LOT.  Hell, you only have one, read it, ONE major action scene.  And when I say &#34;major&#34; I mean, &#34;longer than a minute&#34;.  Most of the film is people talking in cliches interspersed with more people talking in even more cliches.  Once in a while there's a few seconds of action here and there, and it's not until, no joke, the last ten minutes or so that the villain is introduced and the conflict starts.  There are a bunch of scenes shown in the trailers that are not present in the film, and in the one *snort* big action scene only three of the heroes do something to defeat the villain.  Taking into account all that, the film would have beneffited from a longer running time.  It would have helped the characterization a bit (Susan and Ben don't even talk to each other in the entire film).  On the other hand, it probably would have turned out even worse.  Remember the film is full of padding because clearly they had no idea what to fill it with.<br /><br />BEHIND THE SCENES:<br />There have been a lot (and I mean A LOT) of production problems with this film, even before the director was chosen.  Once Josh Trank took the job, many other problems started.  The behind-the-scenes drama of this film would make a fine documentary and it would undoubtedly be much more interesting, fun and full of action than the actual movie.  Who's at fault here?  Trank?  Fox?  Clearly both.  The studio wanted to make a cheap film quick, so they cast a director based on his apparent ability to do that.  Trank, on the other hand, seemed that he bit much more than he could chew.<br /><br />There was a lot of controversy over the casting of Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, as he is a black actor and Storm is a blond white kid.  People who complained were (mostly) unfairly accused of racism (it's like the press never heard about fans complaining about casting), but the truth is that a) Jordan was cast because he was friends with Trank, b) the studio agreed with the decision because if anyone complained about anything related to the film they could accuse them of racism (which, sadly, worked) and c) the film could have had the blondest, whitest kid in the world and it'd still be absolute garbage, so all the controversy is pointless.  Granted, once in a while you'll find someone claiming this particular bit of casting is what sank the film.  Do your best to ignore those people.<br /><br />There were many signs that this film's quality wasn't going to be up to par (or up to anything but someone's hole, for that matter), but those were all ignored because every time someone said anything bad about the film they were labeled as racist.  There was a point, though, where they couldn't be ignored anymore.  The reviews of the film were put on embargo until release day, which is a bad sign 100% of the time.  The reports about problems behind the scenes were so bad that Josh Trank lost his job as director of the Star Wars spinoff film.  The very day of release pretty much everyone involved with the film did their best to disown it, even though up until that very moment they were praising it.  The director and writer of the film claimed their version was very different from what was released.  This is clearly true, since we can see the trailer had a bunch of scenes that aren't even hinted at in the movie.  Yet... curious how up until release day they didn't mention it.  Well, it's not curious, they obviously wanted to keep their jobs, but generally it takes a few years for cast and crew to disown a film (it took several years for Harrison Ford to say anything bad about The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, for instance), but the fact that these people did it inmediately is telling.<br /><br />CLOSING THOUGHTS:<br />Please, PLEASE don't watch this film.  Don't pay for it, that's obvious, there are much better things to spend your money here.  Amazon has a fantastic (tee hee) selection of films you can watch instead.  Chances are picking any one at random you'll find one with more quality.  But don't pirate it either.  If you do, they'll just blame piracy for the lack of revenue instead of lack of quality.  If you MUST see it, wait until home video release and then search the garbage bin of a clueless buyer, where you're most likely to find the disc, where not even raccoons will want anything to do with it.  If what you want to see is a good Fantastic Four film, I recommend Pixar's &#34;The Incredibles&#34;.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four is a very, very fun, entertaining and imaginative comic book, and it pains me to see people believing it can't be successfully adapted into film only because it just so happened that every attempt to do it has been poor.  In the right hands, this could be a wonderful film franchise.  Obviously, Fox's hands are the wrong ones, so don't give them any money, and make sure they know it's their fault.  One day, hopefully, the franchise will reach the hands of someone who cares, and we finally get the film we and the Fantastic Four themselves deserve.ced and the conflict starts.

Otherwise, if you have an interest in this period and what it was like to be in a time of uninhibited sexual exploration, there are some scenes and sociology of the period presented here that are tantamount to a documentary. Take-in Jane Olivor's touching performance and the broadway entertainment at the baths during that time and you will know why this period was so special.  The diversity of the people and the freedom of expression makes this film a gem! It is like a time capsule. The mores (pronounced &#34;morays&#34; in this context), are also spot-on. The 70's were so free, the music was amazing and the openness of sexual expression and honesty, though a bit over the top, was totally refreshing, fun and educational. The relationship of our protagonist with this girlfriend and her openness and acceptance of her boyfriend's untapped interest in having sex with a guy, is totally mature and somewhat typical of the time. Folks were exploring and discovering and not so freaked-out by sexual behaviors that  emerged all along the continuum of rational self-expression. The music was as interesting as the story. We hear an arrangement of Satie's Gymnopedies in the background in many scenes, but also the drumbeat of disco as well. Granted, the acting is a bit stiff and even corny, but it is sincere and honest.  So glad Amazon has this film in its catalog. Enjoy!",2015-08-24,0.6,False,1

Zoe wants to spend the last day together; James wants to go the last great end of the world party.<br /><br />The movie is largely about James' trip to the party, and his realization that even with nothing left, he still needs to be human.  The world that James sets out into is probably far more realistic than the gentle, slightly silly world featured in the similarly themed &#34;Looking for a Friend for the End of the World.&#34;  In this version, bodies are hanging from light poles and children are being kidnapped for rape. James ends up with his car stolen and some other adventures, including rescuing a child, who is about to be raped by two scummy men, and killing the rapists.  James takes the child to the party and gradually comes to realize that in a meaningless time spending more time in the meaningless activities of the party is more than he can bear.  He takes the child to her family and then realizes that he needs to be with Zoe.<br /><br />The end of the movie is both emotionally and visually powerful.<br /><br />If you are a hard-core science fiction view and have a high threshold for nihilistic-inspired violence, or, if you are like me, you can squeeze a drop of meaning out of the end of the world, then this is a terrific movie.

The show used to satirize the lifestyles of &#34;hipsters&#34; and &#34;hippies&#34; [and &#34;progressives,&#34; &#34;naturalists,&#34; &#34;weird people,&#34; and other labeled semi-counter-culturalists], while revealing to the general modern public of &#34;regular folks&#34; that all these situations and characters certainly apply to their lives much more than they originally thought!  However, this fifth season seems to have gone through heavy de-hipsterization, thus making it a show about the aforementioned regular folks, thus rendering it a show about nothing; but Seinfeld it is not!<br /><br />Perhaps I am a little bit biased, since as an avid Portlandia fan, I may be becoming tired of many of the characters.  I would posit that if I had never seen the show before, season five might be a passable prequel to the first four.  I might also be a little biased due to season five's distinct lack of Annie &#34;St. Vincent&#34; Clark.  But that’s just me.",2015-08-29,1.0,True,1

We might as well root for a velosiraptor over the human prey.,"In the 1997 film “Boogie Nights” at the rap up of an adult film the camera man character looks with dismay at what he has helped create and disgustedly comments “It is what it is.”  That may well serve as the epitaph for “Hitman: Agent 47”.  It is what it is.  We do not expect very much from movies based on video games but surely the film makers can do better than this uninteresting, soul-less shoot’um up.  When the high body count tops the list of good things about the movie the movie is not very good.  In days gone by we had a movie actually called “Shoot’um Up” that had a lot more going for it as a tongue in cheek sent up of the genre than this supposedly straight faced actioner.<br /> In the origin film “Hitman” we learn that people have been bio-engineered to be perfect killers.  Things like fear, compassion, love and naturally empathy have no role in these things with a human shape.  In film or literature we need to be able to identify with or at least to understand and like the star of the story, otherwise we have no interest in his life or death, no matter how spectacular the danger he faces.  You can see the problem with the film which has as its center a person with his human qualities stripped from him.  The creators of the film might as well have us rooting for a Zombie or a robot to win out over actual humans.<br /> Sometimes an unlikely film premise can be made interesting by clever writing and innovative directorial tricks.  That would be too much to ask of Polish born first time director Aleksander Bach.  He plods through the film rather than dazzling us with his imagination.  Writers Skip Woods (“Hitman”, “Wolverine”) can do better as can his co-writer Michael Finch (“Predators”, “The November Man”) but apparently the producers asked them to write exactly what they wrote.  Too bad that the level of expectation reached only to the ankle.  We in the dark seats have the expectation that the film makers will reachfor the stars.<br /> We expect and can tolerate plot absurdities in an action film.  One of the characters has ‘subcutaneous titanium’, a sort of a built in flak jacket.  We have seen worse in films about invisible girls, living rock men, walking plant humanoids and the like.  Here it seems like a cheap plot device.<br /> I pity the poor actors trapped in this unpleasant film.  Rupert Friend does what little is possible to make the “Hitman” interesting but fails.  English actress Hannah Ware cannot do much with the role written for her.  Zachary Quinto, lately as Spock in the renewed “Star Trek” franchise does his best.  We also get to see a brief appearance by Chinese actress Angelbaby and in the one good performance in the film, Ciaran Hinds.  I mention Angelbaby only because I love her stage name.  Ciaran Hinds has such power as an actor that anything he does stands out from the background noise.  He has appeared in two of the greatest TV epics, perhaps the two best of all time, “Rome” as Julius Caesar and in the ongoing “Game of Thrones” as Mance Rayder.<br /> I won’t bore you with the details of the plot of a movie made from a very successful Danish video game.  Suffice it to say that the “Hitman” has faster reflexes than ordinary people so he can shoot just a bit faster than anyone else and score a kill shot every time.  He does that over and over and over again with no style or originality.  Ho hum.<br /> This single saw blade time waster caries an “R” rating for violence.  It runs a blessedly short one hour and 36 minutes.  The producers wasted $35 million to make “Hitman: Agent 47” which grossed only $16.7 million worldwide over the three day week end.

Somehow indeed.  I avoided them like dirty sweat sox.<br /> In fairness, somebody likes these movies.  The Scary Movie franchise brought in nearly $400 million at the box office.

I believe that's an absolute necessity.,"Whiplash is a peek in to the mindset that is required to be the best. Taking place in the incredibly competitive world of music, this movie is both instructive, reflective and sometimes scary.<br /><br />Andrew Nieman ( Miles Teller) is a student of the Shaffer Conservatory of Music. Andrew attracts the attention of the most revered teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is a bully, who does everything in power to push the students to the point that they will completely breakdown. He abuses them throughout the time he is with them makes grown men cry. What bothered me  was the fact that none of these grown men had the might to stand up to this lunatic. As Andrew starts getting more and more manic about his desire to be the best drummer. we are caught between our feelings of sympathy for him but also start to hate him because he is slowly turning into a huge ass himself.  He changes rapidly and disses his cousins, his father and breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to spend more time becoming the best drummer.<br />However it is not hard to understand his desire to be the absolute best and how it can sometimes get in the way of all rational things..<br />From the start to end it is J.K. Simmons who presides over things in this movie......I have never seldom seen someone play a jerk so well.<br />For a movie about a psycho teacher and his psycho student, this movie plays at only 107 minutes. Whiplash has a brilliant soundtrack that holds the film together and gives us a new appreciation of the drum set. Release date Oct, 10th 2014.",2015-08-21,1.0,True,1

Warner Bros., like just about every other studio, digs back into the TV vaults and resurrects a popular series from the 1960's.  Directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie (\\""Sherlock Holmes\\""), the film even maintains and early `60's Cold War setting.  Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill, \\""Man of Steel\\"") is an American CIA agent and a former safe cracker and thief.  In exchange for some prison time, Solo is kept on a short leach by Sanders (Jared Harris), his handler.  Armie Hammer (\\""The Social Network\\"") plays Russian KGB agent Illya Kuryakin, who is physically a long way away from his slight TV counterpart, David McCallum.<br /><br />After a fun opening sequence featuring Solo helping an East German auto mechanic named Gaby (Alicia Vikander, \\""Seventh Son\\"") escape to the West, with Kuryakin in hot pursuit, the film slows down a bit so the audience can collect their bearings.  In spite of their Cold War animosity, both sides are concerned that remnants of Nazi Germany are close to acquiring an atomic bomb and are using Gaby's estranged father to put on the final touches.<br /><br />The film has some whiz-bang action sequences and some terrific stunts, but suffers a bit by comparison to the recent \\""Mission: Impossible\\"" film.  The pacing seems a bit erratic.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is a lot of fun and if anything has numerous funny exchanges between Solo and Kuryakin with Gaby often playing the straight man...err woman.  Ms. Vikander, following up on her terrific performance in this year's \\""Ex Machina,\\"" looks to become an \\""A\\"" list superstar.  She shows a keen sense of humor here to go along with her dramatic chops.  Unfortunately she's not the film's focus.  Hugh Grant shows up in the final reel as a British secret service administrator who brings Napoleon and Illya together under the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement umbrella and a likely sequel.

I’m in my late 20’s, live and work in a city with a high stress job, and have little time to watch TV so I tend to not watch shows in real-time but wait for recommendations and then get them on Amazon. And I have seen very few zombie films/TV shows if any – It is not a genre I typically seek out. But wow – I feel head over heels for this show with Season 1 and have not been able to stop watching since.<br /><br />When I first heard the premise for the show – a group of survivors fighting to stay alive after the entire world has been consumed by a disease that reanimates the dead and causes them to become vicious, blood thirsty, zombies – I thought no way would I enjoy this. But after several friends kept pushing, I finally caved and watched.<br /><br />The show is of course violent and gory but all of that is really second to the characters themselves who make this show so amazing. The show makes you question values, human morals, and you find yourself rooting and cheering for these people through the screen.<br /><br />Season three is my favorite so far because we start to see that not only are the zombies a threat – the other humans can be an even worse threat. Rick and his group find shelter in a prison which adds an interesting dynamic. Two characters from season one return to stir the pot and a new character, Michonne, really adds to the group dynamic.",2015-08-27,1.0,True,1

Moving to more substantive matters, I think a real Christian [not the many people who claim God when doing so is convenient for them] would be offended by this movie. The message coming from this film seems to be “If you don’t believe in God, you’re a moron.”<br /><br />I cannot think of a more cruel message to send and actually undercuts the message of faith, hope, and love of all the Christians I know. That doesn’t mean that you love only those who share your worldview, but everyone regardless of where you find them in life. I actually hated the tone of the entire movie, in the first half, Christians are belittled for believing in God, and then it does this 180 and by the end, if you don’t believe in God, you’re severely lacking.<br /><br />Decisions about religious faith are very complex and personal things and it felt like this movie just trivialized that for really everybody.

There was some competent acting, and I read that getting the six episodes made was done in a big rush.  Did they have to use L.A. as the setting? Looking at the grime and remembering not being able to breathe there makes me sick; L.A. was a living Hell before the zombies.   I found myself browsing other sites while this pilot played in the background. When I watch TWD, I am glued to the screen.  Some additional points I am pondering:  I was focused on Frank Dillane's shirt being way to small for him and whether or not it was going to fall off, rather than the action. When I perused the episode a second time, I realized that it was maybe a size medium top made for girls, with a bit of lace or decoration around the collar, which was disorienting.  The mother says to the student found with a knife in his pocket, &#34;The authorities would let us know if anything were seriously wrong&#34;, or something naive and ignorant to that effect. Yet, in an interview about her character, the actress describes her as a &#34;badass&#34; and she comes across in the episode as a woman who would never believe that &#34;the authorities&#34; are to be trusted.  If ever you ever believe there might be blood, gore, and at least one murderer in an abandoned church which is a shooting gallery, be sure to go alone, without a weapon, and wait until it is dark to go in there.   How did they have electricity in the church? Was an addict together enough to wire it up?  If Gloria knew he was in the building, why didn't she go eat him? Did she turn and not recall that he was upstairs?  What hospital allows people who have two cracked rib and contusions and stay in the hospital? I live in California and I am always hearing stories about people being thrown out of hospitals the day after major surgeries. Even with a potential brain injury, they might have him report back as an outpatient.  I lived in L.A. for 18 years; I can think of two exits off of freeways that are from the left lane. Am I wrong?....so, after the traffic is at a standstill, miraculously, there is an exit forty feet away which is on the left.  The sister's boyfriend's timing in delivering of lines was poor, at one point, before he says, &#34;Exactly&#34;... in the exchange about UC Berkeley, and once again, I was reminded I was watching some poor directing.  If the drug dealer intended on killing the guy, why would he hold his pistol right by his side, in view of the intended victim?  After the drug dealer had turned, Mom and Dad just rush right up to him. Don't those people have any instincts? Opaque eyes are a clue something may be wrong.  What (ER) doctor is going to say to the mother's boyfriend, a man he has never seen before that moment, &#34;She's not listening&#34;?  What R.N. would be unconcerned about losing her job to the point that she would untie his wrist and leave the room?  I could go on and on, but I won't.",2015-08-27,0.6,False,0

and guilt, and a need to please the adults who are brainwashing them.<br />Teaching them to love Jesus might be a good thing, but teaching them that Satan is chasing them cannot be a good thing.<br /><br />It was heartbreaking to watch all of these children, crying and shouting, and talking about things that they were way too young to understand.<br /><br />The abortion scene really bothered me.<br />These children could not possibly really understand about abortion.<br />They only know what they are told, for example, by that man with the tiny plastic babies.<br />It always amazes me that the people who are most against abortion are men and old ladies, in other words, the people who cannot be faced with living through an unplanned pregnancy.<br /><br />Instead of that man with the tiny plastic babies, another preachy adult could have just as easily walked into that roomful of impressionable children and explained to them :<br />(1) about a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body, which according to the bible, is her temple,<br />(2) about ending a pregnancy because it puts the mother's life in danger,<br />(3) about how, in today's world, there are still women who die in childbirth,<br />(4) about ending a pregnancy of a baby that will be born with physical or mental problems,<br />(5) about a pregnancy of a teenager who will be abused by her family for getting pregnant out of wedlock, and how that baby will be treated,<br />(6) about a pregnancy of a girl so young that having a baby ruins her life,<br />(7) about a pregnancy of someone who will be abused by her boyfriend who does not want the responsibility of raising that baby, and about men who have actually murdered the pregnant women because they did not want the baby,<br />(8) about how a teenage boy's life is ruined because he will spend the next eighteen years paying child support, even if he never sees the child, andhow he can be taken to court and forced to get a paternity test, and how his salary can be garnished, and how the court can even force the teen boy's father to pay child support if the boy is too young to work, and how these religious families can force the boy to marry the pregnant girl, and how the teen couple who are not in love have to be in each other's lives forever because of the baby, and about broken hearts all the way around,<br />(9) about pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or child abuse or prostitution,<br />(10) about pregnancies of an alcoholic or a drug addict or someone with HIV or someone mentally ill or someone simply too sick to go through with a pregnancy or raising a child, and the possibilities of what these things will do to the health of the babies,<br />(11) about the child abuse and neglect of a child born to a mother and into family that did not want that baby or cannot afford to care for that baby,<br />(12) about a pregnant teen who is told by her family that she will be kicked out on the street if she has that illegitimate baby,<br />(13) about how this world is already overpopulated,<br />(14) about the economy and unemployment and homelessness and starving children, and about what it costs to raise a child to adulthood, such as the costs of diapers and college tuition and everything in between,<br />(15) about teen mothers raising children that they were not prepared for, and therefore resenting the child and the child eventually resenting the mother, and the cycle repeating itself so that that child also becomes a teen mother,<br />(16) about why God doesn't just stop abortion because God can do anything, or why God would allow an unwanted baby to be created while there are so many other women desperate to conceive who cannot,<br />(17) about unwanted pregnancies that result in the woman killing the baby as soon as he is born, or the woman committing suicide because of all of it,<br />(18) about how, if abortions were no longer legal, women would still get them, from unsafe unsanitary underground butchers, or trying it themselves with wire hangers or throwing themselves down the stairs, and getting infections or dying from it,<br />(19) about how there is no such thing as pro-abortion, it is simply pro-choice, because well thought out and researched decisions are what is necessary for the mother and the baby and the family and the world.<br /><br />If these children heard all of the details surrounding all of this, including these kinds of horrible stories that are on the news all of the time, then these children would probably be pro-choice, especially if these families taught them that pro-choice is the only way to believe and it is what Jesus wants, because children will believe anything that is drilled into them.<br /><br />Of course, these children could not understand all of this, and they shouldn't have to, because the topic of abortion is not appropriate for children.  These families should be teaching their children about abstinence and safe sex instead of discussing abortion.<br /><br />One of the little girls was actually preaching about how Jesus only goes into churches where people get up and shout instead of praying quietly.<br />But doesn't she believe that Jesus is everywhere and loves everyone, so how could he not be in every church and every place all of the time?<br />She was obviously repeating for the cameras the things that she hears at home constantly, and she had better agree with it all and believe it all, or else it will be hell in that home.<br /><br />Just like the other little girl who was talking about dancing and sins of the flesh, how could she understand the meaning of her own words.<br /><br />I was really surprised by the little girl who was bowling, actually asking Jesus to help her get a strike, just the powerful way that she was talking, I have heard many religious people talk like that, like Jesus should use his supernatural powers to help a little girl win a bowling game when there are children dying of diseases and crying out for relief of pain and a cure and a chance to live.<br /><br />These children are full of guilt and fear because they have been taught that every little thing is a sin and that they need to repent or they will go to hell.<br />What horrible sins could these children have committed to be sobbing and throwing themselves on the floor and begging for forgiveness?<br /><br />One little boy said that he was saved at the age of five, which is ridiculous because no five year old could understand what that means.<br /><br />Levi, the little boy who was preaching in front of all of the other children, really amazed me.<br />He obviously, like most of the children in this documentary, was drilled and brainwashed from birth.<br />I felt that he was preaching because he was aching for approval from the adults.<br />Would he preach so strongly if all of the adults left the room and only the children were listening?<br />Would all of those children behave differently if the adults left the room?<br /><br />One little boy was talking about how he found it difficult to believe in God because he cannot see him.<br />I think that he was mostly filled with fear of what would happen to him if he admitted to his family that he simply cannot believe.<br />The real hell for these children would be to live in a super religious home if they had the nerve to admit that they just do not believe, because these families will tell them that Satan has a hold on them and they will be punished constantly until they break down and say that they do believe.<br /><br />The woman who led the group, Becky Fisher, just made me shake my head.<br />I wondered if she had any children of her own.<br />Doesn't she know what the bible says about obesity?<br />When she is spraying a whole can of hairspray onto her head and then seeking compliments, isn't she aware of the sin of pride?<br /><br />Becky Fisher's speech about children dying for Jesus was inappropriate for children.<br />I wondered whether a child, already depressed and feeling unworthy because of sins, might actually commit suicide because of what she said, thinking of it as a holy sacrifice to definitely get into heaven, especially after always hearing about how heaven is such an amazing place while the world is such a horrible place.<br /><br />She was actually praying for the electricity to stay on because she believed that Satan could turn off the electricity.<br />She actually believed that and taught that to the children?<br />Someone should have reminded her that Jesus managed to preach without electricity.<br /><br />It is ridiculous to teach children that Harry Potter and ghost stories are sinful, and I have even heard of religions that do not allow any kind of fiction because it is &#34;lies.&#34;<br /><br />She actually walks through toy stores just to think up ways to brainwash gullible innocent children?<br /><br />She should be teaching these children how to put all of their religious energies into doing good deeds to help others and change the world in positive ways.<br />In other words, she should teach the children to &#34;do the Lord's work&#34; and use their imaginations to be creative in making the world a better place for the future.<br />Instead of approving of the children throwing themselves on the floor and sobbing, she could be getting them out in groups to do volunteer work for the community somehow, and do things that are good and positive and productive.<br />Instead, she is teaching them to be self-centered and self-absorbed and depressed by worrying about repenting for their tiniest sins with the goal of saving their own souls from hell, when she should be teaching them to be other-centered and love each other and look for the good inside of themselves and others, instead of focusing on all of the petty negatives.",2015-08-27,0.8888888888888888,True,1

This film relies mostly on dialogue and facial expression to build the tension and it does it to perfection. I loved the look and feel of this film which is very much a throwback to the 70s; the grainy look really works well here. Elisabeth Moss is absolutely mesmerizing in this film and at this moment is my choice for Best Lead Actress. The slow mental breakdown that Catherine is going through is rather chilling and Moss’s facial expressions alone tell a lot of the story.

Based on that alone we can already guess as to what the story might be, which would've been fine had it been as simple and straight forward as the title suggests. This marks the feature film directorial debut for photographer Tyler Shields, who has apparently also dabbled in music videos. I've never heard of the guy until this project was announced years back, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. Sadly it's clear that putting it in the hands of an artsy photographer and combining it with a bad script turned what could've been a potentially decent slasher into a boring, nonsensical semi-revenge thriller.<br /><br />The ridiculous story starts off with a character named William (Wes Bentley) interviewing a little girl named Veronica in an old dirty room (that doesn't seem shady at all). Her parents just died (they never say how, nor does she seem to care) and he asks her a series of questions, eventually coming to the conclusion that she's the type of person he's looking for. He tells her that he has a very important job for her, and with the promise of ice cream, she gladly accepts (entering super creeper territory now).<br /><br />Jump to 12 years later and it turns out that William was only looking to turn the little girl into a killing machine (*whew*); training and preparing her for all sorts of physical encounters. Up until now Veronica was merely luring creepy old men and teaching them a lesson, but for her final test she will have to take on a group of young serial killers that prey on innocent women (specifically blondes).<br /><br />Judging from my brief description of the film's plot you can gather that very little in the story makes any kind of sense and many things are simply never explained. Aside from all the plot-holes it takes almost an hour before we get to the good stuff. Before that they just go back and forth with training flashbacks and dull dialogue-filled scenes. Once the action does finally start there's absolutely no gore and barely even any blood. Even an axe to the chest results to nothing since it's so dark.<br /><br />And I personally don't have anything against actress Abigail Breslin, but she was terribly miscast as Veronica. It's just hard to believe that little Abigail can easily manhandle all these dudes that are much larger than her. Not to mention she looked awkward in all her fight scenes, which is an obvious indication that she didn't undergo any sort of actual physical training before filming and if she did it definitely wasn't enough. Though, I'll say that the movie was well shot and had a nice look to it at times, but that's about all the good I can say about it.<br /><br />Overall Final Girl is a little too dull, nonsensical, and artsy for its own good. The story doesn't make any sense and there's no satisfying deaths or gore to fall back on. I'd recommend skipping this one.n hour before we get to the good stuff.

The parents are so far up in the clouds their expectations cannot possibly be met, nothing in this film warrants a rated 'R' rating; this movie primarily revolves around high school seniors in modern times, of course there WILL be references to porn and sex. Fans of original books tend to never be satisfied no matter the genre, most often rightfully so, but at the same time who doesn't know that already? A movie isn't going to be as detailed as a fleshed out novel. Anyway, I digress.<br /><br />The movie itself, is okay, nothing special in the least. This is your typical high school feel-good Hollywood movie. What I liked the most is the small role of Bianca's mother, Dottie (Allison Janney) who is a self-help guru filled with one-liners while randomly passing by instead of actually giving motherly advice which is what Bianca is yearning for. The very small but hilarious role of Principal Buchanan (Romany Malco from \\""Weeds\\"") was the best, I rewound one of his scenes twice it was so funny!! I watched this movie for free on YouTube, for some unknown reason it was one of my auto suggestions for the night. Unless you're able to obtain a copy or stream for free this is not a movie I would recommend wasting money on; just wait until it's available for Amazon Prime, and if it never goes to Prime, you're really not missing anything.<br /><br />I will admit it was not a complete bore, Mr. Malco was hilarious, and the ultimate love interest was easy on the eyes. However, I inherently have issues with these Hollywood teen girl movies. Mind you, I have not read the novel this movie is based upon, but \\""The Duff\\"" is nothing new; it's essentially an ugly-duckling make-over teen flick. If these movies are truly supposed to be empowering and feel-good types of flicks, then why is the make-over and eye candy necessary? Can the end goal be something other than a boyfriend? Can self-esteem be based upon something more then the superficial things such as popularity, makeup, and clothes? And in the case of \\""The Duff\\"", Bianca was a-okay until someone referred to her as a \\""Duff\\"" and then by the end of the movie; thanks to the make-over, of course, she magically realized she had a crush on her next door neighbor subconsciously and didn't know it and enjoyed the new pretty clothes and makeup because she had never tried it.

Ridiculous show.,"This comes off as someone completely clueles iss about surf culture trying to make a buck by cashing in on the popularity of the surf culture.  People who live it, know this is crap. Less intelligent people who don't know the culture, might believe we are all this moronic. I don't know, the books these are based on (I haven't read) may be much, much better than the scripts here.  This is not creatively quirky, this is not &#34;new or fresh&#34;. This show is trying toooooo hard.  Yes, I suffered through the entire thing.  Perversely, I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen. There are only two or three characters who don't cuss with every other word and it's mostly the f-word and various sex acts as cuss words. Hey, I can swear like a sailor, but this was just stupid. It reminds me of kids in school who try to beef out an essay requiring a specific number of words, only this time it was ridiculous profanity. I don't mind it when it's a legitimate part of REAL LIFE conversation, but it seems that the people are all cretins who aren't bright and have extremely limited vocabulary.  Most every character (save three) is exaggerated and completely over the top unbelievable.  The BEST part of this series are the opening shots.  Seriously.  What I liked about this series:  Luis Guzman was the only character whose script gave him something to work with even though it wasn't a lot, some really good scenes with very few clunkers. His natural ability here could have been in any reputable, solid piece and in fact, he's had some great roles. The kid who played Shaun may not be an actor, but for the part, it worked. His sparse dialogue makes the character seem like an old soul, he was likeable.  Ed O'Neill was as good as he could be under the circumstances.  More dislikes:  As fine looking as he is and as good an actor as he is, Bruce Greenwood's character was meh, but not as bad Rebecca de Mornay's character who had ZERO redeeming qualities - she needed serious medication. You could see the white around her eyes in every shot - seriously hyperbitch ready to f-this and that and go Tasmanian Devil on people. Needed a straight jacket.

I still haven't watched the two prequels but I will now because I loved this film so very much.<br />This is a movie about life as it happens after years of marriage, it would help if you have seen the other installments but I enjoyed this as a stand alone. We get to know the lovers ( Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) as a married couple of many years. Now on holiday in Greece with their two daughters. As the summer nears its end, Hank is sad as he just had to send his son away on to Chicago back to his ex wife. He is worried that he won't be able to be a part of his growing son as he wants and that he will miss out on the most important years.  The conversation in the car as it drives down the countryside to a dinner date is a single long take and it is important that you listen to the seemingly small talk and chatter because a lot of things are revealed about the past lives of the occupants. The single take shots are amazing and are used throughout the movie whether they are in the car, at the dinner table, in the hotel room fighting accusing each other.<br />I can't even do justice to this film through this brief review because the movie is made up of so many deep layers.

This was such a great watch.  It was fairly upbeat, which is something I appreciated a lot.

So I was happy that they didn't focus too much on his drug abuse, they touch on it, but it's not the focus.  What I loved most about this was that you can tell that the people they interviewed genuinely love and deeply miss Chris Farley still to this day.  There are some great comedians in this talking about Chris like he was head and shoulders above them when it came to talent.  I've long considered Farley to be the funniest person I've ever seen, so it was nice to hear such prominent figures in the comedy world agree.  It was pretty cool to learn that one of his movies was very closely related to his life, something I was not aware of.  There is some footage of his early days that I had never seen before, as well as come really cool pictures of Chris.  If you enjoy Chris Farley at all, this is a must watch for you.<br /><br />I'd guarantee you wouldn't be disappointed, but how do you know I'm not some crazy glue sniffer? &#34;Building model airplanes&#34; says the little commenter ; well, we're not buying it.

So I was very happy to see that a series was being made. Though also a bit worried as it is tough to put everything that a book holds into a movie/series. I thought I was buying Season 1, turned out to be half of Season 1. I did not pay for the HD version as I was not sure that I would like it or not. The standard version was fuzzy and appeared to be downgraded. It appears that the person who cast the actors did not read the books, or perhaps there just was not anyone who fit the part of Jamie?  I am disappointed that the author agreed on the actor who plays Jamie (And I know from other reviews that I am not alone.). The actors who play Claire and Jamie are good, but the chemistry that is supposed to be between them is missing. Maybe some of the fiery looks that should be exchanged between them were edited out?  Jaime is supposed to be a tall red haired warrior and I apparently cannot get over the fact that the actor who plays him is not. But it seems one is always disappointed in something when a book is made into a movie. Nothing can match our imaginations.

In this movie, I had no idea where it was going.  It is a long movie and it is not obvious that they are going to space for some time (too long actually).  Eventually it picks up and they get into space where most of the action takes place.  I have been so very disappointing with a lot of sci-fi movies that this rates well just because they appeared to try hard, and they were able to not actually screw it up.  Of course it will never be perfect because you are suspending reality.  In a general sense it reminded me of Contact with Jody Foster (that interestingly had Matthew McConaughey as well).  It had a similar feel with sci-fi mixed with a little para-normal.  It has a twist at the end the I liked.  To me the main dilemma was... would you leave your family to save humanity?

As such, it might be considered an update of &#34;AN UNMARRIED WOMAN&#34; in which Jill Clayburgh ran this gamut back in 1978.  Patricia Clarkson and Sir Ben Kingsley are marvelous in their respective roles as a professional book critic devastated by her husband's abandonment and an Indian Sikh driving instructor who values his culture at the expense of his career and embarks on an arranged marriage with a stranger shipped to him from India.  Samantha Bee is hilarious as Clarkson's cynical but loving sister, and Grace Gummer is poignant and engaging as Clarkson's college-age daughter going through romantic throes of her own.  The topicality of the film, which is produced, directed, edited and scripted by women, is reflected in the racial and ethnic slurs that Kingleys's character, a highly educated former political prisoner in his homeland, faces on the streets of New York daily, and in the INS raids on his apartment where he shelters others who are undocumented fleeing persecution in India.  A fresh twist on the obligatory bedroom scene in which Clarkson's character reluctantly takes a lover has her date practicing tantric sex with her.  Men in movies seem to be studs or duds, as if male sexuality only has two gears--fifth or park.  Regardless of how the viewer might react to the male character--who is not a bad sort as midlife professional urban white males go--this amusing, intriguing scene depicts male heterosexuality in a much wider and truer reality.  Brava!  A note on renowned Thelma Schoonmaker's work here (with Keith Reamer):  constant quick and abrupt cuts between the very disparate lives of Kingley's and Clarkson's characters create a sense of the story taking place in real time and a spiritual connection between the characters even when they are far apart and dealing with completely different life situations.  Also kudos to Dania Saragovia for her realistic settings that range from the claustrophobic (when we're in the car on New York's crowded streets for the driving lessons) to the contrast in the living environments of the characters (Clarkson's empty house vs. Kingsley's jam-packed apartment) to the gorgeousness of the Sikh temple.",2015-08-22,1.0,True,1

The acting was decent considering the financial resources available, i.e., I wasn't expecting A-list talent and I thought the cast did a respectable job.

Trimming the fat would have made this a sleek 15 minute fast-paced short. The whole backstory of the characters revealed through the long dialogue scenes did nothing to make me feel sympathetic towards the characters. Anyway, the second half was cool and very action-oriented and as the credits rolled I thoroughly enjoyed where the film took me.

Old cable &#34;Bro Show&#34; where one of the two goes on to host a late night show while the other is stuck having to tour doing comedy for small crowds and smaller checks. But Jimmy Kimmel makes me laugh and Carolla barely did in this film.<br /><br />The cameos are fun but the ending is pretty unbelievable. It was pretty well obvious where it was going and, while sweet, doesn't seem very realistic. Especially since the entire movie seems like it's written from a very bitter POV.<br /><br />Lastly, this was one of the only Prime movies I've watched on my smart TV, but the video quality was really bad. I can't tell if it's an issue with the way they shot this on a low budget or a problem inherent in Prime. Based on other reviews, I'm guessing it's the best this crowdfunded movie could do. In the end, I feel like I should have watched the Veronica Mars movie I got on DVD for crowdfunding that instead...",2015-08-28,1.0,True,0

Due to Miranda's frenetic schedule, Andrea was importuned with myriad requests. Andrea had recently graduated from Northwestern University in Chicago. She, her boyfriend, and another couple moved to Manhattan. She wanted to be a journalist for a magazine publisher such as The New Yorker or Vanity Fair. Her taste in raiment and dishabille dress was deemed by her new employer and associates as banal and atrocious. She painstakingly jumped through hoops to get the fastidious Miranda's approval, and she completely updated her wardrobe (Dior dress, Chanel jacket and belt, Hemes bag, and Vivier shoes) and dropped from a size 6 to a dainty size 4.

If you want more factual information, see David Attenborough's film on Madagascar.  I have also been to Ranomafana, where Patricia Wright works, and while her park is really well-constructed, it is really not having good effects on the villagers living nearby.  Ask them how they feel about the creation of the park ten years ago, and you get lots of shifty looks and even shiftier answers.  The people are being negatively impacted by the influx of foreign tourists, and while the park guides are the highest-paid in Madagascar, the rest of the people are becoming poorer, creating huge class differences and thus animosity between different classes.  Her research center is truly state-of-the-art, with lots of great equipment.  However, it also has entire closets full of pillows and really fancy showers, too (I didn't even use a pillow the entire time I was in Madagascar; so few citizens have them, and I only ever took bucket baths, which is all that most people have access to), creating even larger divides between those who work in the park and those forced to live on the margins.  Additionally at the end of the film it shows Patricia Wright petting and interacting with lemurs in the wild.  This is bad for the lemurs because it lessens their fear of humans, making them easier targets for bushmeat hunters and making them less likely to run during slash-and-burn events in their forests.  Patricia Wright's story might be a good one from a conservation perspective, but it is a sad one from a social perspective, and if conservation is going to be truly lasting, it needs to benefit both the environment and the local people in order for them to feel like they should invest in conservation strategies.",2015-08-24,0.6666666666666666,False,0

I'm a Christian of very traditional faith, but I've developed a real wariness of Christian-produced documentaries in regard to  history and archeology.  My university education was in history, logic, and debate, so a good deal of my training was in how to spot logical or evidentiary holes in an argument.  Unfortunately, many Christian documentaries contain huge skip-overs of contrary historical and archeological evidence in pursuit of a predetermined conclusion -- a highly selective &#34;pick-and choose&#34; consideration of the evidence.  In logic, this is known as a circular argument.  It assumes as a given (that the Bible is historically factual) the very thing that is to be proved (that the Bible is historically factual).  If you start from that assumption, then naturally you're going to present only the evidence that supports what you have assumed as a given.  The premise predetermines the conclusion.  That is circular reasoning.  This documentary is unique in two respects: 1) It starts from a relatively neutral point of view and gives respectful hearing to roughly equivalent numbers of both skeptics and proponents of Biblical historicity.  2) It shows that the current mainstream view of archeologists and Egytologists in regard to the the Exodus account is entirely predicated on the given assumption that the story must be dated to the reign of Ramesses II in the Late Kingdom, around 1250 BC, in which there is no historical or archeological evidence for the Exodus.  But if the timeline is shifted about two centuries earlier, around 1450 BC under under the reign of Thotmose II or Thotmose II (and the mother-regent Hapshetsut) during the Middle Kingdom, there is ample historical and archeological evidence that does fit with the Exodus story.  So in effect, the majority of ancient historians and Egyptologists have engaged in a huge circular argument of their own: The roughly 1250 BC dating of the Exodus account is a given, a fixedfact, with no real accounting for the historical/archeological evidence for an earlier date of around 1450 BC.  Again, the premise predetermines the conclusion.  Circular reasoning.  No historical/acheological scholar approaches the research without personal biases or predispositions of his own, which highly colors how he interprets the evidence.  But this documentary comes closer than any I've seen at adopting a fairly neutral starting point, giving fair hearing to both pro an con positions, and then simply following the evidence where it leads.",2015-08-25,0.8461538461538461,True,1

How they got her to agree to be interviewed, I don't know, but it says something about the producers that they were able to accomplish this.<br /><br />We've all seen Mr. Strand's photos, so I think the whole point in watching a movie about him is to learn more about him and his life.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought the (quite brief, actually) segment about his career in film making was slow, as my impression was quite the opposite, and since this is a documentary film and Mr. Strand spent many years as a movie cameraman it's completely logical that this would also be a part of the film, not just his still photography. I thought this segment was very interesting, especially to see his film making style, which reminded me of Sergei Eisenstein's, and which we probably won't see anywhere else, and to learn that he was taking on very serious subjects such as racial intolerance, the KKK, and McCarthyism. Also that his decision to move to Europe was largely because of these issues.<br /><br />Seeing Mr. Strand wielding his monstrously huge Graflex SLR (5x7?) was also a highlight.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack was nothing special, kind of typical of a low budget documentary, but I wasn't watching the movie to listen to the music. The &#34;Ken Burns&#34; style of showing the photos was the weakest and most distracting part of the film for me. I felt that the film makers should have displayed the photos in full view first, and then panned around if they felt the need to push that button on iMovie. If the rest of the film had not been so informative I would have knocked a star off for this, but there was so much else about it that was really good that I kept it at five.<br /><br />I was not surprised at the end to learn from the credits that this film was funded by the Canadian National Film Board. I have watched numerous documentaries funded by this agency, and they have all been of high quality. One can also go to their website and watch a lot of movies for free.

Cait's biting and insinuating comment in the first episode (while on the bus to SF) about how many people in the LGBT community (specifically transgender folks) would rather live on the system as oppose to work because its easier, is appalling and nauseating. Several episodes later referring to the LGBT community as &#34;Them&#34; and &#34;They&#34; is mind boggling, and shows how disconnected she is in her unwillingness to be associated with folks that she is clearly uncomfortable to be around. She learns not by literally going on the streets and seeing how people in the LGBT community have to make a living, but by bringing people to her luxury ocean front Malibu home and to a high end Napa Valley villas to discuss issues. Or she offers to pick up the bill to make a difference in someones life. What a privileged thing to do--throw money at it! REALLY? Its not about money or tossing it around. Its about spending time, caring, really listening (over a long period of time) and developing a new sense of community and larger family unit.  With all due respect Cait, its time to leave your comfort zone and PRIVILEGED PLANTATION! Time to &#34;pick a team&#34;, leave OZ, and see how average folks live, work, advocate, and survive day to day in the LGBT community. Its clear she doesn't understand the struggles many have faced and the insurmountable odds some have overcome to just survive day to day. In my humble opinion, Cait has brought some things to light, GREAT, KUDOS TO HER, but the African American woman, Blossom, who was continually denied entry into nursing school for being transgender, fights obstacles daily to survive, and still has a &#34;I will persevere&#34; attitude is the real ESPY award winner, along with the academics and activists on the show that have been fighting a lifetime for rights and to be heard. Those are the real heroes/heroines of the LGBT community, not someone walking in in the last 30 seconds and stealing the limelight. What happened to self-deprecation and saying: NO, and literally deferring to others who have been fighting a lifetime and are unheard!?! Where is the humility?! Clearly something is amiss!

Eddie Marsan is perfect as John May, a little man whose job it is to find the families of people who have died alone.  Just as he is handed a new case, he is informed that his department is being merged with another, and May is to be laid off.  He is given enough time to finish the latest case.<br /><br />The movie progresses at its own pace - certain to be boring for people who are addicted to the typical fast-paced action film - and is very understated.  One gets the feeling that one is attending a funeral ... which, in a way, one is.  Marsen, again, is perfect for this role.  He is slow (one of the reasons he's being let go from his job), apparently unemotional (Marsen maintains the same neutral appearance almost completely throughout the film) and totally understates his performance.  You genuinely feel sorry for this little man who seems to be going through life without being noticed (at one point, going home after work) he walks between two men who are having an animated conversation in the hallway; he never makes notice of the two men, and they never take notice of him - as if he wasn't even there.<br /><br />The movie is rich with (again, understated) symbolism.  It's there - but you have to look for, and attend to, it.  The direction is excellent; the camera work is perfect, continually giving us a small, uninteresting, picture of a life playing out (almost could be considered claustrophobic, since there is usually no one in the scene but Marsen and the one or two people he's interacting with - and most of the time he is alone).  The soundtrack (what there is of it) is fantastic.<br /><br />On the whole, you are given a plain, slow, empty film that magnificently portrays a plain, slow, empty life.  If you believe that movies can be art, that they can be more than the slap-dashed product of fast action, loud noises, hyperactive people, this movie is for you.  I seriously mean it  when I say that this may be the best movie I have ever seen, in terms of being a film that sets its sight on a goal, finds the perfect way to reach that goal, and diligently applies itself to achieving that goal - and achieves it with magnificent effect.ean it  when I say that this may be the best movie I have ever seen, in terms of being a film that sets its sight on a goal, finds the perfect way to reach that goal, and diligently applies itself to achieving that goal - and achieves it with magnificent effect.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,1

It asks 'if then'? What if socialists win elections across the globe? What if Donald Trump wins in 2016, and is such an amazing leader, him and his brand of leadership serve as a guide for our nation, or perhaps the world, for generations to come? Just as often as it asks, 'if then', it asks, 'what if'? What if energy becomes completely free? What if cloning humans becomes as prevalent a trip to the local doctor? Many might recognize Sci Fi in it's creation of imaginary worlds that ask us to look upon our own world right now, presented in a different perspective, sometimes criticizing current society, or instead, some members in it.<br /><br />There were early or proto 'sci-fi' stories written as long ago as 2,000 years ago but it's been said science fiction as we know it didn't really (and couldn't really) exist until the 1900's when we became more aware of the larger world around us. It's a menace, a threat, a disease, or an ideology that threatens us all. After watching Battleship, I can't help but wonder if characters in the story have to save the whole world in order for it to Science fiction.<br /><br />Do the characters in Battleship save the world? With the speed in which aliens send five space ships to Earth after receiving a radio message from Earth, covering at bare minimum 10 light years distance, and their amazing ability to put up an energy shield covering all of Hawaii and a larger portion of ocean, it is a real question as to whether or not they'd send even more ships? The mystery of their other ships disappearance might mean something to them. Perhaps, though, for whatever reason, our navies did save the Earth.<br /><br />There's some question throughout the film whether or not the aliens are truly hostile, or whether they are merely trying to protect themselves and their mission as the film unwinds (although admittedly over reacting to us Earthlings - or did they under react to the threat we pose)?Quite often they let Earthlings go or be on their way if they do not consider them a threat. Are they going to eliminate or subjugate them later? Who knows, but why take any chances? One of the more interesting scenes in the film is shown from the perspective of one of the alien soldiers. It seems to be a memory or a flashback. We see him and his race at war with and being attacked by another alien race.<br /><br />The escalation to war, or at least fighting, is held out to be a metaphor for a fight between an American navy captain (the lead in the film) and his Korean rival. Our navy captain is punished quite severely for participating in the fight. It's an open question in the mind of the viewer through much of the film - is he being punished so hard because his opponent is Korean, or Asian? Throughout the film, especially the later parts, I couldn't help but see pop singer Rihanna, the female lead, in the role of mate to many of the different male characters (especially the extra pale guy with the buzz cut that often behaved kind of stupidly). The 'shells' being loaded and fired became quite interesting. I don't know what it was. It was a very intense movie. We can always hope they achieve contact. Battleship couldn't have been made without an interracial cast. Or at least it wouldn't have been as interesting - having only the action on screen to interest us.<br /><br />Overall it was a very entertaining film. Overall the plot made a lot of sense. Our victory over much more powerful aliens made a bit less sense. There were some breaks in the action, or explanations that went missing in the film (at what point did night fall and the Aliens somehow lose track of them)?  Battleship may have been cut or reduced in length. If so the film suffered a little bit because of it. Over all the film makes more sense if you consider that the aliens might not be completely hostile, or again, if they don't see us as much of an immediate threat to their selfish plans.<br /><br />One thing is certain, never send out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.nd out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say &#34;emotionally charged love triangle&#34; which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.<br /><br />The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees &#34;A is for Adam.&#34; One would conclude what &#34;Z&#34; would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.<br /><br />The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it.

Battle on Shangganling Mountain is a good example of a vintage Chinese propaganda movie. This film, though disguised to entertain the Chinese masses, aimed at the education of the viewing masses. The ideal-communist’s persona was portrayed in a rather clumsy, sophomoric manner. Yet in the years the film was made China was very much a raw, sprawling society. Very much yet to recover from World War Two and return to a normal state after the Communist revolution. Chalk it up to how primitive the Chinese film industry was made in the 1950s. Production value of the film as well the cheese acting both resemble acting styles and the film-production value of American (Grade-B) films in the 1930s. Film and the speeds at which it was run allows blurring of a moving image, such as a moving soldier. Even sitting on its tripod  camera movement is jerky. Most likely a trusted member of the Communist Party was present during the movie’s filming to assure the artistic expression conforms to Chinese, Communists political correctness. If there was not that than the director would have to have been a trusted member of the Communist Party. Here in this film is seen how politico-social ideology influences artistic expression.  For example notice, occurring a few times, how the camera pans across a line-up of Chinese soldiers’ faces. Than notice ever present willingness among soldiers to demonstrate selfless sacrifice. Some scenes seem to be randomly edited to others. Never figured what was going on with that. Another thing, is it's interesting to view was movies showing US as the enemy. To see how the US persona is perceived by other cultures opens the mind. And how US troops were portrayed in their attack of the mountain as one moving mass resembling an unrelenting swarm of ants more accurately illustrates how Chinese soldiers attached US military positions.",2015-08-29,1.0,True,1

The great Don Cheadle as a totally bada$$ MF.  Ving Rhames as an accomplice with an intriguing side story about family loyalty and guilt, and Steve Zahn as the kind of loose cannon low life that he does so well.  And at the center of it all, the great chemistry of Clooney and Lopez.  Clooney is his usual charming rogue self (comparing not unfavorably to Cary Grant in his charisma), but the revelation is Jennifer Lopez as a tough chick US Marshal who tends to look for love in all the wrong places.

On the one hand, it's got some very interesting stories that are spooky when you place yourself into the place of the people who experienced them. The whole gas lamp guy and long-haired blonde lady stories especially spooked me out. So good there.<br /><br />But this documentary had some serious editing issues. Other reviewers have made note, but I just gotta put my two cents in. The sound editing! Oy vey.... There are parts of this where the music is too loud, to the point of drowning out the narrators and speakers. And for a documentary that relies so much on oral stories, that's a tragedy.<br /><br />Also, some of the evidence and points the documentary put forward I've got to question. The whole sound guy part made me rolling my eyes. He never seemed to really come to a point and the points he did come to seemed to have no relevance to the REST of the documentary. Also, the whole man in the electric chair.... My mind was coming up with multiple explanations for that one. Commercial poster on the wall behind the train? One of those transparent commercial window coverings (think they had those in the 80s). Being just like the display in the wax museum is very suspicious.<br /><br />So interesting to a point with some good creepy, oral stories.

Murnau, cinematographer Karl Freund and actor Emil Jannings combined to make a stunning film which pushed film technique and composition to new heights. Many cite this film as an example of German Expressionism, but there is absolutely no support for that designation.<br /><br />The film excels in its realism. The few expressionistic elements are occasional moments of drunken revelry which are purely subjective to the characters in the film. It is these moments, along with the famous &#34;happy ending&#34; which make the film such a wonderful example of story construction and audience manipulation in that they exist inside the context of a hyper-realistic world not a strangely expressionistic one.<br /><br />The story is of an old man, a proud doorman of a luxury hotel. His identity is completely wrapped up in his work. When his duties are taken away from him because of age and frailty, he is sent to become the attendant of the basement men's room. There he begins a rapid decent into degradation and shame.<br /><br />Murnau's use of light and shadow serves to isolate the old man who progressively, physically breaks down into complete decay. The exaggerated acting conventions of silent cinema carried out masterfully by Emil Jannings, create a heart-breaking cinematic experience.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of the tragic ending of the story and the comedic epilogue was unprecedented in cinema. The contrast created between the two different parts of the story is almost surreal and certainly jarring. Murnau clearly understands the power he has over an audience as a filmmaker, and he uses that power in a god-like way, to twist their reactions and their emotions.<br /><br />The viewer is left to wonder whether the film ends in a cold, cynical dream much like Winston Smith slips into before his ultimate and most horrible torture in Orwell's &#34;1984,&#34; or is it a pleasant Disney-esque deus-ex-machina happy ending? This innovative style of story telling has been copied by several modern filmmakers.

Though there are a few scenes where the characters yell at each other.<br /><br />Jack Black uses his timing, facial contortions, amazing singing voice,  and adopted accent to really be the star of the show.<br /><br />The writing surpasses most  formula comedies in that so many less-than-high-frequency-words are used.

I remember visiting his website some 15 years ago, and even back then, it was good, honest reporting, without the sensationalism found everywhere else. That said, this film (if you can call it that) is SIRIUS-ly flawed, and quite frankly, somewhat embarrassing<br /><br />It starts with a title sequence that is concerned more with the architecture of buildings that do nothing to set up the story or introduce characters, etc. Remember, movies are first and foremost storytelling, and whether the audience knows something about the subject matter or not, it is important to create a narrative (even in a documentary) that gives the viewer a complete understanding of the circumstances, events, people, places and things.<br /><br />Next, the use of parallel editing, where several story lines are advanced simultaneously, is a convention used in many films, and it can be a dramatic and effective one at that. However, the editing here is disjointed and even confusing at times. Again, if you know the background, you can fill in the blanks (which some of the reviewers here use to defend the movie); but for those seeing this information or hearing these testimonies for the first time, it lacks coherence.<br /><br />Regarding the little creature... while this is a most fascinating discovery, the idea that it is built up throughout the film, only to have the results be inconclusive at the end, is a major cinematic let down. There is no discussion of the many small craft sightings, that could put the size of this potential alien into perspective; nor any discussion of the fairy lore or other mythical and historical sightings that some have suggested could be of extraterrestrial origin -- which is an interesting hypothesis I might add -- and a missed filmic opportunity.<br /><br />As far as the various montagesof images and brief testimonies of ex-military witnesses, while this was good stuff, it seems that the editor could have spent at least a few more weeks, picking and choosing and cutting and ordering the shots.<br /><br />While the whole military industrial complex theme is an important one to explain the reason for the cover up of technology, the tie in with September 11th seemed to take something away from the very serious topic of the military stealing energy patents, etc. The 9-11 conspiracy thing has been dealt with in countless documentaries, and to just mention it in passing, seemed out of place -- however important to the overall story it may have been.<br /><br />It seems to me that they either ran out of money (and time) and rushed together the final cut; or worse, the filmmakers deliberately sabotaged Greer's story.<br /><br />With all of the hype leading up to this film and the disclosure, the film was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd like to see this re-made as soon as possible. Oh, and one more thing... I'm assuming using Sirius has to do with alien visitors coming from that star system, but I can't recall a single mention of it.",2015-08-25,0.7272727272727273,False,0

It is neither surprising nor unexpected (I realize that statement is redundant, but I am trying to keep things at my brother's level).  Despite its predictability, however, it was very well done.  And Kevin Bacon gets to play a character who is simultaneously a sociopath and a buffoon on the level of Leslie Nielsen (Leslie Nielsen is a guy who was in Airplane the Movie and the Naked Gun films, which people my age and my twin brother's age still consider funny...my twin brother and I are the same age).  Bacon spends a good deal of the movie either terrorizing the two young boys who have stolen his cop car, or freaking out about how he could possibly be so stupid as to let his cop car be stolen.  He also kills people.  So there's that.<br /><br />Long and short: it is a slow, predictable burn, but worth the watch.",2015-08-28,0.6666666666666666,False,0

Push, Texas Ranger. The plots are interesting enough but soon become templated, especially after Allison (Patricia Arquette) becomes a more or less regular employee of the Phoenix DA's office. Rather than developing a rhythm (as the &#34;Mentalist&#34; did), the scripts adapt a regularity with frequent and unnecessary dives to the left with the monotonous and cacophonous domestic backstory. Backstories do add depth and complexity into character and plot development (such as, the great series &#34;Toma&#34;) but here are largely extraneous and repetitive, dumbing out the rest of the episode. Altogether, the lack of the scripts to sustain suspense and the listless sidetracks into domesticity make it  increasingly difficult for Patricia Arquette to carry the series. And I've only seen year 1 (on Amazon Instant Prime in binge mode). Maybe this works better week-to-week but I doubt it.<br /><br />At this point it must be noted the series lasted 7 seasons.

So...how about the rest of the movie?","This is one I’ve been hearing about for years. Probably since it came out, I’d been hearing a lot of things about Irreversible, mainly for “THE SCENE”. Since you’re looking through reviews for this movie, there’s a 99% chance you know exactly what I’m talking about. Irreversible was in my queue for a couple of years. It took me a long time to get around to it because I didn’t want to watch it on a night when I was in a really good mood, or when I was down for whatever reason. I wanted to be neutral and pretty awake. I stayed away from any kind of long plot summary, and only knew that this was a revenge movie, supposedly one of the most brutal ones out there. I can see how that would’ve been the case when the movie came out, and as a result, I think this is one better left to people who haven’t seen many brutal revenge movies. Had I watched Irreversible the year it came out, or even not too long after, I’d probably appreciate it more.<br /><br />After a long, annoying, opening credits that starts to spin to get you a feeling for the tone of the movie (seriously, just jump ahead 3 minutes or so to avoid this), we’re introduced to two older men on a bed in a small room, just having a small conversation. It turns out that one of them slept with his own daughter. They then hear a ruckus outside, and we’re taken to the aftermath of a horrible scene at a bar, with a man being put into an ambulance on a stretcher. Another man is leaving in handcuffs, seemingly aware of what he did and what’s going to happen to him. Cut to right before that and it’s clear that the movie is going in reverse. We see the man who was in the ambulance, and the one being arrested, storming the bar looking for someone. One of them, Pierre, is hesitant to do anything and the other, Marcus, looks like he’s ready to kill whoever prevents him from finding the man. Eventually, Marcus does find him, and it doesn’t go his way- he ends up on the floor in no time and gets his arm broken. Pierre steps in, knocks the dude aside, and proceeds to smash the heck out of his head with a fire extinguisher, rendering it into a literal bloody pulp. It ain’t pretty. From here, we go back to find out what led them to this gruesome act of violence.<br /><br />I know people are going to take one look at my rating and then vote on it being not “helpful”, because for some reason a lot of people who read reviews have already dealt with whatever the product is, and just want to make sure others agree with them. I “get” this movie. I get why the camera spins and moves around so much for the first third of the movie, ok? I get that one of the main points in the movie, when all’s said and done, is to show that our actions are irreversible, and that nothing good ever comes from revenge. That being said, I was bored from beginning to end. So much in this film feels like it’s trying to be unique that by the time “THE SCENE” happened, I was bored and waiting for it to be over with and see what happened prior to that part. That scene goes on for several minutes, and I’m sure I’m going to get heat for this part especially, but it didn’t make me feel anything. It’s the first time we really see Monica Bellucci’s character, Alex, so for all we know, this is a complete stranger that it’s happening to, and we have zero connection to her. Of course it’s still a terrible thing that’s happening, but it’s equal to when some no name character in a movie gets murdered, at least to me it is. Apart from the fire extinguisher smashing, there wasn’t anything here that seemed all that brutal to me. In fact, compared to a few other movies I’ve seen (all of varying quality), the violence and sex scenes here are pretty average.<br /><br />If there’s anything I liked, it’s that I appreciated that each segment was seemingly done in one take. There are never cuts to show closeup reactions or to transition from scene to scene. The camera follows the stars wherever they are, and only moves along to another ‘angle’ when we go to an earlier part of the day. Also, by the end (well, beginning I guess) of the movie, I finally kind of liked Marcus, because his scene with Alex when they’re just in bed waking up made them seem like a real couple. The way they interacted with each other was very believable, and they looked like two people in love. Sure enough, I checked Vincent Cassel’s bio and him and Monica were married! I was gonna say, with some of the areas he got to put his face in, she must’ve been at least dating him at that time, or Monica is just that carefree when it comes to nakedness in movies!<br /><br />As bored as I was, for the most part, the movie still has an interesting enough main plot of Marcus and Pierre finding the criminal that kept me from turning it off. A lot of the segments feel too long, especially the one on the subway, and some viewers may be turned off by the filming style used for the first section of the movie since it goes along with the downward spiral into madness and being on drugs. I don’t recommend it as something you should see, but at the same time, you may as well watch it just so you can say you saw it.",2015-08-27,1.0,True,0

The story is at times rushed and nonsensical, and the characters come off as underdeveloped, but it's nice to see a sincere attempt at a bittersweet, original story to contrast with Disney's formulaic, royalty-obsessed drivel.  The Studio Ghibli influence is strong, and the film does little to hide the obvious fact that many Ghibli films had been directly drawn from for inspiration, particularly Ponyo (which was pretty much the source of the story - both films center around a house on a cliff by the sea and a magical girl whose mother is a kind of goddess), but also Spirited Away (lending the witch Yubaba in the form of Maca, with her large-headed bird-like appearance and avian lackeys and similar theme of &#34;alter egos&#34;), and My Neighbor Totoro (whose Cat Bus was split into a normal bus scene and a magical-spirit-dog-powered transportation scene.)  There are some truly cathartic moments - particularly the reawakening of the old &#34;spirits&#34; of folklore at the end - which are only somewhat sullied by a nagging feeling of hollowness to the characters which I'll get to in a second.  The animation, similarly to Ghibli's, is good, but somewhat inconsistent, perhaps taking a page out of the Japanese book of animation production, which prioritizes shots to control workload, conserving extra keyframes and in-between frames to shots where it will count the most.  Sadly, it seems that at certain points, budget or time constraints forced some very rough-looking animation to make it into the final cut in places where it was unfortunately conspicuous.  It's hard not to notice the lack of detail in much of the actual motion of the characters themselves - think of it as TV serial quality animation on steroids - which perhaps was meant to go hand-in-hand with the minimalistic character design - but it does not always service the story as effectively as it should.  Some scenes are done better than others, and it's easy to downplay it for not being up to the level of Disney or Ghibli in terms of attention to detail, but the quality of the animation sits somewhere in the area of &#34;adequate&#34;.  Crucial scenes, particularly involving any dialog, are surprisingly abbreviated for an hour-and-a-half-long screenplay, which seems to favor poignant, pretty vignettes over convincing characters.  Some of the worst bits of dialog can be found at the conclusion.  &#34;Saoirse's a selkie?&#34;  &#34;Yeah.&#34;  That shot was particularly enraging because the father's response (or lack of one) did nothing to resolve the impenetrable ambiguity of the father's actions up to that point.  The visuals of the film are so lush it sets the viewer up to expect a story that is sophisticated and, one would hope, also accurate in its portrayal of how people would act in this situation.  However there are many, many broadly-stroked exchanges between characters that unfortunately leave all the characters easily-digestible and predictable.  The brother is the most fleshed out of all, but he isn't particularly believable, being more of a cute-ified abstraction of a troubled boy presented at arm's length than a character I could truly believe and relate to.  Ponyo this is not, but for a second outing, it's a remarkable and definitely unforgettable achievement.  This is bound to become a favorite of children all over, while also being well-enjoyed by adults alike.",2015-08-27,0.4,False,0

I still remember Neo (the main character of the movie) dodging bullets and me trying to follow him. I loved the actions and the graphics. Then I saw a commercial that The Matrix Reloaded (2nd of The Matrix series) was released in the theater. I begged my parents to go watch it. This is how much I was into “The Matrix”. When I grew much older and saw “The Matrix” again, it was not just a simple action movie. It was complicated and philosophical. Even now, I do not fully understand it. However, despite understanding of the movie, I am positive that even a seven year old child could enjoy the movie. What makes “The Matrix” so interesting? “The Matrix” is a difficult movie. It contains many philosophies, thoughts, and even religious symbols. It is almost impossible for people to get a grasp of all these ideas by just watching the movie once. In order to fully understand the movie, people should watch it over and over again. Every time people watch it, they will find some new ideas that they have not noticed previously and will be fascinated that the movie contained such ideas. This aspect provides people the opportunity to rethink about the movie and understand it even better. As people gradually understand the movie, they will like the movie more and more. “The Matrix” is about machines and humans. In the movie, the machines have already taken over the world and use people as a resource to gain energy. They connect people’s conscious to a virtual world which is called Matrix. The Matrix is just the same as our real world except that it is actually a program. The purpose of connecting human’s mind to the Matrix is to prevent any acts that people can exercise when they are awake. However, there are some people who know that the Matrix is not real. Movie “The Matrix” is about humans fighting machines to get their real world back. The first movie of “The Matrix” series was released in 1999. Although it was released a long time ago, computer graphics are amazing. Throughout the movie, it was hard to find any awkwardness in the scenes. Most of the scenes are remarkable. Not only computer graphics but camera techniques are also great. “The Matrix” is a really good example of flow-motion technique (one of the camera techniques). The use of flow-motion technique is expressed well in the scene where Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) jumps and kicks police officer. Also, there is a scene so popular that many people who did not see the movie even knows about. As you might have already guessed, it is a scene where Neo (Keanu Reeves) dodges the bullets. Slow motion video, sound effects, flow-motion technique, and computer graphics are so well used that it became one of the best scenes throughout the movie history.  In Matrix, “flying” means a lot. It is not like a super power that Superman has. The only people who could use “super power” in Matrix are the ones who found enlightenment. There is a scene where Neo visits Oracle (Gloria Foster). In the house, Neo meets a child who could bend the spoon. This act is only possible because the child has gained the understanding that the world they are living in (Matrix) is not real but a program that is just like the real. Thus, in order to use these “psychic powers”, one must doubt the world that is surrounding him and realize that it is not real. The act of ‘realizing the world’ in Buddhism is expressed as reaching nirvana. In Neo’s case, his reaching to nirvana was quite different from the child who bent a spoon. Neo was taught by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Therefore, when Neo tries to bend a spoon, it takes a while for him because he is not yet fully in state of nirvana. However, as the movie proceeds, Neo himself fully realizes the matrix is not real and reaches nirvana, allowing him to beat agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and to fly. The idea of “The Matrix” is based on the book named “Simulacra, Simulation”. In the scene where Neo sells the disc to a buyer, Neo puts his money in the book. This is the scene where the book appears. Simulacra means “A fake without real” and Simulation means “Something that does not exist but feels more real rather than the things do exist”. This concept perfectly describes the world Matrix. People in the Matrix think they are living in the real world. They do not have a single doubt. In reality, Matrix is a fake. It is “Simulacra”. However, there are some people who know that the Matrix is a fake but still live in it. Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) knows the reality and he still chose to stay in Matrix. It is because inside the Matrix feels more real than the reality. The Matrix gives him much more pleasure than the real world. This is what “Simulation” means.  When the spelling of Neo is rearranged, it becomes the “one”. In the movie, Neo eventually turns out to be the “one”. What is interesting about this is that the “one” (Neo) might actually stand for Jesus. There is a scene where Neo gets shot by agent Smith and dies. However, after Trinity kisses him, he miraculously revives. This might mean that the “one” (Jesus) has revived by the love of god. Also, there is a scene that Neo sacrifices himself to defeat agent Smith therefore bringing peace to the world. This scene might stand for Jesus’s sacrifice for the humanity.  “The Matrix” is definitely a movie that would leave its name in movie history. It has great philosophies, religious symbols, and ideas. Despite its complexity and contents, the whole plot is well organized. I watched the whole series of Matrix a dozen of times and every time I watched it, I found something new that I had not thought about before. For those who just want to watch it for fun, it is completely fine. Actions and computer graphics are so amazing that it will keep you interested. However, once youunderstand the movie, I guarantee that you will have much more fun.",2015-08-28,1.0,True,1

It provided my husband with all the logical and scientific answers he needed in order to change his dietary habits.

I could not explain it to my husband in the detailed, specific way he was needing in order to understand, but this movie did it for him. And it made me more confident in my decision to become a vegan. We really enjoyed how the documentary showed individuals from different socioeconomic classes practicing a plant-based, animal-free diet and the effects it had on their health and life. This proved that this lifestyle is possible for anyone to adopt. If you have not made the decision to reduce the amount of animal product in your diet, do not let that discourage you from watching this film. There is plenty of useful information mentioned that applies to meat-eaters, vegans and all in between. Be open minded and take what you will from this documentary. Hopefully you will be inspired like my family was.<br />PS: There is not a lot of footage about animal cruelty in this documentary.

It's true, some of her bits do come off as trying too hard for a laugh from shocking and making audience uncomfortable at moment. But I noticed something interesting. OK, this is dated 2013, and for sure Sarah and her style have long ago preceded Amy Schumer... But 2014-2015 begat the year of Amy Schumer, and having seen many examples now of her performances, I really have to say that, technique-wise, Amy actually pulls off in a much more seamless manner that &#34;throwing away&#34; a joke line, then looking puzzled when the audience laughs. Multiple times in this funny Sarah HBO special, she had calculated written material whose jokes were constructed this way — with the throw away line, then the puzzled kind of &#34;What??&#34; look to the audience like &#34;What did i say? I didn't say anything wrong&#34; and playing all that for a laugh.  Sarah's very polished in both her timing and ease in performance but I have to say, perhaps due to the intimacy of the audience size just 39 people, her technique showed ... and my point is, I hate to say it but for that category of joke construction, Amy is far more polished and naturalistic where you just can't see half her witticisms coming. ... This is not to take anything away fom Sarah, but I just felt overall, the material that comprised this show didn't feel that strong. It was surprisingly moralistic and almost kind of preachy re the lies we all tell ourselves... as well as social commentary on neediness of people at certain stages in life. And to that extent it was a great use of the comedy form to communicate things that matter. There were some purely funny bits — her dog's farts being like the worst of every ethnicity's, then breathed through her grandpa's teeth, her mother getting benefits of Jewish Volunteer Services in the hospital when how could they know she was Jewish by her name — &#34;turns out they work from a list of who rings the call button the most&#34;.r mother getting benefits of Jewish Volunteer Services in the hospital when how could they know she was Jewish by her name — &#34;turns out they work from a list of who rings the call button the most&#34;.",2015-08-22,0.6666666666666666,False,0

The economically stalled town doesn't help.  Everyone seems to be lost.<br /><br />The equilibrium of the family is beautifully portrayed, as is he environment they live in.  Gilbert takes care of everyone, particularly his autistic brother (in a Oscar-worthy performance by Leonardo de Caprio) leaving no room for himself.  His siblings are similarly stalled, but they are taking care of his mother, who is mired in a depression and, as a consequence, morbidly obese and in many ways, the joke of the town.  His circle of friends and his lover are sympathetic and often funny, but there is another level to them that is extremely sad.  Meanwhile, the town is being hollowed out by a Walmart-like box store on the outskirts; there is no industry, no interesting jobs, just stagnation and mediocrity.<br /><br />Of course, something happens to upset the equilibrium, the arrival of a girl (Juliet Lewis, who is a radiant youth yet appears plain).  She gets him to question everything in a clear way, rather than the muddled ruminations he indulges in as life passes him by.  The care for his autistic brother seems to open them to each other, which threatens everything that people depend on Gilbert for, his shackles of love and obligation.  His mother begs him not to leave as his father had done.<br /><br />I will not say what happens, but it is unexpected the way things work out.

And it's certainly as crappy as most of our flicks. There were some familiar faces in the cast, so I had some high hopes for the story.  But when your blueprint is so weak and the leads lack chemistry... not much is going to save it.<br /><br />This is basically about Frankie Del Vecchio (Diana DeGarmo), lead singer in a band called The Altos, who stumbles upon some criminal activity by the Italian mob.  Frankie's sister is obsessed with the popular show Mob Hit and convinces her sister they should look into things a bit more.  This leads Frankie into Nicolette Bellafusco's (Natalie Knepp) world.... hot Italian daughter of the new mafia don.<br /><br />It's love at first sight for Nicolette.  Frankie, however, is very straight and has a serious boyfriend.  This doesn't stop Nicolette from pursuing her and the two eventually get something started.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I was mostly wondering what the hell was going on with the other subplots... but I just couldn't bring myself to care enough to clarify or rewind. I even fell asleep during the movie and had to finish it later... it got a bit dull.  There's a load of Italian guys up to some activity, but I was never quite sure what.  In pursuit of the mob is a goofy FBI agent or two... again, not really sure what they were after or if they ever got it or just gave up or what. The backstories and threads are just kind of incomplete and disorganized.  Poor editing.<br /><br />Other weirdness is that Nicolette is in love at first sight, but she acts like a total skank going after other women at the same time.  I didn't get the attraction between these two.  Seems like more should have happened between them other than... eh... magic?  I wish they'd done more than touched upon their cultural differences.  That could have given the story more depth and some legitimacy in terms of their attraction and connection. The actress who played Frankie (American Idol fame from 2004) is actually very pretty and very talented as an actress and a singer... but I'm sorry... I could only register straight species, lol. She had zero gay vibe and I wasn't buying anything between these two.  No chemistry.  Loved Frankie's sister, though... fun character.<br /><br />Not the worst lez-themed movie I've ever seen... but the script killed it.  Acting, overall, was so-so.  I think they probably just forced a lot of scenes for Diana Degarmo's talent rather than focusing on a more honest story.  She'd be great in some other movies, but I don't think playing lesbian is one of her talents.  As for Natalie Knepp... come hither... :P<br /><br />I think there was only kissing here.

With that said, most movies these days seem to betray a lack of science and technology understanding, and this movie was no exception.  There were just too many high-tech cringe moments for me to give it four stars.<br /><br />[Spoiler alert]<br /><br />You're probably thinking I'm going to complain about the implants.  Nope.  Those are semi-plausible, though they wouldn't be nearly that tiny.  And the gadgets are a little dubious, but I'm okay with suspension of disbelief.  Where this story went off the rails was in its incorporation of real world tech.<br /><br />The main plot involved a villain using custom SIM cards to put a sizable percentage of all the world's cell phones onto a special network, and then delivering an auditory signal that makes people go nuts and kill each other.  I'll ignore for the moment the unlikelihood of that being possible (suspension of disbelief again), and I'll ignore the unlikelihood of cell phones being loud enough to do so on such a broad scale.  But I just can't bring myself to ignore the satellites....<br /><br />The most egregious problem with the satellites was the scene in which they used two weather balloons to lift a girl up high enough to shoot down a satellite with a shoulder-fired missile.  A quick Wikipedia search reveals that the highest altitude ever recorded by a weather balloon was only about 53 km (33 miles).  Another quick Wikipedia search tells you that low Earth orbit starts at about 160 miles (but isn't really usable at such a low altitude).  So in the best-case scenario, the girl would have been trying to aim at a satellite around 110 km (68 miles) above her.  In fact, she'd only be about 20–30% closer while hanging under the balloons than she would be if she were standing atop the tallest mountain on the surface of Earth....<br /><br />Worse, I'm fairly certain it isn't even theoretically possible to build a balloon that could lift a person tolow Earth orbit, because the lift capacity of a balloon decreases very rapidly with altitude, falling to almost nothing by the time you get to 30 km or so; the lift from a balloon is caused by the difference in air density between the inside of the balloon and the outside, and when you're that high up, there's very little air at all, so it is very hard for the density inside to be significantly lower than nearly zero.  In fact, the record altitude for a human-flown balloon is only 41 km.  Exceeding that altitude record by a factor of four or five would be bordering on insanity.<br /><br />Speaking of lift capacity, two weather balloons would have a typical lift capacity of 10–20 pounds even at sea level, which isn't enough to lift my backpack, much less an entire person with a giant missile launcher strapped to her back.  She would likely need closer to 30-50 of them just to get off the ground.  Two isn't even in the ballpark.<br /><br />And even if you could miraculously get a balloon high enough, you would quickly run into an even bigger problem.  Orbital velocity is fast.  Really fast.  That same Wikipedia article on low Earth orbit tells you just how fast.  A satellite at the very bottom of low Earth orbit goes all the way around the planet in approximately 90 minutes (88, to be precise).  That means it goes from the North Pole to the Equator in approximately 22.5 minutes, or from the northern border of the United States (not counting the northeastern states) to the southern border (not counting the tip of Texas) in about 6 1/2 minutes.  In the two minutes or so that it took her to aim the missile, the satellite she was trying to hit would have travelled about 600 miles.  That's somewhere in the neighborhood of 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour, or 7.8 km (4.8 miles) per second, for those of you keeping score.<br /><br />Ignoring the question of whether somebody could aim at a target moving that quickly (even if it were moving almost straight towards you), does anybody know how to build a shoulder-fired missile that can fly at 17,000 MPH (about Mach 50)?  Because if you do, I'm sure NASA would love to talk to you.  :-)<br /><br />Of course, there is a kind of satellite that doesn't move relative to Earth.  Those are celled geostationary satellites.  Unfortunately, to get to those, you'd need a weather balloon that would lift a person up to 35,786 km (22,236 miles)—almost 700x higher than any balloon has ever flown.  Even if it were theoretically possible, building such a balloon would probably require orders of magnitude more hydrogen and helium than exists on our planet, and the balloon would probably start out at hundreds of miles in diameter or more.<br /><br />Also, if you somehow pulled off such an impossible feat getting her back down without the benefit of gravity pulling on her in any meaningful way would be highly problematic.  After all, the reason those satellites stay up there is that gravity doesn't do much at that distance.  And if you somehow managed to solve those two problems, she'd probably burn up on the way back down.  There's a reason we don't ever attempt to recover satellites from geostationary orbit.  It just isn't practical.  And this is assuming that such a purely theoretical balloon would somehow exhibit enough atmospheric drag to keep you above the same point on Earth on an ongoing basis, effectively accelerating you to about 3 km/s during your ascent, which seems pretty unlikely.<br /><br />Of course, that's all a moot point, because satellites can't possibly carry a signal to unmodified cell phones in the first place.  Any cell phone that uses SIM cards for voice communication is likely to be using GSM, which has a 35 km (22 mile) range limit that cannot be exceeded without completely redesigning the way that the devices communicate at a fundamental level.  Low Earth orbit satellites orbit starts at 160 km (99 miles).  So even if you could magically convince a satellite to communicate on the right frequency, the time division algorithm in the cell phones would make communication impossible.  Ah, but what about LTE, you might ask?  That has a hard upper limit of 103 km for establishing an initial connection.  So that can't work, either.  The only cellular protocol that *might* be able to pull off communication at that distance (I'm not sure) is CDMA, but CDMA doesn't use SIM cards.<br /><br />Also, there's the problem of it being infeasible to replace cellular tech with satellite tech because of insufficient availability of spectrum.  Cellular phones broadcast omnidirectionally, requiring fairly directional receivers, which isn't practical at LEO altitudes, at least when the devices are transmitting with the miniscule amount of power that modern cell phones can generate.  And you would need several satellites just to cover the U.S.  (For example, the Iridium constellation consists of 66 satellites.)  That's just one of many reasons that satellite phones use entirely different communication hardware, and cost an enormous amount of money to use.<br /><br />Finally, even from the perspective of the ground, I suspect that satellites in low Earth orbit would be moving way too quickly for cellular phones to connect to them.  If you could somehow get past the distance limits, you'd still have the speed limit (250 km/hr or 155 MPH for GSM, 350 km/hr or 217 MPH for LTE).  The nature of time division multiplexing requires devices to do their transmitting and receiving within specified time intervals, and there are limits to how far the devices can adjust those time intervals.  Changing those limits would require significant changes to the protocols, which translates &#34;custom cell phones&#34;.  That's why high-speed trains have their own cellular sites on the trains themselves, and use specially modified hardware to exchange data with specially modified base stations using a nonstandard cellular protocol.  And that's not even taking into account the doppler shift problem, which becomes significant at 17,000 MPH.<br /><br />While I'm at it, I should also add that it typically takes many days to bring a spare satellite into position unless you expend insane amounts of fuel to shift one satellite at altitude into the orbital plane of another.  That part was kind of implausible.  Then again, the notion that taking out a single satellite in a constellation (a group of satellites working together) would have any real impact on the operation of the constellation as a whole is also wrong.  In fact, you could take out potentially one or more satellites in each of a constellation's orbital planes (the circle in which a group of satellites travels) without having any impact at all on actual satellite phones, so long as adjacent missing satellites weren't near the same latitude at the same time.  The only way taking out a single satellite would ever matter would be if you were dealing with geostationary satellites, and again, you're not going to get a balloon that high.  You couldn't even get the Space Shuttle that high.  (620 km was its record, which is only about a sixtieth as high as those satellites.)  In fact, as far as I know, we've never recovered anything from that altitude other than the Apollo moon missions....<br /><br />So please, Hollywood, if you're going to use real technology, please, please, please use it in ways that could actually be plausible.

The major problem, other than some rather unnecessary plot lines, is that the film leaves no room for belief in anything other than either Atheism or Christianity. Not even room for Agnosticism. As with many issues that are at the forefront of our culture, such as being a republican or democrat, pro-life or pro-choice, and many other &#34;hot-button&#34; issues, it is often frowned upon to not have a polarized opinion in one direction or the other but life is never that simple. And this movie polarizes the issue of god in a Christian light implying that it is either no god or the Christian conception of God.<br /><br />I'm assuming the title of the film is playing off that famous, and all too misunderstood, Nietzsche quote &#34;God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him...&#34; There is more but the misunderstanding comes in when taking this literally that God was once alive and is now dead. Nietzsche believed that God is a concept that only exists because people believe that God exists and therefore they are responsible for him existing at all. By implying that God is dead, Nietzsche is saying that God no longer exists because the people who believed in him no longer believe in the way that they did before, to put it simply. The film makes the argument that without God there would be no need for morality but Nietzsche would disagree and argue that there is Truth greater than that of Christian values and that the lack of belief in God allows one to get closer to the actual essence of objective Reality and Truth not just the truth discovered in the reality of believing in the Christian God.<br /><br />I don't agree or disagree with the point trying to be made by the film. I more so find issue with the film trying to answer the question &#34;Is God dead?&#34; or argue that God is &#34;alive&#34; without first defining in great detail what God is, or what dead or alive mean.

This happened twice allegedly, first during the 6 days of creation and again during the flood of Noah. This means that every plant, animal and human you see in the US today and ...in this movie...were supposed to ...according to the bible...be descendants of those on Noahs boat. The ancestors of the native americans would have died. Native Americans were...according to archaeology...in the US many thousands of years before the flood date. Think Native Americans in the US prior to 12000 years ago and Noahs flood killing them all about 4700 years ago. The bear, deer, mountain lion, buffalo, squirrels, trees would also have died in Noahs flood. The US would have been nothing but dead mud. Instead of descending from those dead human ancestors, if the bible is accepted, this means that Native Americans are descendant not from earlier Native American ancestors but from a Jewish family in the middle east (ie Noah and his family). Thats not what geneaology/ DNA  shows. Now why...would the bible lie about that? The vatican now claims that genesis with the flood story is &#34;religious poetry and not literally true. There is a problem however. In the latter half of the bible ie the &#34;new testament&#34; the writers of the 4 &#34;gospels&#34; claim in 2 of the 4 books that the genealogy of Jesus was known and was recorded in those &#34;gospels&#34;. Jesus claimed to descend from Noah and his son Shem, both of whomthe vatican now admits were mythical characters. This is equivalent to jesus swearing his ancestors were the tooth fairy and the easter bunny.<br /><br />So what about the Jewish god / god of the bible? Please read about caananite gods. Apparently like the Romans and Greeks, the people of the region where the Jews lived believed in many gods. The priests of the Yawyah group according to the old testament frequently ordered the mass murder of those from other groups. Later the spin was that Yahway was always the only god and was the world creater. Initially the high god of the Caananite group of gods was El with his wife / consort Asherah. Theses two gods are actually found if you look them up in a bible concordance.<br /><br />So why a global flood story re the flood of Noah? Seashells can be found on and in mountain rock. The ancients really didnt understand about mountains building up over time and plate tectonics, so the only way they guessed to explain seashells in high places was a global flood. This was wrong. If they had some direct access to a god giving them correct answers, they wouldnt have gotten this so very WRONG.<br /><br />Today the understanding is that Yahway was not the original high god in Caananite myth. We know of the episodes of mass murder needed to spin things differently. We know there was no global flood. We know the earths crust is made up of separate plates which move, and sometimes collide pushing up mountains. The movement of such plates is very slow (about the speed of your fingernail growth). This material is already known and already in public encyclopedias.<br /><br />All this doesnt prove or disprove a god, but ...it does prove the christian mythology is a lie. Since noahs flood was a myth when it was written, a person who claimed Noah and his son as ancestors would have been a liar. No true religion follows liars nor encourages lies.<br /><br />Know that the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian religion all believe in Noahs flood ...soits pivotal.<br /><br />Also know that Noahs flood would have killed the ancestors of plants that became new world food crops. These plants developed into foods that were only found in the Americas. This includes foods like the Potato and tomato. You know the Noahs flood story is a lie because French Fries and Catsup exists. Those ancestral plants werent killed. Nor do you see those plants missing from all except the middle east after around the time period of the flood date and then spreading from the middle east. Also a new world food crop is cacao from which we make chocolate. Noah's flood would have killed those plants as well.<br /><br />Teachers of christianity promise you eternal happyness / heaven if you join up and believe. They promise you hell fire if you dont. You dont need a reward for believing in gravity nor threat of punishment if you dont. You can analyze the facts and know....gravity is true. You can also analyze the facts and know christianity is a lie.<br /><br />The reason I am bothering is that apparently there are people that may see this film and may be mislead into thinking christianity is a GOOD thing. Maybe the real cosmic test if there is one is ....are you willing to tollerate lies and liars...no matter what they promise you or threaten. Also religion has been used worldwide through out history to justify too many wars.<br /><br />Cant we all tell the truth and stop pushing a lie.<br /><br />If you watch the first few minutes of the film and find it dripping with christian propaganda, know...that the film does not get any better.<br /><br />Before you send me hate mail for this review, know this: some of my ancestors were Native American, so if the flood story actually were true, I could not possibly exist. If my ancestors died during Noah's flood, I dont exist. Ancestors must survive to produce the people living today.  If you KNOW the bible is true, you would not act as though I do exist by sending me email. You would be proving you dont believe your own &#34;holy book&#34;<br /><br />The actors do a decent job in trying to salvage this piece. They need better writing of character dialog.<br /><br />The reviews are mixed. Christians will give this 5 stars for rubber stamping their belief system. Others seem to be giving it 1 star.<br /><br />For christians it's old news. For all others the pitch is INSULTING.",2015-08-23,0.25,False,0

Morgan Freeman was, well, Morgan Freeman and his performance in a role that seemed written for his large cinematic persona was predictable. But the weight he brings to any role made the others pale by comparison. Decca Gardner (as Griff) has better days ahead as she grows into her acting ability.<br /><br />Josh Lucas did as much as he could with a limited character of Sherif Curtis, and Damian Lewis as the abusive boyfriend was appropriately malevolent and not too over the top, which is easy to do in that role. Carmen Manheim was, again, over her head in an otherwise fairly simply role.<br /><br />I haven't read the book but the screenplay teased out the storyline in a way that kept me interested (despite the acting) and surprised at points.

As for special effects or CGI content ...it was probably the worst I have ever seen. The tsunami was seemingly a Magic Tsunami that didn't actually destroy anything. Instead things just faded and disappeared while the unmoving wave hovered in the background spitting out what looked like puffs of dust.

In the second episode, the pace picks up and the deftly written script, along with the exceptional acting, will carry you through to the end. Standouts are Paul McGann as Wrayburn, and Keeley Hawes as Lizzie. Their story is heartbreakingly beautiful, and the two actors do it complete justice. The production is also to be commended in that it does not shy away from the core message of the book -- a scathing commentary on class disparity in Victorian England.

Kaddish is recited at the graveside, not Shema. The Native American ritual was likewise built on stereotype and very little knowledge of authentic tradition. &#34;Wolf,&#34; whom &#34;Tiger&#34; meets just too conveniently pops up at very contrived moments, and his father being in the hospital is just too precious and absurd.

This is not a story you watch mindlessly as entertainment when you want to veg-out. Be prepared to pay attention to what is said, and what is NOT said. Once the film ends, you should be asking a LOT of questions about our law enforcement, judicial system and Bill of Rights (specifically the U.S. Constitution).<br /><br />HOW did the U.S. government find and get access to those servers? WHY aren't they telling?<br />WHO are all the people acting as Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR)? Were any of them FBI/CIA agents?<br />WHY is only one person being charged for the activities of the Silk Road?<br />WHY aren't the sellers of drugs being charged for their crimes, but one site administrator is the fall guy for all?<br />WHAT precedent does this set to charge other website administrators for activities of their participants? (Craigslist was not charged for Craigslist Killer. Will this case change that in future cases?)<br />WHY is Ross Ulbricht accused of setting up hits on several people, but he was never indicted for murder? Even with all the 'evidence'?<br />Was the purpose to deprive him of bail so he was unable to effectively defend himself with the Truth?<br />WAS Ross Ulbricht being set up? If so, by WHOM? Was it another DPR? Was it a FBI or CIA agent?<br />WAS evidence fraudulently planted by investigators to make him look guilty?<br />WHY was the defense denied their own experts from testifying?<br />HOW can a person be denied their constitutional right to due process by govt. obstruction & delay of access to discovery evidence?<br />HOW can someone who is peaceful, non-violent, with no priors be sentenced to life in prison for a crime that had no victims? (Bill Cosby had dozens of victims come forward of a violent crime, but never arrested, indicted, much less convicted.)<br />WHY was all the prosecution's 'evidence' admitted and heard by the jury, but all the defense's hard core evidence suppressed from ever being heard?<br />HOW does the government get away with perjury in such a high profile case? WHAT are they hiding? WHY?<br />IS the case against Ross Ulbricht REALLY about the war on drugs . . . is our Big Brother Government setting the stage for something more heinous against it's citizens? (think Patriot Act)<br /><br />If you walk away from this documentary only judging whether Ross Ulbricht should pay for his crime with a life sentence as a website administrator, then you missed the bigger issue and you are encouraged to watch it again with an open mind . . . forgetting what mainstream media sensationalized to get higher ratings. Alex Winter does not lead you to a conclusion of Ross Ulbricht's guilt or innocence. Instead, he does a 'most excellent' job of  stimulating you to think and think deeply. (Whoa! Dude!) You will simultaneously love and hate him for doing this to you. Once you are done digesting this documentary, you should be mad as hell and ready to fight for your rights as a U.S. citizen and a human being.<br /><br />My only 'complaint' is wishing to have footage of the trial to watch and hear for my own eyes when the judge openly stated she was going to use Ross Ulbricht to make him an example, and when she flip-flopped from Friday to Monday regarding the need to admit the defense's evidence and getting answers from the prosecution.<br /><br />There is a direct connection between his arrest, handling of his trial, severity of his sentence and the negative impact Bitcoin (a peer-to-peer crypto-currency that exists outside the control of governments and banks) has on the owner's of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB - a privately-owned, foreign, illegal & unlawful, ponzi-scheme of fiat currency backed by nothing). I believe this is the TRUE reason behind the corruption and severity in the Ross Ulbricht case. The actions on the part of the DOJ, Judges, and all the FBI and CIA agents falsely representing themselves as &#34;federal govt. employees&#34; is literally TREASON by definition.<br /><br />If it can be proven the federal judge, Katherine Bolan Forrest, has ever been given a title of nobility such as &#34;Esquire&#34;, or if she was ever a member on any B.A.R. (British Accreditation Registry), then she is automatically expatriated from American citizenship and is unable to hold any office of trust (including judge and jury).

There's a slight amount of flex possible in the phone but it appears to handle it well.<br /><br />Button placement - Horrible - 1/5 HTC decided, for whatever reason, to put the power button, and the volume buttons on the same side (right side) of the bezel. they are in fairly close proximity to each other, so you will find yourself pressing the power button at times when you are trying to adjust volume. also the placement of the power button itself could not have been in a worse place. It rests about 2/3 of the way up the bezel, which conveniently, (or not so much so) is right where most people grab the phone when in use, thus causing you to constantly, inadvertently press the power button  and subsequently locking your phone in the middle of whatever you were doing. It also causes you to hit the power button while removing your phone from your pocket. ***MAJOR ANNOYANCE***<br /><br />Screen - Decent - 3/5. For a low/mid range device, the screen is adequate. The colors are pretty true, but the blacks look a bit more grey, than a true deep black. not a deal killer unless you are a videophile or just super picky about the black level on your device. it has an ips screen which allows viewing from extreme angles, without the image &#34;washing out&#34; or flipping negative&#34; it has a 720x1280  resolution with 294ppi density (for the nerds). the device has light sensing capability and for the most part, it does a good job keeping the screen view-able in most conditions. it also can get pretty bright if you use the manual back-light settings.<br /><br />Sound - HORRIBLE - 1/5. First off, HTC decided not to add the BOOM SOUND hardware to this device. It appears to have the signature HTC stereo front facing speakers, but in reality, the top speaker grill is only the earpiece speaker. The lower grill houses the loudspeaker which, at its highest setting, is only marginally loud in a quiet setting. and if you work, or happen to be located somewhere where there is background noise, you can pretty much forget the speakerphone, or listening to music without headphones. Consequentially, ringer volume also suffers, and i have had several instances where i have missed calls or notifications because i simply didn't hear the thing ring. Even in my pocket. Aftermarket &#34;super loud&#34; ringtones help a bit, but....<br /><br />Software - HTC Sense 7 UI. Its HTC Sense. what can you say. the lock screen sucks. its not customizable with widgets or anything useful. it comes with a big basic clock with weather, and the basic dock icons at the bottom which allows you to choose what function you want to unlock into. ie, phone contacts messages internet, and there aren't any options to modify this configuration that i have located as of this posting. also the pattern (9 dots) is quite small compared to the available screen space making it more likely to make an error while inputting your security pattern code.<br /><br />vibration - 2/5 - Weak at best. could miss it, even in your pocket.<br /><br />STORAGE - Marginal / low - 2/5. The device touts 8 gig of storage, but alas, after the OS and bloatware go on, the end user is left with somewhere around 3.75 gigs of space to play with. For a sub $100 device, it could be considered acceptable, but there really needs to be something done with manufacturers misrepresenting ROM, as if the advertised space is truly whats available to the end-user. Supposedly, the new Lollipop version of android includes the capability to WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, but using the latest ES file explorer, i still have difficulty writing files and creating folders on the external sd. But thats not the manufacturers fault its Android. but it needed to be said. Get an external card adapter if you want to add your music or movie collection to the sd card, as i have attempted to lan transfer files to the ext sd, and some larger files ended up corrupted, or disappeared altogether after a reboot.<br /><br />Processor speed - 3/5. Again This is a sub $100 device but the decision to include a Snapdragon 210, instead of a SD410 baffles me. the device experiences some lag switching between apps, unlocking, and pretty much any type of multitasking events attempted. it doesn't totally kill the experience, but if you are used to snappy switching between apps, you will notice the lag time. Playing a full 1080p trailer from internal memory resulted in a slightly choppy, but not unwatchable video.<br /><br />Calls - 4/5 Haven't really had any complaints making and receiving calls using the handset, although i have heard that the speakerphone function sounds muffled at times<br /><br />Cameras. Fairly decent. with the HDR mode, you can get some pretty clear pics. the included picture was taken at dusk, with no flash, in HDR mode. Video appears to be of a decent quality, and there is a rear facing mic to capture sound<br /><br />Durability. ?/5 - it has been dropped, several times. A couple times on corners, and with the exception of a minor ding or 2, the device seems to be<br />none the worse. Not sure what material the screen is made of but it seems to scratch fairly easy, as i have a slight scratch or two that i still dont know where they came from. (not from dropping it) possibly something in my pocket, but my device always has its own pocket, so i don't know. only time will tell how well this device holds up to the rigors of a rough and tumble environment. And i purchased the white one specifically so i could see what surface wear was occurring, and how being handled with oily hands and being in a dusty shop affects the outer shell<br /><br />Battery Life - 3/5 - The device ships with a NON-REMOVABLE 2000mah battery which in my opinion, is too small of a battery to be in a device with a 5 inch screen. leaving the screen on and/ or using high brightness mode, you can practically watch the battery level go down. with moderate usage, you can make it through the day without having to charge, but if you do a lot of social media or watching videos, you might want to keep a charger handy. on another note, the device charges fairly quickly, so the trade off is marginal, IF you have a charger with you. there is also a power saving mode, and an extreme power saving mode that turns off almost all the advanced functions, leaving only basic functionality, but greatly extends your battery life. In an emergency, it could be the difference between a dead phone, and still having basic communication.<br /><br />Bluetooth. - 4/5 - paired to my bluetooth helmet fairly easily. plays music and takes phone calls. The volume was lower than my previous device in the helmet speakers.<br /><br />Wifi. -5/5 connected and held the connection for a decent distance away from the router. haven't had any issues with disconnects or authentication problems.<br /><br />Sim Card and Micro sd card slots are located on the left edge, under a plastic door. the device supposedly supports up to 200 gig of sd expansion, although i have never seen a 200gb micro sd card.<br /><br />Root - ? - As of this posting, there isn't any publicly known method to root this device.<br /><br />Overall - 3/5 - This device is more suited for a casual user, that wants smartphone capability. The basic functions operate well enough. but if you want or need a snappy response or you are a power user, this device may not be for you. Dont get this device confused with the HTC 626, which specs out at 16gigs of onboard memory and has an 8Mp camera insteadof a 5Mp and has the SD410 chip versus the SD210.",2015-08-31,0.9,True,0

All of it leads to the present-day Bristol Bay vs. Pebble Mine controversy --  the final (?) great conflict which threatens the last significant run of wild salmon.
