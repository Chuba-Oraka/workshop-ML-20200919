Best quality children's show you can get.  My toddler is obsessed!!,1
OK. I don't see anything different then the rated version.,0
"There just wasn;t a story in this movie.  Depended on nude girls to carry the show, and they didn't carry the show.",0
"I really liked this movie.  It had a lot of tense moments, scary scenes and good acting.",1
"This was the most frustrating movie I have watched in a long time. I mean, I can't even. I literally can't even.",0
"I love this story, the message presented is so very true. Pigs are very intelligent, loving creatures with feelings, just like all other animals. James Cromwell, the lead actor is a great real-life animal rights activist, and he was perfect for this role. #GoVegan",1
"It's very gory and scary! The darkness has thickened in season 5. It's definitely more intense and awesome. It really doesn't have the light themes anymore. However, this season a lot of the characters are on my nerves. The plot is twisty and cool! The mystery and time swap is really interesting!",1
"Agonizingly slow movie, full of extremely stupid people.  On the surface it sounds interesting, a phantom entity hunting the victim and no one else can see it.  Unfortunately &#34;it&#34; is about the lamest horror entity ever conceived.  Sure, it can find you anywhere; but the supernatural world has put some astonishingly limiting rules on it.  One, it is SLOW.  And I mean SLOW.  Michael Myers and Jason always walked, but when you weren't looking they seemingly sprinted, catching up with the victim. Not &#34;it&#34;.  &#34;It&#34; literally trods along as if it has all the time in the world.  And it is hindered by everything a normal person is: doors, walls, window, fences, you name it.  It is burdened by the physical world as no supernatural murdering villain has EVER been burdened before.  It doesn't even have the strength to knock down doors, instead relying on rocks thrown through windows to enter houses.  Bullets to the head down it for awhile; and I'm fairly confident had they locked it in cage all their problems would've been solved.",0
"It was rather morose.  I would have rather learned more about her life and how the addiction progressed, as opposed to just a string of interviews with relatives and friends.",0
"It was OK , The fight scenes are to long",0
"Odd,erotic,tragic,visually sumptuous,darkly sexual,almost obsessive.",1
Good program. Kids enjoy it,1
"No other show I can recall focuses so much on the importance of personal values, family and the importance of &#34;always doing the right thing for the right reasons&#34;",1
It's a dark and realistic 'drama' of what it must be like to get someone focusing on more than his/her addiction.<br />I really like Mr. Bratt and am impressed with his as well as the cast's nuance performance.,1
This would be funny but the gratuitous sex ruins some of it.  Why cant Amazon have any series that do not include an explicit sex scene per episode?<br />There are some nice points in this but this stuff drives me back to networks on television that don't assume I need light porn to watch TV.,0
Don't need to see the love seens so explicit...men and men and all...........rather let my brain figure it out,0
Excellent movie,1
Good Movie,1
too wierd,0
Great and waiting for more!!,1
"This started out well.  The first episode was entertaining, but the second and third sort of petered out.  By the end, I got tired of the long distance shots of his &#34;walking away from the camera for dramatic effect.&#34;  If you just watch the first episode and leave it at that, you won't be disappointed.  Spoiler - in the end, nothing get resolved much more than that anyway.",0
Movie started out fast moving but bogged down.  If you did not see the first movie you may not enjoy this one.  I'm happy to have seen this but not so sure I would recommend.  Enjoyed the first movie much more.,1
"The movie content was as expected, but the Amazon service quality was very poor. The video had to buffer several times and I was asked if I wanted to switch to the SD versions, which is unacceptable when I paid for the HD version. The problem was not with my ISP or with my network (as Amazon implied in an email about this issue) as I was able to stream video from many different websites to other devices/televisions without any service degradation. Therefore, the problem was with the Amazon server or the Amazon network. In the future, Amazon should reject any request to stream a movie if they do not have sufficient bandwidth to support all previously accepted streaming requests and the new request! They should also increase capacity to handle peak time streaming.<br /><br />Amazon automatically credited me (without me complaining to them) with the entire purchase a few days later (and is why I am not giving this just 1 star), which was a marginally resolution to this issue. However, with a paid Prime service, I expect better quality. I am okay with an error message stating that the facilities cannot support the streaming service at the moment before we begin watching the movie stream.",0
"I can rewind the techniques, but, showing a submission, at least 3 times and with different angles would be a better method of teaching.",0
What a piece of s***  Bought it because of the romance of Key West in the 70's  I guess you had to be there  Oh s*** I was there!  Nostalgically  Palm beach dude,0
"Nice time passer, not too bad.",0
"What a disappointment! The strong potential  - both comedic and dramatic - of this series concept is totally derailed by its degeneration into sophomoric and frankly embarrassing characters and plot. The fulcrum of the series - a middle aged father's coming out as transgendered - soars entirely due to the nuanced portrayal by the series' lead (who manages to transcend mostly wooden and inconsequential writing and hackneyed situations), but the rest of the story - yech! I'm not even Jewish and I was embarrassed and uncomfortable with the unrelenting stereotypes: the spoiled, greedy, lazy, narcissistic, over-sexed suburban kids, the shrill, whining, &#34;Have you met my wondahful son?&#34; mother (who unaccountably has a Brooklyn accent even though the whole family lives in So. California), the passive, over-intellectualized father. . . Are these scriptwriters so totally lacking in imagination that all they can give us are the characters and dialogue from a 1930s radio show? Tasteless, pathetic, and insulting.",0
If I had a class to teach I would show this film.,1
It sucks.,0
"I actually thought this came off pretty well, considering the enormous amount of computer graphics it took to make it.  The story was fairly good, though the acting a bit stilted at times.",0
"This movie isn't for everyone, and it certainly wasn't for us. Before spending an hour and a half on this, it would be a good idea to read the wikipedia article on it, and the Trivia section in imdb, which explain what's going on here. This is sort of the French equivalent of mumblecore. The author and his friends get together and play off each other (the film is not scripted). It's full of in-jokes, only one of which we happened to get (Houellebecq repeatedly reads Diderot's novel The Nun, which was the subject of an earlier film by the same director). If you're a big fan of Houellebecq, you'll probably &#34;get&#34; the movie, but we weren't and we didn't.",0
Highly anticipated viewing this movie and was more then a bit dissapointed. Movie never really got going...was anticipating much more action given advertising. Ending was odd as well.,0
My 1st grader chose this one after watching the preview. She didn't get all of the jokes but there was definitely enough that she got a good laugh out of. Fun family flick that shows monsters aren't so scary after all.,1
Intriguing right up until the end.  No ending!  It is as if they ran out if film!,0
"My sister lives just south of where most was filmed, so lots of things recognizable. Acting and story weak at best, but was a family story! No profanity....",0
Tries to cover too much material too quickly.  Seems to contain some factual errors according to other sources I consider reliable.,0
John Carter is one my favorite sci fi movies. Read the books as a kid. Disney did a great job with it.  Too bad it did not make a ton of money for them. I'd like to see them make more of Edgar's Mars series of books into sequel movies.,1
it is very confusing.,0
Very depressing,0
Great fun with twists and turns!,1
So far was good little changes compared to Walking Dead but can't give 5 stars on show until I see more episodes.,1
"The movie was made for special effects and, although good, needed more space battle scenes. This was definitely a 3.5 star movie for plot though.",1
Too easy to the point of stupid. Although made the plane ride go by but just mildly entertaining,0
This was raunchy and funny with songs that barley pass as songs.  They are lip synced anyway...LOL,1
"Should have made it known this is from the 1970's, not the current show on Masterpiece.",0
"&#34;Tijijiapan, I've been there&#34;.",1
Clearly one of my favorite movies. Brad Pitt is great as Benjamin.,1
Outstanding portrayal of Eone along with the intrigues of the time. The acting was outstanding. The costumes were beautiful. And over her life you watch as court fashion changed. Very very well done.,1
Just as good as the first one!!! love this sequel and definitely leaves room for part 3 - I hope they do make a 3rd one!,1
Amazing! Hope they bring this on for a full season.,1
"Seemed a little long, but overall a great movie",1
Sean Penn was awesome!  Loved it!,1
Funny,1
Good movie - brought back old memories.,1
The sreen size kept changing we could not watch it as half the picture went off screen.  Going to rent it elsewhere,0
My daughter loves this show,1
"Beautiful to watch, not a great story.",0
Hard to believe hbo has not shown this movie. However  the crap movies that hbo has been showing for years would have been over shined by this movie. It was good - not fantastic. It kept my attention. Amazon was the only way other than buying that I could have even watched it.,0
"Honestly, I only gave it a one because there was not any way to rate it lower.  I have seen some REALLY bad movies.  I think Divine would rate as an Emmy class performer in comparison to the part of the movie I could force myself to watch.",0
just an small piece of the show..,0
My daughter loves it and I've sadly seen it with her about 5x so far.,1
"Fun horror.  The best kind, in that you are scared but feel okay because of the laughter and the whole not taking demonic forces too seriously.  I think the end could have had more of a punch than just the gotcha,  because of the most horrible part of the film....The catacombs...were underuitilized. But still,  the film is a lot of fun and Dark Vision 2, The Darker Vision, will be even more fun!",1
"The movie did not have the block buster movie feel. It played as a B rated movie. The dialog wasn't there,  you didn't feel invested in the character's. The bad guy and reborn good guy needed more acton scenes of why and who they are.",0
Doesn't even deserve the one star. (wont let me do less)<br />I believe the people that must have reviewed so highly must be fakes.,0
"Well told story about a tragic life...I appreciated that they did include everyone's point of view, even the deluded parents. It was the epitome of irresponsibility and recklessness to go off without even the proper attire and rations, so expecting to leave there alive was delusional, but in a family like his I can kind of understand. I feel for his sister, being accused of airing her family dirty laundry for fame or money...if she was going to do that it would have been back when they made the film, certainly not now. In my opinion she may be trying to explain why he wanted to disappear in hopes that the droves of idiots following in his romanticized footsteps, ending up maimed or dead, may stop. All of the children of this man are damaged by his behavior, and like his sister said, they are all survivors...except Chris.",1
Very cute. But not for children! Could be pretty scary!,1
"You have to get past the over-acted dubbed American English voices and it may be a cute movie for some kids, but even our 8 yr old grandson found it unbelievable and silly.",0
This is by far my favorite new series. I really hope it gets renewed.,1
Terrible movie!! Weird and disturbing... Waste of money and time! Couldn't even sit thru half of it!,0
good,0
I love this movie. I hope that hemp becomes a lawful plant in America. I liked the part where the Indians at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation tried to grow hemp. The  DEA thried to thwart the Indians. I would like to see this agency closed down as soon as possible.,1
Light hearted and good,1
Love it.,1
"Extremely poor quality video, zero info unless you are a clueless tourist from the moon, the music is beyond annoying. I'm a Prime Member and didn't have to pay for this, or else I'd be VERY angry. Being from Colorado, I spend a lot of time in this part of the country and I'm baffled at how they managed to turn this gorgeous landscape into a boring &#34;documentary.&#34;",0
"This movie isn't great, but it was fun to watch..The special affects are all computer animation, not great, but I've seen a lot worse, I laughed through most of this movie. I did find it entertaining, If you don't go in thinking like Independence Day effects, or acting, you should get a kick out of it...",0
"Yes, a little cheesy and low tech by today's standards, but that's just it - this was wildly creative an innovative for the day and set the path for many similar shows and movies to follow.  I...can't image......not..giving it five....stars.  Stardate 201508",1
Best show ever given Empire a run for its money,1
"The Best Short Film I have ever saw.<br />María’s routine at school is altered by the arrival of a very special child. Soon, they become close friends.<br />In my opinion ‘ Strings’ or 'Cuerdas' is a short film written and directed by Pedro Solís García. ‘Strings’ was the 2014 winner of the the Goya ® award for ‘the Best Spanish short film animation’. Pedro Solís García was also awarded with the same prize in 2011 for his first short &#34; The Bruxa &#34;.<br />  The film is full of nuances and describes a tender story of friendship between two special children. ‘Strings’ also speaks of values ​​and illusions and it is able to captivate the viewer from the first frame and the first musical note to the end of the film credits.<br />  The rating of the new short film by Pedro Solis is ‘for all ages and special interest to children’. The Spanish Ministry of Culture has recommended ‘Strings’ for its educational vocation.<br />  &#34;It is a round piece of art that grows up every time that you watch it.&#34;",1
"If you have a quirky sense of humor and you like classic films, you'll enjoy this one.",1
allright.,0
Terrible!,0
Possibly the worst film I've ever seen. There is no hope for the future.,0
It's an okay movie. Lots of fuss.,0
One guy talking to the camera and spouting nonsense. I couldn't take any more of it after about 10 minutes.,0
great movie.  very powerful and emotional.  not full of killing like other typical battle movies.,1
I love this show!! It brings back so many great memories of my younger days!! It is so nice to still be able to see it anytime I want. I would recommend it to anyone!!,1
Excellent,1
"Smart and twisty, VERY Altman! The dated aspect only makes it more literate.",1
Typical story lines and events.  Boring horror,0
"Not great, but worth the time. It was enjoyable. I liked Robert De Niro's character a lot.<br />I thought the title was a little strange in that [SPOILER ALERT] not everybody is fine: One is dead.<br />Everybody else is fine, and in terms of movie plot and happy closing scene, maybe that's close enough.",1
"I don't think this was a comedy, but this really was sweet and confusing at the same time.",1
"Seriously mediocre compared to The Walking Dead. I've only seen the first episode so far, but I am just not impressed. There aren't any characters that I would root for, not at all like the characters on TWD, where you connected with the characters right away. The casting is odd, the actors lack luster, the story line lagged, need I go on? I'm  hoping the second episode will redeem the first. Just saying.",0
My kids and I LOVE this show.  What a wonderful show.  The lead character is female and if that wasn't wonderful enough she is super smart.  There are so few show or movies these days in which women much less girls have the lead role.  I am so pleased that Amazon has this superb show available for my daughter to watch.  I am also pleased that they work science and science vocabulary into a fun show for kids.  So glad we found this.  Hope others will find it and share it with all of the young girls in your lives.  We need to help girls realize how smart they are and that science and math are just as approachable for them as for the boys.,1
Good movie for a Sunday afternoon,0
Intense,1
This movie was worse than having your eyes removed and surgically inserted into your butt. I thought Chamming Tate was super hot but the director must have eaten a bunch of scrabble pieces and then expelled them onto paper as a script then given it to him to read. An unmitigated cinematic disaster.,0
Good story line and a little creepy.,1
"Ultimately unwatchable due to quirky, &#34;not quite there&#34; personality of protagonist.",0
"I assumed this would be generic and meh but it turns out Tatum can really dance, and dance he did.<br />Funny, a little dramatic, a lot less cheesy than I thought, and a nice change to the boobs and butt male dominated movies we are used. to.",1
awful..waste of brain cells,0
Not really worth watching if you're a Mad Max fan.,0
"I couldn't even get more than 10 mins into the 1st episode.  The swearing was so excessive, that I had to turn it off",0
Just not a good movie.,0
GREAT,1
Very good story and acting. Well directed as well,1
"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?",0
every time i heard a note from the great stained class lp.<br />ps. if music can make you suicide; you have much larger problems.<br /><br />PRIEST!\m/,0
I love it.I never cried watching a movie in years but I did with Winter's Tale....good story line but could of done more with the details,1
An interesting telling of the emperor Nero though I did not like the major historical changes that they made to his story to enjoy the plot. Though it does show the problems between Nero and Agrippina it does not truly show how his mother was dispatched. Overall it was fine but the inaccuracies made it not as good as it could have been.,0
This was a low budget &#34;mockumentary&#34; so I have to give everyone involved a standing ovation for a finished product worthy of a friday evening movie night with some wine and cheese!,1
Keeps getting better,1
"A good movie very entertaining the book of course being much better, Bram stoker was truly a great writer and his book &#34;Jewell of the seven stars&#34; that the movie was made from was fantastic.  Enjoy the movie, I did.",1
Good movie.,1
Where is Mel Gibson or at least a personality for Max!<br />This movie is a stinker!,0

AWESOME,1
No visuals. 100% dialog and stock still images of Roman &#34;Stuff&#34;,0
Far too graphic  Some would give that a 5 star,0
"Was ok, not really a fan of the way jeff bridges talks in this.",0
"One star is overating this movie. If you don't want your brain to glaze over, please look for another title to watch,",0
"So cute, funny & loved seeing Alex Morgan in there! I think this is a great clean show!! Acting was great. Please make more than 1 episode :)",1
"The kids watched this 3 times in a day, they really loved it.. I liked it, too. Nothing like a good kids, animated movie that don't get on the parents nerves, haha.",1
Awesome show,1
Funny but dorky,0
"I have watched every episode of this very adult and good horror series.  This season was different than the first two because it was basically a lead in to the red dragon story.  Which will end the series on a high note. Personally I would love to see this show continue. But you must be thankful for NBC for allowing it to exist for this long!.  It was unlike anything that's ever been on tv and it will be missed by many.  This episode which I bought really take you into the red dragons mindset and we see his interaction with the monstrous Hannibal here as well.  This show has such outstanding actors that it elevates the activities each week above most shows as well.  OF course , if you haven't watched this show , then start at the beginning and move forward. to this fine episode , one of the last of a truly great ADULT ONLY shows.",1
Get the REAL story; don't hesitate. It was pleasant to see that this wasn't a hatchet job against Obama but a true background piece.  If you really want to &#34;know him&#34; buy it.  IF you want to live in some kind of fantasy world; don't.,1
"I have been to the burned down shell of the site.  The Urban Legend is much better.  Poorly made movie.  Acting, environment. Poor storylines.  Waste of a great Urban Legend.",0
"Only covers the beginning to the motorcycle accident. If you're a fan, you've seen, read, or heard 90% of it before. How many times you wanna hear that being booed at the Newport Folk Festival for going electric story. Only new part for me was how long the negative reaction to going electric lasted. Listening to those alleged fans criticize songs from Highway 61 was unpleasantly absurd. How can you say stuff like that about songs from the greatest album ever made?<br /><br />If you're a new fan, good introductory overview of the beginning.",0
Great acting. Beautiful scenery.,1
"I did so want to like this film, but alas, it's malformed, erroneous and overlong.  Some scenes are wonderful, but others including a strange tank ballet at the end don't work.  Likewise the envelope story of Russian Aid worked helping earthquake victims is unnecessary and confusion.  Company 9 was ever so much better.  Enemy at the Gates is a better film about Stalingrad, as is the eponymous German film.  Soviet era films about Stalingrad have their own issues, although a few are good.  In any case, this film is of varied quality, and I have to say I'm sorry I bought it for 14.99.",0
"Not as great as I'd hoped.  Some of the actors were wonderful (Tut) but others seemed downright ridiculous.  Could've been so much better, but I did like the story line, however fictional it may have been.",0
The quality of the video is poor and we haven't even been able to watch the whole movie. Every 30-45 seconds the screen pauses or goes black then has to refresh.,0
"The plot had potential, but it was just weird and disgusting.",0
"The part of this movie I enjoyed the best was the frame that showed &#34;The End.&#34; Probably the worst cinematography I have seen, Instead of shooting a B&W or a color film they used color filters and lighting that made it almost impossible to see what was going on, if anything. Just a bad effort all around: story, sound (the background music is awful), lighting, acting. You name it but do not bother to see it.",0
"I couldn't finish the series. I normally love these kinds of reality shows but this one is too fake and overly dramatized. At its core, the concept is neat; I just stopped looking forward to new episodes.",0
Lots of credibility holes in the story. But ot was well acted and is family friendly entertainment. I think tweener girls would enjoy this movie and parents would not find it objectionable.,0
With the fastest internet available in uptown Houston and the Smart TV wired into the router I ALWAYS have a quality issue when rewinding. It takes about 3-5 minutes to stream full HD quality. This does not happen with Netflix or Vudu.  I purchased all of my movies through Amazon but I'm seriously considering purchasing through Vudu,0
"Awful, big waste of money to rent it!",0
This movie is pretty good . It could have been better ending.,1
Better if you know the source material but I thought the humor fell flat... and i love these actors,0
Awesome movie. Miss meadows character depicts a strong femininity largely missing from today's culture. Fresh enjoyable.,1
Love this movie and series!,1
"Had no idea what this was about but gave it a chance.  Being Scots-Irish in my heritage and, I thought, fairly tuned into my heritage, I was surprised to have never heard of this aspect of our history.  I can now better see why the older folk in my family were so anti-English and with such good cause. Story about a little known social conflict in Scottish history that deserves being more widely known.",0
It has more sad and plain out stupid part for than funny. I found it a struggle to finish it and when I did I found myself thinking why didn't I just stop it? So I would not recommend it but do as you will.,0
"Was REALLY disappointed in this movie.  It just didn't have any redeeming qualities in my opinion.  It could have at least been cute.  But it was just verbally crude in so many ways and ridiculous - again, in my opinion. SPOILER - The only good thing was the Julia Roberts didn't get the guy in the end, but she did have a good friend there to support her.  Her character was horrible and I would have disliked the movie even more if she would have won her love interest.",0
"I enjoyed watching this mini series.  The acting and pace of this movie kept my interest.  In conclusion, &#34;Hindenburg:The Last Flight Season&#34;, while not a classic movie is still entertaining and worth viewing.",1
BAD.,0
"Excellent movie.  Sometimes it ticks you off, then it turns around and makes you feel warm all over.  Two people with totally different outlooks on life find each other in a most unusual way.  The rest of the movie is them moving closer and further apart and then at the end, a nice twist to wrap things up.",1
Very engaging.,1
Funny but the problems faced were real. Enjoyed the courage these women had,1
"Let's see...target audience:  Children.  Then why the need for name calling, &#34;stupid.&#34;  It didn't add anything to the film, but it did subtract from a library.  Deleted!",0
"Incredibly well done! Informative and generous. Will bring tears to your eyes, and if it doesn't than you may want to check your pulse. Thank you! #BeTransparent",1
Far better than I thought it would be. Worth a viewing.,1
I love this show I started watching it a few years ago but never got to finish it.,1
Very funny and clever.,1
"It was horrible, I kept waiting for it to get better. Don't do it.",0
The movie is great.  There were times when the picture was quite fuzzy.,1
"It was a really good movie,really enjoyed it. I don't know what else to say expect I think everyone should watch it haha, I really enjoyed it it was packed with action which is great, I was so excited to rent this movie and I'm really happy I did, and amazon made it super easy to rent it.glad I got it on here instead of red box.",1
Starts out pretty good but gets really silly and soap-opera like the last 2 or 3 episodes.  I won't be watching season 2 because I do not care about the characters anymore.,0
You have got to be kidding me.  This is horrible in every single way.  It does not even deserve one star.,0
"Sebastian Maniscalco's standup makes me laugh out loud. Cutting provolone with a very sharp toe nail. Who thinks of that? He's a riot.  Maniscalco has managed to make being old-school Italian and OCD very funny. His facial expressions, gestures and everyday observations about life are simply hilarious. That mouth. No, I don't appreciate the expletives. But they're few and far between. He's so much funnier them. A good show.",1
Much better than I thought it would be..(from the previews)...great family movie!,1
Not up to the standard one would expect from most BBC series.,0
"A must watch for all, this provides some very good and specific data missing from other like films.",1
Worst movie ever!<br />Turned it off!,0
Okay but a little disconcerting.,0
"rather misleading title and description on this one. the real description should say over an hour of people telling ghost stories. The camera work looks like late 80's early 90's style film. The only upside is it is free on Amazon Prime, but I will say that there are lot better paranormal shows out there that might not be free, but you will make all the way through to the end without stopping to write a negative review halfway through the film in the hopes of saving someone else from watching it.",0
"I couldn't imagine a spin-off to stand on it's own, but Bob Odenkirk is a great actor. He made Saul his own character on the original show and he carries that same persona on Better call Saul. I love the way he seems mystified about happenings around him but then quickly adapts and uses the situation to his advantage.",1
"Riveting, holds the attention, Can't wait for the episodes. Clever acting with strong characters and structured plot/",1
Cute movie,1
"Exceptional documentary. Maureen the therapist is a  loving, caring, and dedicated therapist. The two subjects allowed themselves to be filmed in particularly difficult situations. You are a third person participant that is along for the adventure in sexual healing. You will enjoy this from beginning to end and it is done with great taste. Yes, it is the story of sex.",1
"If you read the book, don't waste your time with the movie, it does not resemble the Hobbit at all.  Made up characters, dwarf elf romances, and typical hollywood plot degradation.  Actors are great but I wish they would make a movie that sticks to the book.",0
Interesting!,1
Great story line,1
"It was almost 20 minutes before anything started happening.  This video and the exercises are just too slow moving for me, I guess I'm not old enough.  And you cannot return instant video, bummer.... Didn't watch the whole thing, deleting.",0
"Ken Burns may just be the greatest documentary film maker ever, and of all his wonderful documentaries, three stand out from all the rest.  In no particular order, they are Baseball, The Civil War, and Jazz.  There was a time when baseball really was the national past time.  Almost every town and hamlet in America had at least one adult team and countless youth teams.  It was played in back yards, back alleys, streets, parks, pastures, and on dedicated baseball fields.  No sports hero in the USA has ever approached much less surpassed Babe Ruth.  Millions of us still admire Honus Wagner, Rogers Hornsby, Lou Gehrig, Stan Musial, Ted William, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Mickey Mantle, Roberto Clemente, Frank Robinson, and Hark Aaron, and this includes people who are too young to have ever seen them play.  Baseball is a beautiful game and this is a beautiful film.  It is incredibly good, and the interviews with Buck O'Neil are priceless.",1
Excellent! very realistic with great acting by all.,1
"Aaron Eckhart is a believable action hero in a movie that could have given him more to work with. The storyline has been used before, and the title is very similar to the 1996 Arnold Schwarzeneggar/Vanessa Williams movie, which I actually enjoyed more. However, Eckhart holds his own and tries his best to keep this movie from going off the rails.",0
"Liam is an awesome young man. He rose up like a Phoenix, through healthy eating and exercise, to be the best knows he can be.  He wasn't sure of himself before, turning confident after.  A heart-moving story that people of all ages can watch.  I am so proud of him.",1
Slow moving storyline. Focused on stereotypes. But over all a clean and decent movie.,0
This made me really sad as I love Robert Duvall. This movie was kind of a meandering stream that really went nowhere.,0
"If you are a Viking reenactor or enthusiast I have some advice for you, do not waste your time or money. This film is a complete joke! Within 5 minutes I knew I had made a mistake renting it.  The story line is predictable and boring. The costumes are completely fantasy based, and dont resemble anything even near to the time period potrayed. Everyone involved in this film needs to reevaluate what their goals are in the entertainment business and start over!",0
"Dragon picture was so amateur, used to latest images enhanced more realistic.",0
"Quite enjoyable. Sit back, relax and enjoy the characters. There will be no trauma. It's funny.",1
"Awesome movie. Sure there were some unlikely events and possible historical inaccuracies, but the movie itself had a great plot and characters. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the main character. Definitely will watch again!",1
"Spoiler alert!!!!!!<br />Wanted to see romance between Elliot and Danner. That is a miss in this movie. The pool man has more camera time than Elliot.<br />2 dates and he is ready to marry? Then, BAM, gone!<br />This was slow, never got a true sense of true feelings and just bounced around! Not worth the money!",0
"I had an idea of what this would be but I was bored and had some time to fill. While some of the acting was slightly better than I expected, most of it is horrible.<br /><br />The multiple story lines are unsensible and confusingly random. People show up for no reason. You don't know who they are and you have no reason to care.<br /><br />If you need this kind of stuff, just go see a bad play at a local church.",0
A fantastic film with an interesting soundtrack. An entity follows it's victims. Very creepy. Jay is the protagonist that has this unfortunate curse fall on her and she must do  whatever she can to survive. Great cast. I recommend this.,1
It had too much bad language in it.,0
The best,1
We loved this movie so much - we watched it twice. We now own a copy for future enjoyment.,1
"Good, unique move. Great performances all around.",1
"love this show,  didn't think i would, but i did",1
I am a Mad Max Trilogy Fan.  Always have been.  This film is an absolute insult to Mel Gibson and the Mad Max Trilogy.  Since Charlize Theron is the star they really should have changed the title to 'Mad Maxine'.  What a shame because Tom Hardy would have shined IF he had been the main character.  This is another Hollywood shot at making women superior and men somewhat 'helpful' when the shiza hits the fan.  IF you prepare yourself mentally for this massive deviation from the Original Trilogy the movie rocks with some incredibly violent scenes and state of the art digital photography and computer generated graphics.,0
Interesting movie.  Enjoyed watching with nice and Girl Friend.,1
Loved it! Well acted and a great message.,1
this documentary was nice to put the kids to sleep but it was full of misinformation and promoted radical theories as scientific facts,0
Interesting film about beekeeping in the city!,1
"one of my favourite new shows. i love these bears to death. hilarious writing, very endearing characters, adorable animation, very catchy music. what more could you want?",1
"A good start, but a pat ending. Fun, though.",0
Nice little series to watch,1
"This was a great low budget film.  If you don't mind cheap sound and special effects, definitely give this movie a try.  The acting is decent, and though its rather predictable (what movie isn't, really?), its good to see a horror movie that relies on context and environment cues to give the audience the creeps, rather than slash and gore cheap thrills.  If you're looking to pass an hour an a half with a decent movie, check this out.",1
"Despite having a rather slow start, the movie is extremely enjoyable.  It has an excellent premise, intricate architecture, and an ominous soundtrack that makes even the most mundane scenes more intense than they should be.",1
"This is a quite unique film with its multiple twists and turns. Just when you think you're getting your mind around the characters and plot, the film mutates, along with your perception of the characters, which removes this movie from being buttonholed into any conventional genre. For instance, the movie opens during the Troubles with what appears to be a happy couple at a local fair in Northern Ireland being stalked by a creepy-looking man, and the next thing you know, you're in the middle of a political kidnapping. The movie soon becomes dominated by dialogues between the captive (a reluctant British soldier, named Fergus) and one of the several IRA captors (Jody), interspersed with cameos of the other captors, during which the two develop a bond that uproots both their lives, as they all await a response to the kidnappers' ultimatum.<br /><br />After the first third of the movie, the scene changes to London for the remainder of the film, to where Jody has fled following the kidnapping's denouement. Finding employment as a construction worker, Jody begins to search out the individuals close to Fergus, leading to an intimate relationship developing with Fergus' former love interest (Dil) punctuated throughout by multiple unexpected convolutions, which is then complicated even further when two of Jody's IRA confederates track him down to enlist him in an assassination plot. The movie races to its satisfying conclusion, with Jody and Dil forced to confront their prior lives and making difficult choices about their loyalties, responsibilities, and their future, individually and together.<br /><br />Indeed, the strength of the film lies in the interactions between the major characters and the unforeseen impact on their lives and how they view themselves. Strong acting fleshes out the principal characters into complex individuals, rather than stereotypes that they so easily could have become. These positives prevail over a plot line that at times wobbles (but never topples over) with unlikely and implausible happenings and that also seems to bifurcate into distinct Ireland and London narratives that don't form a very close union with each other (perhaps an ironic reflection of the political divisions of that era).<br /><br />I found this film while browsing in a local library and was intrigued by the cover description, but what I got was far greater than I expected. It's a film definitely worth seeing that will likely challenge assumptions you have made about life.",1
"2-stars is the fairest rating.  Manu is a coati.  I thought it was a type of monkey, but it's a relative of the raccoon that lives in Central & South America.  He by his nature gets into trouble and gets exiled.  Sacha, also a coati, is his friend/sorta girlfriend and also princess of the tribe.  She goes looking for Manu and is captured by poachers.  The story goes on from there and has a moral of accepting others as they are.<br /><br />Pro's:  Eh, It wasn't horrible.<br /><br />Cons:  The cheap looking animation style.<br />  The really simplistic dialog of the script.",0
"I was most pleasantly surprised.  I was led to believe that it was mainly a historical movie about my hometown, Albany, NY.  It was filmaed in  here, but it was a story of what people went through during that time, anywhere.  It is a great movie and worth watching.",1
Long drawn out and boring British film.,0
Rather slow.  Didn't have enough action to keep my attention. No wont watch any more episodes,0
I wish it was a way to skip the commentary by the time the actual film started my daughter lost interest. Not really what I expected from the previews.,0
"Not as good as the first one, but hey, who doesn't like seeing all these fine actors in one spot again...?  But the addition of Richard Gere to this cast line up... all I can say is &#34;meh&#34; for his performance, but he at least created a new story line to have these actors follow.  His character just not as believable, or sincere, but the movie concept is still good.  I think this would make a good series instead.  Keep rotating the basic core characters, but bring in and out guest appearances who have different adventures while at the hotel.  Make it about AGING GRACEFULLY!",1
Entertaining movie. Easy to watch.,1
This has many stories which would be good movies on their own.,1
"What can one say about God’s Not Dead without getting shellacked as hating on either the religious or the atheists?  I just really thought that Gods Not Dead was a horrendously awful movie. In the first place, it should definitely not be classified as a children’s film. Moving to more substantive matters, I think a real Christian [not the many people who claim God when doing so is convenient for them] would be offended by this movie. The message coming from this film seems to be “If you don’t believe in God, you’re a moron.”<br /><br />I cannot think of a more cruel message to send and actually undercuts the message of faith, hope, and love of all the Christians I know. That doesn’t mean that you love only those who share your worldview, but everyone regardless of where you find them in life. I actually hated the tone of the entire movie, in the first half, Christians are belittled for believing in God, and then it does this 180 and by the end, if you don’t believe in God, you’re severely lacking.<br /><br />Decisions about religious faith are very complex and personal things and it felt like this movie just trivialized that for really everybody. Coupled with the fact that no philosophy prof. I have ever met would engage in such a way on the God question just really make this an unbelievable movie designed to forward a pro-religion agenda. If you looking for a meaningful discussion of the religion verses atheist debate, look elsewhere.",0
I absolutely loved this movie! The message about God's love and grace! I would love if you could have a bigger collection of Christian movies!,1
Hi,0
Too short and left a lot out.,0
"Okay, so I'm an older person who has hearing issues :(  I need my entertainment in English.  My husband has similar issues, no, his hearing is worse actually.  He definitely needs his movies done entirely in English.  I understand the desire for realism but it cost them a good review from us.  Needless to say, we didn't watch but maybe 20 minutes of this movie and then gave up.",0
"this movie was such a mess that even claire danes couldn't save it. much of the dialogue made no logical sense, coming out of nowhere or changing  topic in ludicrous ways. lucy's  father come home and she inexplicably launches into a story about a boy she was forced(?) to kiss months ago. when he gets mad, her mother thinks he knows about the affair she's had, but lucy jumps in and claims she'd told him about the mother's secret job...but she hadn't and he doesn't even seem confused.<br /><br />the messages on teen sex are schizophrenic. lucy is raped but it's never called rape or dealt with in a way that reflects the seriousness of it.  we get a scene where lucy is blaming herself and nothing to counter that impression. her father turns from normal, traditional guy to a maniac who threatens a neighbor kid, slaps his daughter and recounts he virtues of a woman who would roast in a firey pit before sacrificing her virginity. her mother ends the movie by abandoning her daughter in a restaurant while she goes off with  her high school boyfriend. but it's ok cuz lucy gives permission and she gets to make eggs for the restaurant owner which somehow relates to he dream of being a chef.",0
it was horrible.. i don't mind crude but this was just ridiculous and stupid.,0
"At the 58:10 point in the film, you can see the boom mic in frame.",0
A very moving look at just how courrpt the flower business is.I had no idea. But somehow I always felt buying flowers was wrong and now I know why. God bless all those people that risked everything to come forward and tell their story. So sad.I will NEVER buy flowers again.It has far reaching impacts that can't even be imagined.,1
"received in timely manner, DVD was great",1
stop watch after first show not my style of show to watch.,0
Love the actors and as a love story about 'space nerds' it would have been ok. But the Bill Murray take over the world plot was ridiculous and unnecessary. Tried to be too many things to too many people....,0
Love it,1
Not near as good as one.,0
"Cute idea, music overpowers the answers.  It is as advertised, star answers to fan questions from social media.  The complainers that this did nothing to raise interest should first read what's going on, the watch again with open mind.  My complaint was that it was hard to HEAR the actors over the music.",0
"Good family show, with no real adult undertones.",1
Liked it sorry they aren't going to continue it,1
Really enjoyed this and wished they would have continued the series.,1
Ok,0
"It's almost like the movie is meant to make a strong statement about cyber-bullying but never quite gets around to doing it.  So we end up with something more akin to one of the &#34;Scary Movies&#34;, made worse because they're actually trying to be serious.<br /><br />It's another one of those &#34;perspective&#34; scary movies like Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity.  I guess the idea is that capturing imperfections such as internet buffering or a lower def home camera adds to the effect?  Well, the edited in buffering on this movie gets old in the end.  Mix that with some bad teenager acting and you get Unfriended.",0
Not as good as the first one in my opinion.,1
"Hate it.  Hate the characters, hate the pacing, hate the narcissism.<br /><br />The Walking Dead drips with humanity; Fear the Walking Dead has characters I pray to be eaten, in the goriest way.<br /><br />The son is vapid loser trash; he's no Carl.  The daughter is a self absorbed LA bimbo.  The wife is abrasive and just plain unpleasant; the husband tepid and ineffectual.  Please, please die horrible deaths.<br /><br />Fifteens+ minutes of the son in his hospital bed.  Really?  I squirmed in my seat waiting for something to happen.  Finally, something did happen; I turned it off half way through.  Did I miss anything?  Doubtful.<br /><br />The narcissism of Kirkman, AMC, and others to believe they could pull this off.  Typical corporate think.  If one thing is good, two things must be twice as good.  Just because one can do something doesn't mean that thing should be done.  The last time I felt so angry about a show was after sitting through Aliens 3.  I worry that this show will diminish, by association, the brilliant Walking Dead.<br /><br />BTW - I'm not just saying this because I am a zombie.",0
"Read the book first and was excited to see the movie.  Was very,very disappointed",0
Very good it was nice to see what happened to Kurt Cobain really makes you think,1
really thin pollen,0
season 3 was way to gruesome for my taste. l like the story in season 1&2 but it's not worth watching now.,0
Good movie,1
"This is the biggest crock of s*** I've ever seen marketed to paranoid American housewives. Reminiscences of duct tape and plastic sheeting, ICBMs from countries who can't build a tractor, and a fearful agent of contest federal paranoia. Who made ISIS. Us. Who made the \\""database\\"" of mujahadeen fighters that became turned into \\""the base\\"" (al qaeda). Wanna worship your fear like a golden calf? Watch this series.",0
Video didn't play on my Kindle Fire,0
"It was entertaining, but still... As a long time (but not hardcore) Trekkie I thought this lacked imagination.  Clearly a reboot of Wrath of Kahn with a few 180's on the original plot.  I found this film to be predictable to the point where I was telling my cat what was going to happen next.  This was a disappointment since I found the first JJ Abrams Star Trek to be a great flick.  You can't rely on special effects and animation to make a movie.  Still need an original story and some imagination.",0
totally tacky sci fi. expect nothing more.,0
"This movie is filled with cliche &  black and white characters. If you enjoy watching emotionally-abusive men yell at people, you're sure to love this movie. The good news is that the women are not forced to dress like whores or engage in whorish behavior, and that's a great advancement from HBO-type of programming. I hope the creators of this type of content continue to expand and increase the sophistication level of their scripts.",0
"Scary, but true story claims may b false",1
Great horror film! Very unsettling and disturbing.,1
Larry David is a genius and in some ways this show is even funnier than Seinfeld (and I loved Seinfeld). This is the most unusual and strange idea for a series:  a kind of pseudo reality show about his own life: how a very wealthy writer who could disappear to a Caribbean island forever if he wanted instead leads a somewhat normal celebrity life in Los Angeles. He can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth for five seconds and all of his good intentions seem bent on destroying every relationship he's ever had (or ever will have). Very funny. My kind of show.,1
Disappointing and silly premise. Not worthy of the great original series.,0
"It begins as if it were a raunchy chickflic. As it develops, however, one finds between many funny scenes, an extremely well thought progression of developments which make nearly every character more complex and real that one would have expected. The finale achieved a wonderful unity, and then become even better with an unspoken background announcement.",1
"So richly informative! I have been wanting to watch a Ken Burns documentary for awhile and am so grateful they are available on Amazon Prime. Living in Oklahoma, I wanted so much to learn more about this pivotal time in our history. I've appreciated the in-depth look, not just at what it was like to live in that time, but all the factors that led up to the events. I had never heard most of the facts regarding how this disaster was man-made or what brought &#34;no man's land&#34; to that point. I really appreciate that this video gives first-hand accounts, focusing on real families and individuals and how they were personally affected by all that occurred. It gives a realistic, yet personal view of history while giving me the opportunity to truly consider what it must have been to live through something so devastating. Truly powerful. My one complaint is simply the length - but that &#34;complaint&#34; is meager, as it does not drag or seem needlessley lengthy. It takes awhile to get through, but there is a lot of information to cover.",1
Decent,0
"Waste of time, badly written, smug in the fact that between these &#34;friends involved in this garage project,&#34; they reinforced the illusion of each other's wit and talent.  I wrote a similar story although of a much higher quality years before.  My third-grade teacher greatly enjoyed it.",0
Not too bad. A little silly at times but overall good kids show.,1
very good,1
Best shark attack movie to date!,1
I wasn't expecting much from this film and the previews didn't help much. It didn't look like it had a story and the only thing I did know was it had action and old cars.<br /><br />I was very surprised. It had a story once you figured it out and it was indeed nonstop action.<br /><br />Small spoiler alert<br /><br />This wasn't really about mad max though. He was just a supporting actor. This was about the character portrayed by Charlize Theron. It was still very good and I am looking forward to the next one..,1
"Much better than I expected. I thought I knew something about both men. Turns out, I didn't.<br /><br />Excellent documentary. Five stars.",1
"I tried to like this, I really did...but Michal Mann...WHAT HAPPENED?! It looks like it was recorded straight to an HD hand held camcorder and the acting...ugh, everything is FLAT. Bummer.",0
Enjoyed watching it I am a nature lover and love to learn about all things connected so this was perfect.,1
What our men and women go through is unimaginable! What they see day to day is truly horrifying! They are called the best of the best because they are! I pray for the soldiers we have lost and their family's. I pray every soldier that comes home will fight evening harder to get help and be well....this you all deserve! From this small corner in Alabama...I say again THANK YOU!!!,1
"Wow. Please excuse my brevity, but I must warn everyone who thinks of renting this movie. Just say no.",0
Enjoyed the movie... Classic,1
"If you have studied ancient historical documents from Christian and nonChristian circles, this movie becomes a laughing stock. But if you haven't and are gullible for something a producer wants to sell you, then you'll fall for anything.",0
No episodes to watch!!!!!  Don't sell something you don't have!!,0
"This is not the actual show. It's just a preview of some behind-the-scenes footage (that is uninformative and worthless) posing as the first episode. If I were selling something that was so easily available online through less ethical methods, I would not be so cavalier about deceiving my customers.",0
Just as good as the radio program. Nice to be able to see them doing there &#34;schtick&#34;.,0
"Best thing to ever happen to TV!!!!  I used to be Field Training Officer for an industrial security firm. Our men and women were required to watch COPS in the training room every Saturday night as part of our ongoing improvement of knowledge base. During that six year period, our people prevented crimes, stopped crimes in progress, and saved lives. We owe a lot to this program, and the men and women of Law Enforcement. COPS fans are the greatest people on Earth!",1
"I enjoyed watching this movie because it involved one of the great hunts of the past century. I had read the book several years ago, and even though it was much better than the film, I still enjoyed watching this--that is as much as one can enjoy watching about the horrors of a ruthless, inhuman man.",1
One of the worst movies of the year.  A true zero.,0
Meh. Naturally the book is way better.,0
"I liked the movie very well but with most sequels, this one does not equal the entertainment factor in the first. I wish movies could include all of the events from the book from which it is based, especially for understanding characters and how they evolve. Despite deficiencies, it was enjoyable. It did a good job eliciting emotional responses from audiences.",1
I didn't like it because it didn't stay on target with the hacking....less drugs more hacking....,0
It shows the rise to power of Nero though there are historical inaccuracies with the plot and they do not show the true relationship between Nero and his mother Agrippina. Decent sword and sandals movie though there was no fighting involved so it was lacking in many regards. It does give an interesting plot and story angle to Nero,0
If you're a fan of the original be warned you might not like this.,0
"Thought this was going to be an exciting spy movie,  but it turned out to be valgur potty humor. Pretty stupid ending!! Colin Firth should know better than to stoop to this type of movie.",0
Loved it! It holds well to the theme. I'm hoping I won't see the student with the knife as a walker in the future! Good family line. I bought the season already.,1
Love it!,1
Boring. Poorly edited. Music that does not match the scene. Dialog that does not match the period.  Shallow characters.  Don't waste your time.,0
Better than expected,1
"I never heard of this film nor would I have known about it unless I had Amazon Prime but want to say I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of detail with regard to historic true locations, essence of the people &#34;la gente&#34;, power, magnitude of violence, indulgence, corruption, etc. Escobar's photo still to this day adorns many homes and businesses right next to Jesus in Medellin for the paisas loved him for what he gave. This film and the actors played it to the P.<br /><br />Like any history good or bad, its still history and Colombia has come a long way and is still making strides in the right direction. That said, I hate when a movie like this becomes some wana-b-gangstas how to guide.<br /><br />Go visit the actual towns if you want. Turbo is beautiful, as is Medellin. And when you are there go to the typical restaurants and places and ask them about things you think you know about Pablo Escobar to people who lived through Escobar. Im not selling you anything but airfare is dirt cheap to Medellin and other parts of the country right now and the dollar to pesos has never been stronger. Go see the beach in the movie. People there are quite friendly but be careful who you date. LOL!!!",1
"only 1 star, because 0 stars is not a choice...",0
A romantic concoction set in a different time having only the vaguest connection with the actual events that inspired it. Entertaining enough for what it is - a gruesome depiction of Stalin's Russis - but CitizenX which sticks closer to real history turns out to be a better and more chilling narrative even without the extravagant production values or big-name stars.,0
"Well acted -- especially Robin Williams and Ben Affleck, but I could have much better dealt with leaving out at least half (if not more) of the F-bombs -- they were not necessary to the story.",1
"Very heavily slanted to a particular worldview and religious approach without critical consideration given to other viewspoints. In fact, the facts on which archaeological and historical authorities base their conclusions are dismissed repeatedly by being ridiculed and described as being based only on previous beliefs without consideration for factual evidence. The film is also used to aggrandize the filmmaker and to suggest that he, an untrained amateur, is simply smarter and more insightful than those who have studied long and hard in the field. What the film suggests about how real archaeologists and historians work is simply wrong. I cannot recommend this film for anyone, especially those without sufficient educational background to view it critically.",0
Too much changing back and forth.,0
No Problems,0
Very enjoyable film.,1
"Quick Review: This is a top notch production. The apocalyptic story, script and acting is superb. The pretty Haley Lu Richardson is outstanding as the main character. So much is learned on survival through this movie.",1
"Great movie, better than the new version",1
Boring,0
"A refreshing little love letter composed from an obvious horror fan to the rest of us, Cub expertly mashes together Lord of the Flies-like drama, survivalist thriller, and nostalgic late 70s/early 80s slasher into one (surprisingly) taut, cohesive whole. The solid acting, cinematography, gore, and slight social commentary perfectly fit this simple yet compelling story of bullying and social ostracization. There is not a moment of fat in the film, and we couldn’t take our eyes from it. As this is a fairly gory pic involving violence to (and at the hands of) young kids (and animals), some viewers may shirk, considering the concept taboo. But that’s one of horror’s many opportunities: to show us in graphic detail what we know happens in the world but which we refuse to speak of aloud. In the end, Cub is a horror movie for horror lovers, not unlike We Are Still Here, You’re Next, or House of the Devil. And for genre fans, it absolutely delivers in every way.",1
THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT A GIRL THAT USES A RIFLE TO INFLICT SUFFERING ON ON A MALE CAMEL. SO CRUEL IS SHE AND AN AMETEUR SHE SHOOTS THE POOR CAMEL MULTIPLE TIMES. THE MOVIE WANTS US TO APPLAUD THIS MONSTER. Anyone with a since of decency will turn this film off.,0
"Wow, horrible, horrible.  No where near the caliber of the original.  So disappointed.  I hope I can get a refund for the series.",0
I would have thought that this movie would have been much more thrilling but it was not.  I did enjoy it a bit but I don't think I could watch it again.,0
"Honestly, didn't expect much. Happily surprised, great action and in season 2 it gets even better.",1
so much fun. great soundtrack. had to buy it.,1
mediocre B horror flick,0
"Movie was decent. Neat filming style with Laptop background. I know they were going for accuracy, but the constant buffering of the videos in the movie was a little annoying.",0
"for how terrible the acting, make-up and camera work were, the movie was surprisingly watchable. i mean i finished it, which is the surprising part.",0
"Too cerebral and fallacious. You expect every scene to be a dream, gets really old after 20-30 minutes. I couldn't even watch this stoned.<br /><br />Special effects were cool, and there was an artistic element that I enjoyed. Would have been more enjoyable as a play.",0
"Better than I expected from Corolla -- maybe that's why I like this movie.  I'm not a fan of his.  But he pulls off a good performance and seems believable in the role.  Maybe a little too much self-referential material in the movie, but you really feel for the guy.  Yeah, it's predictable, but they get the most important thing right -- you really care about the character and what happens to him.  That's all I want from a movie like this.",1
"The movie's intention was awesome.  The lead character played by Brett Rickaby was very convincing.  That being said, the plot was somewhat difficult to follow because the film kept jumping from past to present events.  In addition, the volume was so low that I often had to rewind to listen to the dialogue.  Better lighting, and a a better production team would have gotten this movie four stars. Even with its flaws, I would recommend it.",0
"It doesn't even deserve one star. It's nothing but pornography with a superficial coating of Wall Street. If you left out the pornography, the story would be just another telling of an old story--not even an interesting one.",0
"Zombie-esque flicks with an arthouse vibe ala David Lynch or Jean Pierre Jeunet? Whoa. I didn't know I wanted to see that combo until I saw STILL. [Though technically, they're not Zombies. The strange affliction affecting residents of this small Pacific Northwest town is much more mysterious, and far more creepy than your standard Zombie fare]. Seriously, watch them all. They'll continue to grow on you and you'll be hooked. Even if you don't like standard zombie fare like Walking Dead or Z-Nation, though fans of those will dig this, too. It's off-beat, very stylized and often very funny when it's not scaring or creeping the pants off of you. As always with the most interesting shows, STILL's found a great balance between developing compelling characters inside a compelling plot. It's as much about how the characters react to what is going on around them as it is to the infection itself. And oh man, are there some twisted and interesting characters.",1
"I must say this is not one of Big Brothers better seasons. I usually connect with at least one person or a couple of people in the house. It took a long time for that happen this time, and even then it just doesn't seem as good as previous seasons. I kind of  think the BOTB has played out. And it also kind of sucks on more than one occasion I had to wait hours to watch an episode. I usually get them first thing the next morning after airing, and a few times I had to wait until late afternoon. Sometimes I find that annoying.",0
"Great movie, makes you think about what you should eat and how it effects ones health.",1
"A truly disturbing suggestion -- the United States divided between Japanese and Nazi rule. Chilling to see the oppressive presence of jack-booted Nazi soldiers patrolling the street of New York city looking for hints of subversive behavior from American citizens cast against the backdrop of the Swastika emblazoned on the Time Square jumbo-tron display. Juxtaposed with the decaying infrastructure of the Japanese occupied West (demarcated by the Rocky Mountain range) , the infused Japanese culture presents an other worldly quality very difficult to reconcile in ones mind.",0
"Pros<br />- beautiful cinematography<br />- nice acting<br />- compelling plot.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Unnecessary historical inaccuracies. The rape scene is a cheap shot.<br />- In every sex scene men are fully dressed while women are completely naked. It comes across more bias than realistic.<br />- Compared to some Netflix's Marco Polo, Casanova feels amateurish.",0
"LIke the first one, a wonderful cast and story. A little more confusing than the last one, but still worth a watch.",1
Incredible movie! Thought provoking! Especially for dads who want to make a difference in the lives of their families!,1
"My husband and I loved it. This is not your standard slasher flick. I love slasher flicks, but this is more of a slow burn with occasional jumps scares.",1
Very good and I would recommend watching this.,1
"this movie was so confusing I lost interest, very bad movie. I just wish you had a better selection of movies.",0
"It was a good and entertaining movie, but I am not sure I understood what it was about.  They explained, yet they didn't explain.  The participants didn't seem to understand what was going on real well either, but figured it out at the end.  The ending was poignant.",1
"Nothing new. Overly hyped. 1 maybe 2 of the deaths were decent and carried with creativity. Blumhouse green lighted a second one, will watch that just for the giggles.",0
OK,0
BORING!,0
Solid thriller.,1
Such a difficult way of life and yet these people only know difficult. And they seem to appreciate each day not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Very enlightening! Another way of life,1
Bad story and bad acting. A total waste of time and money. I was tricked by the number of stars the movie got. I guess I will have to do more research next time.,0
Love every season of this show!!  The height requirement being lifted is a great change!,1
"Not one of my favorite Spaghetti westerns.  I am a big fan of Terrence Hill, but this is not some of his best work.  His voice was also dubbed in this movie and that was a problem for me.  The story moved along slowly.  Not enough action.  I can not recommend.",0
It was horrible.  Way too much gore.,0
"This movie is visually stunning, and I find the story itself to be touching. The chemistry between Lee Pace and the girl hits the mark. Movies which I think are similarly fantastical and emotional in this way: The Princess Bride, Contact, and What Dreams May Come.",1
"PIRATE for the SEA is one of the best documentary films ever made, in my opinion. Paul Watson, the tireless environmentalist and protector of our oceans is a true hero. He's been making changes since he started in the 70&#34;s, first, with Greenpeace, but he splintered off to form the Sea Shepherds, which have truly made an impact on the whaling industry, most of all. He and his volunteers never stop. They don't know the meaning of the words, 'Giving up&#34; and thank God for all of them.<br />They've shown what their tenacity can do and have shown all of us some of the cowardly acts that some people do to make a living, like clubbing baby seals. I can't think of a more cowardly &#34;job&#34; than this, as it is perpetrated on these beautiful, defenseless, little snow seals that only want to live with their kind and flourish. What kind of person can be proud of such a &#34;job&#34;, which is only carried out like most things, the almighty dollar.<br />This film is well worth watching and breaks my heart. I hope it will spur on future activists like Paul Watson.",1
"More like 3.5. It lacked the humor of the previous Mad Max movies. Far, far too much chase, not enough character development. Very obviously made for 3d. Theron is such a good actor, but she isn't given the opportunity to show her skills. Too long.",1
Such a fantastic and well put together film!,1
This is what happens when Frank Darabont is not involved. So boring. Will not be watching any more of these.,0
"I am a female who picked the .movie for me and my husband.  We like concerts, crime,good sci-fi, Dog .movies. We do not like horror shows still haven't gotten over the Linda Blair Demon movie",1
Stupid unrealistic movie,0
"Despite all the glitz, glamour and pretty people I could only get through 40 min of this mediocre uninteresting characters Movie before I couldn't take anymore!!!!!!!",0
I  like romance comedies but this one was soooooo cheasy even for my taste.,0
Excellent story.  Highly recommend.,1
"Watched it with my teenage daughter. We both decided to go off processed sugar for a month afterwards. So far it's been easy. This film has raised our consciousnesses and motivated us to look a little closer at what we are putting inside our bodies. Have found lots of hidden sugar in our foods! An entertaining way to get an educational message across! The physiology described is limited but accurate, and easy to remember.",1
Outstanding horror flick; low budget first attempt that truly delivers.,1
"Cute movie :) my girls, ages 5 and 7 loved it.",1
"As usual, the BBC manages to do what American television cannot.  The Thick of It achieves the depth of storytelling, and character development, that shows like The West Wing lack.  A cast of characters that is at times clever, infuriating, hilarious, and completely human in their reactions.  I have to admit to being completely biased because of Peter Capaldi's involvement.  Malcolm Tucker is the perfect post-modern antihero.",1
Got bored very quickly,0
Excellent and worth watching more than once.  There is a lot to absorb.,1
Amazing movie that makes you rethink all you know about justice and morality. Love it 10/10.,1
Bad choice for 'me'... but that is just me...,0
"not a scary movie about stupid people. the premise is absurd. an affluent Manhattan couple own their apartment and can afford to send their 2 kids to a private school; in a city where parents will practically sell their souls and go to ridiculous lengths to get their kids into a good Manhattan private school; provided they can actually afford to do so.  One child nearly gets hit by a car and the parents go bonkers and start carrying on about how they have to get out of NY. Husband tells well paid corporate ladder climbing wife to take a leave of absence for a year; uh huh, likes they're really gonna hold that position open for her..........and like they're really going to take their kids out of an elite private school and send them to an upstate public school of.........lesser consequence.  somehow they're able to purchase a foreclosed estate, complete with baronial mansion (in excellent condition btw) , swimming pool, well over a thousand acres, the whole deal all for the low low price of $210,000. call now and well include a handy dandy weed whacker. I bet that property is worth between $3 to $5 million; no freakin way in upstate NY are you gonna touch a deal like that even in foreclosure for $210,000.00  the kids are smart, the parents are stupid, the wife is a completely clueless idiot. the painfully transparent low class, ex-con, conniving bs artist son of the previous owner worms his way into their home with great ease because the parents are incredibly stupid, but the kids are hip to his s***t and hate him.  father finally wakes up to reality and the con man quits knowing he'll get fired sooner than later. mother doesn't understand, maybe she's got the hots for bronzed, chiseled and sweaty pretty bad boys.  pretty boy is a dangerous psycho case of the first order and he's out to get this family because he feels the property is still his.  parents mishandle the entire situation from day one and get too chummy with the local tavern owners and play right into their hands.  this (obviously) does not end well.",0
I thought it was a fun movie. May-be a little long but entertaining. I liked it,1
Love it. Cannot wait to buy DVD. Love Armie Hammer,1
Informative in regards to alternate life styles.,0
