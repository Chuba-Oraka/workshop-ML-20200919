By episode 3, about 2 or 3 people in a position to do damage have seriously lost their !@#$ over this dome thing. We're only a couple days in and the panic of the crazy berserking/getting-people-killed kind has begun which seems a bit much given that the average person doesn't wander farther from home for more than a few miles for anything other than a commute to work more than once or twice a year. No doubt people would start acting up after 2-3 days without internet and electricity but the degree that some do is just a little too much repetition of Stephen King's damaged goods loose cannon boilerplate character.<br /><br />But the riots were the first serious nail for me. How much time has passed isn't entirely clear but I think we're still in the first week of being trapped in the dome when inevitable disaster hits and of all the places for that truck to veer off to in order to avoid hitting somebody, it takes a good 60 degree course correction that plants it directly in line with the town's water tower, whose base is apparently constructed from very thin sheets of tin. Okay, it's TV. I can handle that. What I can't handle is that by the end of the day or maybe the day after (time passage is often somewhat vague) the entire town is pretty much rioting over the water shortage. Okay, really? We're all out of juice boxes at this point? Only one person in town figures out that his lifelong frienemy has a well based on some old maps after the riots? Is it really that hard to separate methane from lake water? Was nobody in this entire small town in the country aware that methane water is actually perfectly drinkable?  While we're at it, of all the people to not get insulin, why didn't the medical center make damn sure the only doctor intown who just saved a crap-ton of people from meningitis got her share before she wandered off into the street while being surrounded by highly unobservant friends and family?<br /><br />And then episode 7 happens and the whole thing just faceplants into a catastrophic white hot mess of bad editing, horrible dialog, surprisingly weak acting from actors who were managing quite well up to this point and a messy mix of supposed heartwarmth and tragedy that feels mostly nonsensical, rushed, and full of drama money moments that were cliched and completely unearned. I no longer care what the dome is. I don't even care to hit the internet for spoilers. In the end I don't think I even liked the dog anymore and wanted them all to die.<br /><br />And I'm the kind of guy who can watch bad sci-fi movies just because I want to know what the thing was really all about in the end. You don't have to work that hard to keep me interested. Just don't embarrass yourself and keep me convinced that you actually are going somewhere better than Battlestar Galactica went with this and I'll keep ratcheting up that suspension of disbelief you keep dropping Buicks on.

This is one of those quiet films that gently eases itself into one's soul and remains there for a while. Emily Mortimer, Gerard Butler, and a young actor named Shona Auerbach deliver compelling performances that elevates this above a typical tearjerker.<br /><br />Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie Morrison, a single mother who at the beginning of the film is moving her family, which includes her mother and Lizzie's hearing-impaired 9-year-old son, Frankie (Shona Auerbach). Apparently, the family is always moving and the reasons are revealed earlier on in the film, though not with any specifics provided. Frankie settles into a routine at school - he is the target of nasty comments by some of his peers, but manages to make a good friend. Frankie loves geography and looks forward to receiving letters from his Da, a man Frankie has never met but who sends Frankie letters, describing travels on a ship named Accra.<br /><br />Early on in the film it is revealed that these letters are actually penned by Lizzie, who does not want Frankie to know the real truth about his Da. When the Accra is revealed to be docking at their seaside town, the school bully insists that Frankie show his Da off to the kids at school and Emily scrambles to find a total stranger who will step into the role. The man who picks up this assignment is none other than Gerard Butler, who plays a stranger who agrees to be Frankie's Da for a day or two.<br /><br />The film moves languidly against the backdrop of a bucolic coastal town. Yet there is also the undertone of menace simmering just below the surface - this is well-portrayed by the facial expressions and furtive body language of Emily Mortimer's Lizzie. Why is she hell bent on keeping up with the deception, and why is she so afraid of her past catching up with her? These questions are answered late into the film, but definitely worth the wait. There is a sense of the bittersweet here with an ending that left me feeling contemplative about the vagaries of human existence.h an ending that left me feeling contemplative about the vagaries of human existence.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,1

Just when you think you're getting your mind around the characters and plot, the film mutates, along with your perception of the characters, which removes this movie from being buttonholed into any conventional genre. For instance, the movie opens during the Troubles with what appears to be a happy couple at a local fair in Northern Ireland being stalked by a creepy-looking man, and the next thing you know, you're in the middle of a political kidnapping. The movie soon becomes dominated by dialogues between the captive (a reluctant British soldier, named Fergus) and one of the several IRA captors (Jody), interspersed with cameos of the other captors, during which the two develop a bond that uproots both their lives, as they all await a response to the kidnappers' ultimatum.<br /><br />After the first third of the movie, the scene changes to London for the remainder of the film, to where Jody has fled following the kidnapping's denouement. Finding employment as a construction worker, Jody begins to search out the individuals close to Fergus, leading to an intimate relationship developing with Fergus' former love interest (Dil) punctuated throughout by multiple unexpected convolutions, which is then complicated even further when two of Jody's IRA confederates track him down to enlist him in an assassination plot. The movie races to its satisfying conclusion, with Jody and Dil forced to confront their prior lives and making difficult choices about their loyalties, responsibilities, and their future, individually and together.<br /><br />Indeed, the strength of the film lies in the interactions between the major characters and the unforeseen impact on their lives and how they view themselves. Strong acting fleshes out the principal characters into complex individuals, rather than stereotypes that they so easily could have become. These positives prevail over a plot line that at times wobbles (but never topples over) with unlikely and implausible happenings and that also seems to bifurcate into distinct Ireland and London narratives that don't form a very close union with each other (perhaps an ironic reflection of the political divisions of that era).<br /><br />I found this film while browsing in a local library and was intrigued by the cover description, but what I got was far greater than I expected. It's a film definitely worth seeing that will likely challenge assumptions you have made about life.",2015-08-23,1.0,True,1

The Genetic Opera]]<br /><br />Unfortunately for all its promise,,,,star-studded cast, potentially brilliant premise, and what could be an arresting use of genre spanning visual artistry...Repo! The Genetic Opera simply never lives up to its potential.  All its elements are somehow handled with cement gloves when they could have been deftly woven into to something magnificent.  This movie gives TOO Much when it should gives less..as in CLICHES... and pulls back when it ought to Pour It ON...for example the bedroom rebellion scene with a punk rock motif featuring a totally wasted cameo by Joan Jett or Sarah Brightman's final scene which could have been epic and was a complete throw away musically, visually and plot-wise.  This movie cannot decide whether to be heavy on  a plot commenting and on modern society, genetics and corporate greed while  contrasting it with traditional Greek operatic tragic themes of family and betrayal using rock/goth music (which would be F'ing AWESOME)  or if it just wants to be a Tim Burton Flick with some Riddley Scott architecture and singing.  The plot references great, fascinating concepts and intriguing mysteries and then doesn't develop them or quickly resolves them i n a Scooby-Doo finish,  Character Develpment, in the form of key individuals &#34;story&#34;, is quick and doesn't develop empathy or relationships between characters as it reveals more fact than  feeling, The only real nod to the Rocky Horror picture show is the lingerie and passing reference to perversion, The only homage to Blade runner is setting and unexplored father/maker betrayal that woul'd've make an Epic movie if explored even a tiny bit more  There is no real emphasis on any specific genre or music so if you are expecting to fing something to Love be it opera, goth, techno, or rock...you wont,  The visuals are impressive but forgettable.  The acting is decent but not at all memorable. Sarah Brightman's role and talent are so tragically unused here!! The graverobber is the best character honestly. I really wanted to like this movie.  I was waiting for the grand song or point to make it come together for me.  The ending was the most unclimactic event since...well, it let's just say the entire effort was dismal and disappointing.

So she does what most 17 year olds do in that situation: she starts selling her body (saying she is 20) to a bunch of older men.  This is graphically portrayed and never, ever, is there any kind of safe sex used, including one scene where an old fellow demands an unprotected oral sex act.  Great.<br /><br />Magically, she doesn't get herpes, genital warts or worse and only runs into trouble when one of her oldsters dies &#34;in the act.&#34;  And, by the way, she has broken no law...she is the &#34;victim&#34; due to her age.<br /><br />She doesn't seem to regret the path she has chosen, even after counselors warn her that she could end up beaten, diseased and even dead. And no pimp tries to control her for jumping into &#34;his&#34; territory.<br /><br />And she doesn't really need the money.  Aside from all that, the film is sooooo realistic.  Be fun to screen it to a room full of &#34;sex workers&#34; and get their reactions!<br /><br />I think that what I dislike most about the plot is that there seems to be no real consequences to the actions of the young girl.  She even meets the wife of the gent who expired while she was servicing him and the wife expresses something about it being nice that he died happy. Hooking and unsafe sex is not a Nerf toy.  You can get hurt!<br /><br />So if you only want to see an attractive young French actor playing a jailbait hooker with plenty of T&A, here's a film for you.  Subtitles won't matter much.

In addition to being very informative, it is also done in a way that makes it interesting to viewers of all ages.<br /><br />  The first part of the episode teaches viewers about color, how it is seen and how it is broadcast for television (this was the first episode broadcast on NBC who were pushing hard to broadcast as many of there shows as possible in color.).  I also enjoyed Walt Disney telling how the studio embraced the technology of color film as soon as it was available.<br /><br />  The second part of the show stars Donald Duck as an explorer in Mathmagic Land who encounters The spirit Of Adventure who proceeds to show Donald that mathematics is an important part of everyday life and is in almost everything we do and use.<br /><br />  The only problems I have with this program are that it does not have The original long opening credits(part of which are shown on Professor Von Drakes TV Tube) and that this episode can only be rented and not purchased.  I would Gladly Pay more to buy (preferably on Blu Ray) this and other classic episodes.<br /><br />  Anyone old enough to remember and love the old programs, rent and watch them (With your kids or grand kids if you need an excuse.) and let the people running Disney know that there is great demand for these &#34;old shows&#34; .",2015-08-28,1.0,True,1

If so, how did Dr Sebbert get her hands on the money?<br />And there is no other money.....the husband was scrambling trying to find a job, remember? Because for SOME reason, despite being married to someone with a wealthy family(per her flashbacks when she was talking to Dr Banks) She was destitute and angry and lost health insurance.

A man with a dream of music, yet stuck in the day to day reality of existing. Matthew was an up and coming singer with a promising music career, but in 1996 he went to prison for stealing. While in prison he learned to sing in Spanish. When he left prison, he changed his name to Mateo, and went with a new adventure in singing.<br /><br />Mateo has an obsession, and love affair with Cuba. He travels there often, and now is taking another trip to record and put together a new album. His ultimate dream is to live in both places, America and Cuba.<br /><br />Mateo is a different soul. A man who understands the soul of music, and the reality of the beating heart of sound. He has a fantastic voice. He is a very gifted musician. Creating, and writing flawless music.<br /><br />This documentary is very different, very odd, very frank in many realities. It showcases Mateo’s living setting, which is a total mess, definitely a hoarder. It showcases Mateo seeking out the companionship of prostitutes. Mateo's desire to find love and companionship is also a depressing side of this individual. His work life and daily struggles are showcased. His estranged relationship with his mother and father is also displayed.<br /><br />I think the movie expresses a sad soul with a beautiful voice. It's almost a little too depressing in showcasing Mateo's ordeal, but it also displays the ultimate desire, and fortitude to never give up.<br /><br />Something that is expressed is his reality. Some of his fault, is his own doing. His sexual appetite to spend money on prostitutes. That reality can also be looked at, as his loneliness, his desire to have companionship, or find someone to love as he sees fit. He washes away his pain, his demons. He try's so hard I think at times, he loses his way, or becomes more lost.<br /><br />This is directed by Aaron I. Naar. This being his first feature length documentary.

Great photography, editing, acting, and so on. The pace is breathtaking, and the fine points of writing are brilliant. But the film is meaningless and exploitative. Jake starts out as a sociopathic lunkhead and nothing changes during the course of the film. The most interesting aspect of the RB experience is that Scorcese manages to create enough empathy in the viewer that we stay with this highly negative character to the end. But when you look at how this is done, it's no compliment to either the director or the viewers. Some of the attraction of Jake comes as a result of the panache of De Niro. By having this great actor play a sociopath, we get caught up in De Niro's brilliance. The real Jake would lack that. But the chief mechanism of empathy is simply that Jake is a fighter and a winner. He's brutal and he's tough, and he's regularly the underdog, fighting against the odds, so despite all his negative traits, we are on his side. We enjoy being in the ring with him when he's beating the crap out of someone, and we forgive the fact that he's a beast to his wife and brother.  It turns out that this is Scorcese's MO. Again and again, he chooses protagonists who exemplify some ugly aspect of humanity, and then he builds a compelling story by allowing the viewer to identify with the ugliness. So, for example, with Gangs of New York, we get to be racial bigots. With The Wolf of Wall Street, we get to be filthy rich Wall Street tycoons. In a number of his films, we get to be brutal or ruthless gangsters. In each case, Scorcese stacks the deck so that plenty of negatives are revealed, but not so many that we lose empathy and identification with the protagonist. In The Wolf, if he had shown us the victims of the protagonist's hustle, Scorcese would have lost us. He avoids that, shows us a fair amount of arrogance, which ends up being mostly good fun, and allows us have a blast and enjoy the fantasy of making a fortune,getting high and having wild sex, while keeping the tragedies of all those who were defrauded safely off-camera. In Raging Bull, we can shake our head at Jake, but Scorcese keeps us with him, so we can enjoy his brutality, his courage and his triumphs.  This approach to film is exploitative and morally bankrupt. Like most of Scorcese's films RB is a thrill-ride, but an unsavory and conscienceless one.",2015-08-21,0.3333333333333333,False,0
