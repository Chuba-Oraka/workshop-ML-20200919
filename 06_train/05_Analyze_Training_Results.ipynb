    "* **Step** - object that represents next level of abstraction. In Debugger - step is a representation of a single batch of a training job. Each trial has multiple steps. Each tensor is associated with multiple steps - having a particular value at each of the steps.\n",
    "* **Tensor** - object that represent actual tensor saved during training job. Note, a tensor can be a 1-D scaler, as well (ie. loss is stored as a scalar).\n",
