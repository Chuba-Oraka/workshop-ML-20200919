    "# Contextual Bandits with Amazon SageMaker RL\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how you can manage your own contextual multi-armed bandit workflow on SageMaker using the built-in [Vowpal Wabbit (VW)](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit) container to train and deploy contextual bandit models. We show how to train these models that interact with a live environment (using a simulated client application) and continuously update the model with efficient exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Contextual Bandits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever we look to personalize content for a user (content layout, ads, search, product recommendations, etc.), contextual bandits come in handy. Traditional personalization methods collect a training dataset, build a model and deploy it for generating recommendations. However, the training algorithm does not inform us on how to collect this dataset, especially in a production system where generating poor recommendations lead to loss of revenue. Contextual bandit algorithms help us collect this data in a strategic manner by trading off between exploiting known information and exploring recommendations which may yield higher benefits. The collected data is used to update the personalization model in an online manner. Therefore, contextual bandits help us train a personalization model while minimizing the impact of poor recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this notebook contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the exploration-exploitation strategy, we need an iterative training and deployment system that: (1) recommends an action using the contextual bandit model based on user context, (2) captures the implicit feedback over time and (3) continuously trains the model with incremental interaction data. In this notebook, we show how to setup the infrastructure needed for such an iterative learning system. While the example demonstrates a bandits application, these continual learning systems are useful more generally in dynamic scenarios where models need to be continually updated to capture the recent trends in the data (e.g. tracking fraud behaviors based on detection mechanisms or tracking user interests over time). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical supervised learning setup, the model is trained with a SageMaker training job and it is hosted behind a SageMaker hosting endpoint. The client application calls the endpoint for inference and receives a response. In bandits, the client application also sends the reward (a score assigned to each recommendation generated by the model) back for subsequent model training. These rewards will be part of the dataset for the subsequent model training. "

    "The contextual bandit training workflow is controlled by an experiment manager provided with this example. The client application (say a recommender system application) pings the SageMaker hosting endpoint that is serving the bandits model. The application sends the state (user features) as input and receives an action (recommendation) as a response. The client application sends the recommended action to the user and stores the received reward in S3. The SageMaker hosted endpoint also stores inference data (state and action) in S3. The experiment manager joins the inference data with rewards as they become available. The joined data is used to update the model with a SageMaker training job. The updated model is evaluated offline and deployed to SageMaker hosting endpoint if the model evaluation score improves upon prior models. \n",

    "\n",
    "To facilitate experimentation, we provide a `local_mode` that runs the contextual bandit example using the SageMaker Notebook instance itself instead of SageMaker training and hosting instances. The workflow remains the same in `local_mode`, but runs much faster for small datasets. Hence, it is a useful tool for experimentation and debugging. However, it will not scale to production use cases with high throughput and large datasets. \n",

    "In `local_mode`, the training, evaluation and hosting is done with the SageMaker VW docker container. The join is not handled by SageMaker, and is done inside the client application. The rest of the textual explanation assumes that the notebook is run in SageMaker mode."

The work around is to enter the line 1 data as one K1 and line 2 as another k1,etc. Works out ok lists on schedule E and C correctly when you do this.

I have had very little need for such software, especially given the price of accounting software packages. I am not a computer whiz and sometimes find complicated Microsoft software packages difficult to use.<br /><br />I reviewed Quickbooks Premier 2012 previously and my review is virtually identical to that one. I received this software free of charge via the Amazon Vine programme. In truth I would not have bought such software, given my relationship with my accountant. I therefore used this opportunity to try the software without any risk or guilt. As this is the second tine of using I am getting used to how the programme works and the ultimate ease of use.<br /><br />It was simplicity itself to install. The software gives you a comprehensive and easy to use accounting package. Whilst my area of business pertains to the service sector and does require the holding of stock, the software can easily handle business situations where stock control is necessary. It can easily track sales, expenses and profits and can create professional looking invoices using PDF's for emails. It can automatically calculate VAT and creates an Efile so you can send it directly to HMRC. It works with all Office programmes so there is great compatibility, so allowing greater ease of use. It also allows you to create budgets and cash flow projections. In short this software can handle virtually anything a small to medium sized business can throw at it. It also includes payroll software free for 12 months, which allows you to calculate wages, NI, Tax for your employees.<br /><br />A final note on this particular package, there is a difference between Quickbooks Pro 2013 and Premier 2013 software. The Premier software contains additional Time Saving Tools such as, the ability to create budgets and cash flow forecasts, it allows you to create back orders and so automatically set stock aside for order fulfillment, track unbilled expenses and allow you to set different prices on the same item depending upon client or job. All of these time saving options work in the same intuitive way as the rest of the package.<br /><br />Whilst I am a stick in the mud and like the reassurance that my accountant brings, this software is the next best thing. It is easy to use and does virtually everything you will require. A great product at a great price, compared to other accounting software packages.\"]\n",

Instead of opening in 2013, the program would open in Word 2007. So I called Amazon. Amazon suggested that I called Microsoft. I spend 2 hours on the phone with Microsoft, first with a representative, next with a Supervisor and third with a technician.<br />They told me to enter a key, I did so three times to no avail. The technician didn't know if he was coming or going. He tried different things that did not work. There came a moment when he found no better excuse than to put the blame on my computer saying that my computer might have a virus. I know for sure that my computers are all virus free and told him so. Finally the alleged technician asked me if I would allow him to control the computer remotely. He inspected my computer for about 20 minutes, found nothing wrong, and nothing he could do to help me. In the end he told me he was going to send me a large file because he thought that MIGHT solve the problem. The file took some 45 minutes to download and after that I could open the program and finish my job.<br />That was the LAST time I could use the program. The next time I tried to use it, I wrote one or two paragraphs but when I tried to save and close the document, the document &#34;could not be saved&#34;. Instead, the two paragraphs that I had written were magically transferred to Word 2007 and I was, once again, asked for a product Key.<br />I tried to copy and paste from word 2007 to another program that I often use. But, alas, word 2007 did not allow me to &#34;copy&#34; anything either.<br /><br />I decided to call Amazon. Amazon did not help at all and the person I talked to tried to manipulate me and make me feel stupid saying that I am the ONLY person that has ever had problems with this program.<br /><br />All in all, the program could never be used again. I asked for a refund, but both Microsoft and Amazon (shame on them!) refused to give me one. Microsoft put the blame on Amazon and Amazon said the product was not theirs, so they could not grant a refund.<br />I have been buying from Amazon on a monthly basis for over 14 years. I have been refunded hundreds of times for products that were not &#34;theirs&#34;. What does &#34;theirs&#34; mean in this case? Nothing but a very convenient term to rip people off.<br /><br />Conclusion: I will never us another Microsoft program and I will never download anything else from Amazon.com<br /><br />NOTE: I suggest downloading a very good FREE program, very similar to Microsoft Word but without the bugs: AbiWord 2.8\"]\n",

Below is a list of every irritation I have encountered thus far.<br />- Alt+Tab from QD2014 to any other application and QD2014 looses focus on the field you are on and moves focus to the toolbar.<br />- Virtually NONE of the keyboard shortcuts work any longer. i.e.;Ctrl+C, Ctrl+P, etc. They are listed but they do not work. Delete ( Ctrl+D ) works but that is all I have found.<br />- None of the transactions edits work ( Edit >> Transaction >> Copy, Paste, etc. ) when using a mouse gesture. When tried they simply change focus to the transaction behind the pop-up menu. If I click Edit, then finish navigating with the arrows on the keyboard, the Transaction Edits will work.<br />- When entering memorized fields ( Payee, Category, etc. ) the keyboard usage is changed.  Atl+Down Arrow used to bring up menu. The only thing the Alt key does any more is remove focus so you have to use the mouse to put it back on your field.<br />- The Category fields do not remember the last category any longer with a consistent logic. For example having multiple sub-classes under Auto for fuel, repair, etc only returns the update to the high level Auto. Most times the category history is simply alphabetized with focus set to the first alphabetic choice. For example, when entering a transaction for a restraunt we frequent the category choice always defaults to Gift: Birthday and not Dining because I once bought a gift card for a Birthday gift. QD2011 defaulted to last usage.<br />- Many pop-up screens have a Red-X in the top right corner to close the pop-up screen, but the Red-X is never enabled.<br />- Most areas of the register require the user to click two times to set focus. The first click generates of flash of some sort, the second click sets the focus. I think the first click flash opens the pop-up menu for the field, then the second click sets focus.<br />- If you change an amount for a register entry that has split transaction entries the interface goes haywire. I have an entry for my car note as a scheduled payment, Quicken prompts me with the principle plus calculated interest amount. I generally accept the calculated amount. If I pay extra in a month and I go into QD2014 and change the entered amount, and hit 'Enter' QD2014 says the split items do not match, click ok to edit the split. QD2014 now brings up the split amount for the next transaction in the register.<br /><br />I went to a few Quicken support sites and I read that Quicken was claiming that some of actions are new features. WTCuss?!  Who decided that? I can see if they wanted Quicken to operate differently and adding that option in the application ( Edit >> Preferences >> Setup ) but the Setup Switch does virtually nothing.<br />After years of small annoyances this release has pushed me over the edge & I've started looking for a replacement.<br />Goodbye Intuit. Goodbye Quicken.\"]\n",

I've been using Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com (free, online tools) to do this - and they work great, but I bought Quicken as I'm a little uncomfortable having all my financial information on someone's website.  Anyway, both Mint and PersonalCapital report all my account balances accurately while Quicken 2014 does not.  The online help system and forum are useless.  I believe I've wasted my money on this product.  Quicken was a favorite of mine in previous years for balancing my checkbook, but Intuit appears to have broken Quicken, with the online functionality.  (Actually Mint.com has been recently purchased by Intuit - I hope they don't break that.)\"]\n",

Data was converted to the new format..<br /><br />Unfortunately data entry is... Slow.. Horribly slow.. The application is not responsive at all.. Downloaded all of the patches.. Still do not notice a difference in performance..<br /><br />I'm currently running the windows version of Quicken on an I7-2600K desktop with 16 GB of Ram...<br /><br />So I really don't expect applications to run slow on my desktop.. Unfortunately Quicken 2013 performs like each transaction is a pain to record. Like it is searching for something.<br /><br />Application Prompts stay on the screen for extended periods, sometime requiring responses to be recorded multiple times.<br />The Reconcile Screen, works best when you use a mouse to mark transaction as reconciled. If I use the keyboard and space bar, the application response slows considerably.. Counter intuitive as most applications perform better when using short cuts rather then the mouse.<br /><br />Tried the iPad application which is supposed to support data sharing between desktop and ipad.. Wasn't happy that my budgets setup on my desktop were not currently supported..<br /><br />May switch to Mint, (same company) as this web-app may be the best alternative at this time.. Hope Quicken gets its act together soon as the application options are slim in this area..<br /><br />Updated: Restarted my process by recreating a file from scratch. Application runs a lot quicker. Apparently the issue is that it doesn't perform well with a lot of data. The common thread is that a lot of the frustrated users are long time users with history. I don't use the product as much as I did prior although I still use it for balancing my checkbook.\"]\n",

With this product, I did not experience that.<br /><br />I purchased this software for a couple business returns I needed to file and was surprised at how easy it was to navigate through the various sections that needed to be filled out. The results were good and the return printed appropriately. The eFile worked well, too, and the return was accepted by the IRS within 8 hours.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing the product again for my 2014 business returns. I wish they would include the personal 1040 return preparation feature with this, especially for the money you're paying. Unfortunately, you have to buy that separately, AND pay additional money to be able to prepare a state tax return with your federal.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give the software a 4-star. There are improvements that could be made; there are features that should be added; but as it is, it does what it's designed to do and it doesn't take very long to get the hang of it, get your information entered, and get the returns submitted.\"]\n",

I was able to make what I wanted to make, a calendar with additional birthdates and pictures, it just took longer to find something that worked that did not have an additional charge attached to it. I am quite impressed with the updates of this new version in way of built-in page borders so your text or pictures did not shift off the page during printing; also that the text and pictures I add in a calendar, do not overlap the lines for that month!

Importing from Intuit's  Quicken product be very careful for schedule E,C when you print from quicken and you must verify the entries that import to Turbotax which loads different numbers. I eventually selected to enter myself from the quicken print copy. Still playing with the entries of business expenses as the interview and step by step placed incorrect entries in the form result was the same. It aggregated some of my expenses as other when there were actual lines the net effect was the same  but I was looking for accuracy.  I have been using this product for over a decade. Additional notes on TT -It has problems with K-1's - If you have values in lines 1,2,3 it says they are mutually exclusive. The work around is to enter the line 1 data as one K1 and line 2 as another k1,etc. Works out ok lists on schedule E and C correctly when you do this. TT needs to have a check box screen for the variations like do you have data in line 1,2,3  and than handle each one correctly. 1099-t does not ask about additional data to reconcile - it is one the form version . so if you have  no value in box 1 and have reconciliation data on the 1099-t enter on the form as the easy step does not ask.\"]\n",

With this product, I did not experience that.<br /><br />I purchased this software for a couple business returns I needed to file and was surprised at how easy it was to navigate through the various sections that needed to be filled out. The results were good and the return printed appropriately. The eFile worked well, too, and the return was accepted by the IRS within 8 hours.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing the product again for my 2014 business returns. I wish they would include the personal 1040 return preparation feature with this, especially for the money you're paying. Unfortunately, you have to buy that separately, AND pay additional money to be able to prepare a state tax return with your federal.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give the software a 4-star. There are improvements that could be made; there are features that should be added; but as it is, it does what it's designed to do and it doesn't take very long to get the hang of it, get your information entered, and get the returns submitted.\"]\n",

      "context [\"I now run several businesses in the UK. I use an accountant I have known for many years and have always been happy with their service. I have had very little need for such software, especially given the price of accounting software packages. I am not a computer whiz and sometimes find complicated Microsoft software packages difficult to use.<br /><br />I reviewed Quickbooks Premier 2012 previously and my review is virtually identical to that one. I received this software free of charge via the Amazon Vine programme. In truth I would not have bought such software, given my relationship with my accountant. I therefore used this opportunity to try the software without any risk or guilt. As this is the second tine of using I am getting used to how the programme works and the ultimate ease of use.<br /><br />It was simplicity itself to install. The software gives you a comprehensive and easy to use accounting package. Whilst my area of business pertains to the service sector and does require the holding of stock, the software can easily handle business situations where stock control is necessary. It can easily track sales, expenses and profits and can create professional looking invoices using PDF's for emails. It can automatically calculate VAT and creates an Efile so you can send it directly to HMRC. It works with all Office programmes so there is great compatibility, so allowing greater ease of use. It also allows you to create budgets and cash flow projections. In short this software can handle virtually anything a small to medium sized business can throw at it. It also includes payroll software free for 12 months, which allows you to calculate wages, NI, Tax for your employees.<br /><br />A final note on this particular package, there is a difference between Quickbooks Pro 2013 and Premier 2013 software. The Premier software contains additional Time Saving Tools such as, the ability to create budgets and cash flow forecasts, it allows you to create back orders and so automatically set stock aside for order fulfillment, track unbilled expenses and allow you to set different prices on the same item depending upon client or job. All of these time saving options work in the same intuitive way as the rest of the package.<br /><br />Whilst I am a stick in the mud and like the reassurance that my accountant brings, this software is the next best thing. It is easy to use and does virtually everything you will require. A great product at a great price, compared to other accounting software packages.\"]\n",

I've been using Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com (free, online tools) to do this - and they work great, but I bought Quicken as I'm a little uncomfortable having all my financial information on someone's website.  Anyway, both Mint and PersonalCapital report all my account balances accurately while Quicken 2014 does not.  The online help system and forum are useless.  I believe I've wasted my money on this product.  Quicken was a favorite of mine in previous years for balancing my checkbook, but Intuit appears to have broken Quicken, with the online functionality.  (Actually Mint.com has been recently purchased by Intuit - I hope they don't break that.)\"]\n",

Importing from Intuit's  Quicken product be very careful for schedule E,C when you print from quicken and you must verify the entries that import to Turbotax which loads different numbers. I eventually selected to enter myself from the quicken print copy. Still playing with the entries of business expenses as the interview and step by step placed incorrect entries in the form result was the same. It aggregated some of my expenses as other when there were actual lines the net effect was the same  but I was looking for accuracy.  I have been using this product for over a decade. Additional notes on TT -It has problems with K-1's - If you have values in lines 1,2,3 it says they are mutually exclusive. The work around is to enter the line 1 data as one K1 and line 2 as another k1,etc. Works out ok lists on schedule E and C correctly when you do this. TT needs to have a check box screen for the variations like do you have data in line 1,2,3  and than handle each one correctly. 1099-t does not ask about additional data to reconcile - it is one the form version . so if you have  no value in box 1 and have reconciliation data on the 1099-t enter on the form as the easy step does not ask.\"]\n",

Quicken Deluxe 2014 (QD2014) is the MOST frustrating interface I have EVER used. Whenever I get done using QD2014 it is Wild Turkey time to calm my nerves.<br />INSTALL:<br />I have to admit the upgrade from QD2011 to QD2014 was actually painless but that is about the only pain-free step I have encountered.  After importing && converting my backup QDF from 2011 to 2014 I noticed my system was incredibly slow. Quicken has grabbed half the CPU & RAM. Opening & closing the software did nothing to resolve that issue, a reboot was necessary to resolve that problem. After rebooting and opening QD2014 I do have to admit that opening QD2014 did seem noticeably faster than QD2011 but that is where any noticeable gains end.<br />APPLICATION:<br />Entering the GUI I noticed no differences between QD2011 & QD2014. Then I began to use the GUI and that is where the frustration began. Below is a list of every irritation I have encountered thus far.<br />- Alt+Tab from QD2014 to any other application and QD2014 looses focus on the field you are on and moves focus to the toolbar.<br />- Virtually NONE of the keyboard shortcuts work any longer. i.e.;Ctrl+C, Ctrl+P, etc. They are listed but they do not work. Delete ( Ctrl+D ) works but that is all I have found.<br />- None of the transactions edits work ( Edit >> Transaction >> Copy, Paste, etc. ) when using a mouse gesture. When tried they simply change focus to the transaction behind the pop-up menu. If I click Edit, then finish navigating with the arrows on the keyboard, the Transaction Edits will work.<br />- When entering memorized fields ( Payee, Category, etc. ) the keyboard usage is changed.  Atl+Down Arrow used to bring up menu. The only thing the Alt key does any more is remove focus so you have to use the mouse to put it back on your field.<br />- The Category fields do not remember the last category any longer with a consistent logic. For example having multiple sub-classes under Auto for fuel, repair, etc only returns the update to the high level Auto. Most times the category history is simply alphabetized with focus set to the first alphabetic choice. For example, when entering a transaction for a restraunt we frequent the category choice always defaults to Gift: Birthday and not Dining because I once bought a gift card for a Birthday gift. QD2011 defaulted to last usage.<br />- Many pop-up screens have a Red-X in the top right corner to close the pop-up screen, but the Red-X is never enabled.<br />- Most areas of the register require the user to click two times to set focus. The first click generates of flash of some sort, the second click sets the focus. I think the first click flash opens the pop-up menu for the field, then the second click sets focus.<br />- If you change an amount for a register entry that has split transaction entries the interface goes haywire. I have an entry for my car note as a scheduled payment, Quicken prompts me with the principle plus calculated interest amount. I generally accept the calculated amount. If I pay extra in a month and I go into QD2014 and change the entered amount, and hit 'Enter' QD2014 says the split items do not match, click ok to edit the split. QD2014 now brings up the split amount for the next transaction in the register.<br /><br />I went to a few Quicken support sites and I read that Quicken was claiming that some of actions are new features. WTCuss?!  Who decided that? I can see if they wanted Quicken to operate differently and adding that option in the application ( Edit >> Preferences >> Setup ) but the Setup Switch does virtually nothing.<br />After years of small annoyances this release has pushed me over the edge & I've started looking for a replacement.<br />Goodbye Intuit. Goodbye Quicken.\"]\n",

I was able to make what I wanted to make, a calendar with additional birthdates and pictures, it just took longer to find something that worked that did not have an additional charge attached to it. I am quite impressed with the updates of this new version in way of built-in page borders so your text or pictures did not shift off the page during printing; also that the text and pictures I add in a calendar, do not overlap the lines for that month!

I use an accountant I have known for many years and have always been happy with their service. I have had very little need for such software, especially given the price of accounting software packages. I am not a computer whiz and sometimes find complicated Microsoft software packages difficult to use.<br /><br />I reviewed Quickbooks Premier 2012 previously and my review is virtually identical to that one. I received this software free of charge via the Amazon Vine programme. In truth I would not have bought such software, given my relationship with my accountant. I therefore used this opportunity to try the software without any risk or guilt. As this is the second tine of using I am getting used to how the programme works and the ultimate ease of use.<br /><br />It was simplicity itself to install. The software gives you a comprehensive and easy to use accounting package. Whilst my area of business pertains to the service sector and does require the holding of stock, the software can easily handle business situations where stock control is necessary. It can easily track sales, expenses and profits and can create professional looking invoices using PDF's for emails. It can automatically calculate VAT and creates an Efile so you can send it directly to HMRC. It works with all Office programmes so there is great compatibility, so allowing greater ease of use. It also allows you to create budgets and cash flow projections. In short this software can handle virtually anything a small to medium sized business can throw at it. It also includes payroll software free for 12 months, which allows you to calculate wages, NI, Tax for your employees.<br /><br />A final note on this particular package, there is a difference between Quickbooks Pro 2013 and Premier 2013 software. The Premier software contains additional Time Saving Tools such as, the ability to create budgets and cash flow forecasts, it allows you to create back orders and so automatically set stock aside for order fulfillment, track unbilled expenses and allow you to set different prices on the same item depending upon client or job. All of these time saving options work in the same intuitive way as the rest of the package.<br /><br />Whilst I am a stick in the mud and like the reassurance that my accountant brings, this software is the next best thing. It is easy to use and does virtually everything you will require. A great product at a great price, compared to other accounting software packages.\"],\n",

I will NOT buy another version.  Quicken Deluxe 2014 (QD2014) is the MOST frustrating interface I have EVER used. Whenever I get done using QD2014 it is Wild Turkey time to calm my nerves.<br />INSTALL:<br />I have to admit the upgrade from QD2011 to QD2014 was actually painless but that is about the only pain-free step I have encountered.  After importing && converting my backup QDF from 2011 to 2014 I noticed my system was incredibly slow. Quicken has grabbed half the CPU & RAM. Opening & closing the software did nothing to resolve that issue, a reboot was necessary to resolve that problem. After rebooting and opening QD2014 I do have to admit that opening QD2014 did seem noticeably faster than QD2011 but that is where any noticeable gains end.<br />APPLICATION:<br />Entering the GUI I noticed no differences between QD2011 & QD2014. Then I began to use the GUI and that is where the frustration began. Below is a list of every irritation I have encountered thus far.<br />- Alt+Tab from QD2014 to any other application and QD2014 looses focus on the field you are on and moves focus to the toolbar.<br />- Virtually NONE of the keyboard shortcuts work any longer. i.e.;Ctrl+C, Ctrl+P, etc. They are listed but they do not work. Delete ( Ctrl+D ) works but that is all I have found.<br />- None of the transactions edits work ( Edit >> Transaction >> Copy, Paste, etc. ) when using a mouse gesture. When tried they simply change focus to the transaction behind the pop-up menu. If I click Edit, then finish navigating with the arrows on the keyboard, the Transaction Edits will work.<br />- When entering memorized fields ( Payee, Category, etc. ) the keyboard usage is changed.  Atl+Down Arrow used to bring up menu. The only thing the Alt key does any more is remove focus so you have to use the mouse to put it back on your field.<br />- The Category fields do not remember the last category any longer with a consistent logic. For example having multiple sub-classes under Auto for fuel, repair, etc only returns the update to the high level Auto. Most times the category history is simply alphabetized with focus set to the first alphabetic choice. For example, when entering a transaction for a restraunt we frequent the category choice always defaults to Gift: Birthday and not Dining because I once bought a gift card for a Birthday gift. QD2011 defaulted to last usage.<br />- Many pop-up screens have a Red-X in the top right corner to close the pop-up screen, but the Red-X is never enabled.<br />- Most areas of the register require the user to click two times to set focus. The first click generates of flash of some sort, the second click sets the focus. I think the first click flash opens the pop-up menu for the field, then the second click sets focus.<br />- If you change an amount for a register entry that has split transaction entries the interface goes haywire. I have an entry for my car note as a scheduled payment, Quicken prompts me with the principle plus calculated interest amount. I generally accept the calculated amount. If I pay extra in a month and I go into QD2014 and change the entered amount, and hit 'Enter' QD2014 says the split items do not match, click ok to edit the split. QD2014 now brings up the split amount for the next transaction in the register.<br /><br />I went to a few Quicken support sites and I read that Quicken was claiming that some of actions are new features. WTCuss?!  Who decided that? I can see if they wanted Quicken to operate differently and adding that option in the application ( Edit >> Preferences >> Setup ) but the Setup Switch does virtually nothing.<br />After years of small annoyances this release has pushed me over the edge & I've started looking for a replacement.<br />Goodbye Intuit. Goodbye Quicken.\"],\n",

I was able to make what I wanted to make, a calendar with additional birthdates and pictures, it just took longer to find something that worked that did not have an additional charge attached to it.
