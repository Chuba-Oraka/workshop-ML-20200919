Which means I can\'t even use the off-line part of the product.    As a first time user of Quicken, if this is the level of support I can expect from Intuit, I will never even consider purchasing another product from them.    As it stands, I\'m doing my best to get my money back.    UPDATE: Tried another round with Quicken support, who this time actually looked at the logs that I sent them. Problem is that is that the error in the log is one that they said they\'ve never seen before. (For those interested: \\\\"The value specified contains invalid control characters\\\\".) They said it might be due to the file being downloaded from Amazon. So I\'ll wait until it becomes available on the Inuit website and try again. Intuit takes so long to process refund requests for purchases via Amazon that there\'s not much downside to waiting.    So if you\'re thinking of buying via Amazon, you may want to wait until the official release on the Intuit website. Or maybe Intuit is just making excuses.    UPDATE II: After a fourth and final round with Quicken support, I downloaded directly from Intuit. Nope, still didn\'t work. So I decided to ignore everything Quicken support told me and solve it on my own. Even though I was told by Quicken support that the language of my computer would not make a difference, I changed the Windows Display Language to English, and surprise - it now works.    So if you are having registration problems, 1) make sure your display language is English, and 2) question everything Quicken support tells you.    If they hadn\'t told me that my system language didn\'t matter, I could have solved this problem days ago.']","0.11312347330583672"

I have 2 MacBookAirs - one 13\\\\" and one 11\\\\".  The software freezes on both.  I have been able to use this software without freezing for as long as an hour... a short as only 20 min.  Having blown through Level 1 support as well as Level 2, I am TOLD that this case has been escalated ultimately to Product Development... ... where it has been a known problem since the PREVIOUS Quickbooks edition.<br /><br />While releasing this Quickbooks 2013 brings in instant revenue for Intuit, in my opinion that decision to release reflects more on the leadership motives at Intuit than it does on the individual support reps in India\'s Level 1.  Level 2 has most recently embarrassed themselves by asserting unique problems with MacBook Air 11\\\\" only to learn that I also own a MacBook Air 13\\\\" which also freezes while attempting to run Quickbooks 2013.  This same Level 2 Rep then stunningly revealed that Intuit has known about the freezing problem because it existed in PREVIOUS Quickbooks editions. (And somehow was not resolved BEFORE releasing their latest Quickbooks 2013 ?!?!)  I have most recently offered  Tech Support the opportunity to log in and use one of my Air\'s for THEIR further testing.  Personally I am out of time and patience helping them test and troubleshoot software that should have been debugged before being released to the public for prime-time sale.  As of yet I wait day-to-day to hear ANYTHING further about this untenable situation. I invite any serious inquiry from interested Intuit/Quickbooks-for-Mac  management.

This software was very similar.  It walks you through all the sections, such as income, deductions and special situations.  It is less touchy feely than TT.  It is very straight forward and to the point.  The user interface is more simplistic and a touch less conversational but in the end it functioned just fine.  The one thing to be careful of is QTP/529 plan income.  Ideally a program would ask you your 529 withdrawals and college expenses to determine if you withdrew more than you spent, hence have to pay tax.  Instead the program asks you for the taxable amount on your 1099Q.  The key word here being taxable, which you need to calculate on your own.  So while a portion of my withdrawal is income, it is not taxable since my qualified expenses were higher than the amount withdrawn.  If I entered the income amount, my total tax went up, which it shouldn't.  So I left it blank.  Looking at the IRS forms directly, there is no worksheet.
