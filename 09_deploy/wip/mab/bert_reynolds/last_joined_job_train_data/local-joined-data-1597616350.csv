I use an accountant I have known for many years and have always been happy with their service. I have had very little need for such software, especially given the price of accounting software packages. I am not a computer whiz and sometimes find complicated Microsoft software packages difficult to use.<br /><br />I reviewed Quickbooks Premier 2012 previously and my review is virtually identical to that one. I received this software free of charge via the Amazon Vine programme. In truth I would not have bought such software, given my relationship with my accountant. I therefore used this opportunity to try the software without any risk or guilt. As this is the second tine of using I am getting used to how the programme works and the ultimate ease of use.<br /><br />It was simplicity itself to install. The software gives you a comprehensive and easy to use accounting package. Whilst my area of business pertains to the service sector and does require the holding of stock, the software can easily handle business situations where stock control is necessary. It can easily track sales, expenses and profits and can create professional looking invoices using PDF's for emails. It can automatically calculate VAT and creates an Efile so you can send it directly to HMRC. It works with all Office programmes so there is great compatibility, so allowing greater ease of use. It also allows you to create budgets and cash flow projections. In short this software can handle virtually anything a small to medium sized business can throw at it. It also includes payroll software free for 12 months, which allows you to calculate wages, NI, Tax for your employees.<br /><br />A final note on this particular package, there is a difference between Quickbooks Pro 2013 and Premier 2013 software. The Premier software contains additional Time Saving Tools such as, the ability to create budgets and cash flow forecasts, it allows you to create back orders and so automatically set stock aside for order fulfillment, track unbilled expenses and allow you to set different prices on the same item depending upon client or job. All of these time saving options work in the same intuitive way as the rest of the package.<br /><br />Whilst I am a stick in the mud and like the reassurance that my accountant brings, this software is the next best thing. It is easy to use and does virtually everything you will require. A great product at a great price, compared to other accounting software packages."]","0.4217501054882882"

I will NOT buy another version.  Quicken Deluxe 2014 (QD2014) is the MOST frustrating interface I have EVER used. Whenever I get done using QD2014 it is Wild Turkey time to calm my nerves.<br />INSTALL:<br />I have to admit the upgrade from QD2011 to QD2014 was actually painless but that is about the only pain-free step I have encountered.  After importing && converting my backup QDF from 2011 to 2014 I noticed my system was incredibly slow. Quicken has grabbed half the CPU & RAM. Opening & closing the software did nothing to resolve that issue, a reboot was necessary to resolve that problem. After rebooting and opening QD2014 I do have to admit that opening QD2014 did seem noticeably faster than QD2011 but that is where any noticeable gains end.<br />APPLICATION:<br />Entering the GUI I noticed no differences between QD2011 & QD2014. Then I began to use the GUI and that is where the frustration began. Below is a list of every irritation I have encountered thus far.<br />- Alt+Tab from QD2014 to any other application and QD2014 looses focus on the field you are on and moves focus to the toolbar.<br />- Virtually NONE of the keyboard shortcuts work any longer. i.e.;Ctrl+C, Ctrl+P, etc. They are listed but they do not work. Delete ( Ctrl+D ) works but that is all I have found.<br />- None of the transactions edits work ( Edit >> Transaction >> Copy, Paste, etc. ) when using a mouse gesture. When tried they simply change focus to the transaction behind the pop-up menu. If I click Edit, then finish navigating with the arrows on the keyboard, the Transaction Edits will work.<br />- When entering memorized fields ( Payee, Category, etc. ) the keyboard usage is changed.  Atl+Down Arrow used to bring up menu. The only thing the Alt key does any more is remove focus so you have to use the mouse to put it back on your field.<br />- The Category fields do not remember the last category any longer with a consistent logic. For example having multiple sub-classes under Auto for fuel, repair, etc only returns the update to the high level Auto. Most times the category history is simply alphabetized with focus set to the first alphabetic choice. For example, when entering a transaction for a restraunt we frequent the category choice always defaults to Gift: Birthday and not Dining because I once bought a gift card for a Birthday gift. QD2011 defaulted to last usage.<br />- Many pop-up screens have a Red-X in the top right corner to close the pop-up screen, but the Red-X is never enabled.<br />- Most areas of the register require the user to click two times to set focus. The first click generates of flash of some sort, the second click sets the focus. I think the first click flash opens the pop-up menu for the field, then the second click sets focus.<br />- If you change an amount for a register entry that has split transaction entries the interface goes haywire. I have an entry for my car note as a scheduled payment, Quicken prompts me with the principle plus calculated interest amount. I generally accept the calculated amount. If I pay extra in a month and I go into QD2014 and change the entered amount, and hit 'Enter' QD2014 says the split items do not match, click ok to edit the split. QD2014 now brings up the split amount for the next transaction in the register.<br /><br />I went to a few Quicken support sites and I read that Quicken was claiming that some of actions are new features. WTCuss?!  Who decided that? I can see if they wanted Quicken to operate differently and adding that option in the application ( Edit >> Preferences >> Setup ) but the Setup Switch does virtually nothing.<br />After years of small annoyances this release has pushed me over the edge & I've started looking for a replacement.<br />Goodbye Intuit. Goodbye Quicken."]","0.5908689716217284"

Where before there were thousands of projects and clip art that were included with the software download. I was able to make what I wanted to make, a calendar with additional birthdates and pictures, it just took longer to find something that worked that did not have an additional charge attached to it. I am quite impressed with the updates of this new version in way of built-in page borders so your text or pictures did not shift off the page during printing; also that the text and pictures I add in a calendar, do not overlap the lines for that month! Much more user friendly.']","0.32303445684616394"
