      "4\tI've had Webroot for a few years. It expired and I decided to purchase a renewal on Amazon. I went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new.  I called Webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request. He was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever.  He initially told me it wasn't compatible with Windows 10, but I finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with Windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also I showed him a review on Amazon to convince him that it works on Windows 10. Finally, he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars. I declined and told him I'd fix the issue myself. This guy was less helpful than a severed limb.  After spending some time on Google, the issue is now fixed. Webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay Google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer.  As far as the software itself. I think it scans fast, does not slow down my computer and I hope (like most other people including experts) that it's very effective in removing and preventing malware.  Years ago I did extensive research and found it to be among the best, but that was over 4 years ago. Things are fluid in the malware kingdom.  To those experiencing the same issue installing as I did - My advice - don't bother uninstalling the old version, rather launch webroot and click on  &#34;my account&#34; on the right side, then copy and past your product key in the area that says &#34;enter a new keycode&#34;, then click on Activate. This will save numerous painful hours of trying to get the thing to work.\n",

One reservation is that this system (and some others) have evolved to where you just put in numbers and proceed blindly along until the end, and you are supposed to trust that everything is being done correctly, even though it is all out of sight.  Numbers flow into some forms that you never see at the time of entry until you are told you are done and you print out the final data (or save as a pdf).  Since I only do this once a year, I prefer a bit more information/reassurance along the way that all is being done correctly and appropriately.

I was told to wait for their software engineer to create a fix or wait for 2016. This is not a solution when you were using Quicken 2014 and have all of your financial data on it, which is now not accessible because Quicken was too slow in ensuring comparability.\n",

      "4\tI've been using Quicken for over 15 years, and I am always apprehensive when it comes time to update to a newer version. If you have never used Quicken before, I would rate this a 5 star; if you are an experienced user doing an upgrade, I would rate this a 3 as there really is not any new functionality or, if there is, I can't see it for the tasks I perform with Quicken.<br /><br />I made a backup of my existing file, and proceeded to install. Installation went without a hitch, and I didn't even need the backup as this installation recognized my file and took over from there with the conversion process: the conversion took some time to complete, so if you are doing an upgrade go find something to do around the house vs. sitting there staring at your computer.<br /><br />For the new user, this is one heck of a bookkeeping package. I highly recommend setting up the interface with your banks, investment accounts, etc. and have it automatically download to your software. Assign the categories, and after you get a good three months or so worth of data you can start seeing the results.<br /><br />New users - absolutely buy this now. Existing users, wait until the last possible minute before you have the required upgrade.\n",

      "1\tI have been a daily PC user for many years now.  I remember back in the Windows 95 through Millenium days when programs JUST - DIDN'T - WORK well all of the time.  In those days, as many of you recall, programs were prone to glitch, freeze, crash, and become corrupted.  It's wasn't the norm, but it was regular enough that you really had to be adept at troubleshooting and reinstalling programs.  These days, though, we rarely have a computer program crash let alone become corrupted.  After all, this is 2015 and those kinds of problems are a decade or more behind us, right?<br /><br />WRONG... if you're a QuickBooks user.\n",

E-mailed for support on another subject and got a decent response after a few days on that subject. Remade templates multiple times, only to find that only one page had been saved out of three, etc. I finally went back and purchased another copy of MS Publisher to try and get the newsletter done. In less than an hour I had my template and saved it. It opens and has no issues. I pull it up to cut and paste submissions into it without problem. It works almost intuitively at this point. PagePlus just seemed to make EVERYTHING an issue somehow. They have lots of on-line videos to explain things....but what is the use if the work you save vanishes and can' be pulled up or opened after you close it? Is it me?

DO NOT buy this plan from amazon as there is some serious technical issue in the communication channel between Amazon and Adobe.<br /><br />I tried to subscribe it twice with an existing adobe ID on which I was running the trial plan and it did not work. I then created a new adobe ID through amazon and I was able to subscribe successfully. However, after a month and half, amazon abruptly cancelled the plan without my consent. Keep in mind that this plan offers Lightroom mobile - a killer feature that lets you sync low res version of photos to a sharable cloud. Canceling your plan at the wrong time may risk loosing all those photos.<br /><br />I subscribed to this plan during the prime day sale with a $40 amazon credit that was still due. I was able to get that credit (and another $10 inconvenience credit) after haggling with customer care execs, however, I do not want to renew the subscription through amazon. I went and subscribed to it through adobe. That is what I recommend everyone to do until amazon sorts this issue out.<br /><br />As far as the product is concerned, its pretty stellar. You get the latest version of Lightroom and Photoshop. I use Lightroom for all my post processing needs and it works great with RAW files.\n",

After installation a Norton 360 Premier icon shows up on the desktop (doesn’t do anything).  When I try to scan a directory it fails, and tries to autofix.  This also fails with an error 8504, 101.  This leads to a web site that runs through options for using Norton power eraser, Norton removal, Norton recovery.  None work.  Also my finger print reader (USB) built into my HP envy system no longer works.  Yes this is a result of uninstalling Norton 360 because I also have a newer HP envy exhibiting the exact same things are my main system. As soon as Norton 360 was uninstalled, the USB finger printer reader on that system failed to work also. Both systems have windows 10 on it.  Since 360 expires in a couple days I’ve been trying to installed the new Norton without any success.  I’ve used Norton forever barring a few years when it really caused performs issues and haven’t had this kind of problem with the product ever (some problems but nothing that requires this much time). I’ll try to update later if I have any success or move to another security suite. Update:  Third system fails to work with norton security.   1st System - uninstalled norton 360 and tried to install norton security 2nd System - uninstalled norton 360 and ran norton power eraser and norton removal first then installede norton security 3rd System - install norton security without uninstalling norton 360 first.  In all cases I have a product that doesn't work and all exhibit the signs above where it gives the failure code and requests me to uninstall, run utilities and then try to reinstall (which doesn't work).

      "4\tThis is a review of the Microsoft key card version of Microsoft Office for Mac 2011: Home and Student edition. The truly terrible issue I had with this program was getting it downloaded from Microsoft's website. I have wasted at least 12 hours of my life trying to get this version installed. I have downloaded the program over 30 times on 3 different computers and with 3 different browsers. I have received checksum errors every time I clicked on the downloaded file. This is a known issue: https://www.google.com/#q=checksum+error+when+downloading+Microsoft+Office+for+Mac+2011. I was unaware of this when I purchased this version from Amazon. Also when I initially searched for Office for Mac on Amazon the option to get the program on disc was not displaying. This would have been my preferred option for a number of reasons, my present problems included. At least with no Internet connection I could have still installed the program.<br /><br />Finally last night I was able to resolve my issue. One of the tech support persons in the Philippines told me that Microsoft had issues with downloads via my ISP Mediacom. I actually thought of a solution that worked which I suggested to him. I had to leave the call after telling this person about my solution but was able to implement it later that evening. I had my son who lives in another city with a different ISP download the file into his or my Public Dropbox I forget which. I then dragged the disk image file onto my desktop and was able to install the program. It is worth noting that when he download the file it was the correct size hence no checksum error. The program installed without issue. I was also able to update the program through the update feature and the update downloaded using my ISP without issue. So I really don't know where the fault lies with respect to this issue. It is not as simple as it seems.<br /><br />One warning. The program included an icon for Outlook. I was curious because it was not listed as coming with the Home and Student edition. When I clicked on it and it asked for a product key. This appears to be an attempt to get you to purchase Outlook. Based on other posts I stayed away from the offer to connect to Office 365 and Microsoft Document Connection. I seemed to remember other reviewers having issues with these features.<br /><br />I am admittedly an Apple fan but I was very favorable impressed with the quick look I took of Excel and Word. They are much more feature rich than Numbers and Pages the Apple equivalents. They also have a much `busier' interface and the icons in the menu bars did not have elegance that one associates with Apple design sensibilities.ith the Home and Student edition.

I, like an idiot, fell for it. In the back of my mind, the logic began to swirl and reach it's way to my mouth, &#34;How is it possible for me to have 'spyware' and corruption of my 'registry' when I just finished building my PC last night??&#34; He then stuttered and stated that, &#34;AVAST offers a great 24/7 technical service that would have a technician ready to fix any issues you may encounter for a year called, &#34;Avast Total Support&#34;. The service costs like $179 and a one time fix would cost $119. I think you can see where this is going and what kind of company Avast truly is. The technician goes on and says, &#34;I'm here to help and I'm going to delete the viruses&#34;. I state, &#34;I have no viruses my computer was just built and turned on last night. It's an issue with my registry, malware&#34;. He states, &#34;It's all the same thing, viruses, malware, spyware and the issues stemming from your registry are because of the viruses&#34;. After about 4hrs of him manipulating my computer from his, he tells me, &#34;You're all set.&#34;. I was not at all, &#34;set&#34;! After about two days of back and forth's I lose it and demand a refund for fraudulent promises and lies. I receive my refund and invest my money in Kaspersky. I haven't had any issues as of yet. My experiences with Avast were terrible because they use these fear instilling tactics in order to con us out of our hard earned money; for a useless product. They lied about my computer having viruses and a corrupted registry, they lied saying the technician will fix everything, they sell faulty software (Grime fighter does NOT work as intended).\n",

I'm trying to create an account here.  It's ignoring the &#34;create account&#34; button and acting like I'm just trying to log into an existing account.  I purchased the download version and it looks like Amazon doesn't provide a way to get a refund.  Very frustrating.  Should have purchased this at Costco.  No problems with returns there. Update: Called Norton support (800-844-3362).  Got connected to what was an obvious off-shore boiler room. The tech informed me that I could get charged for the troubleshooting diagnosis depending on the problem.  After several attempts to get the tech to comprehend the problem, I ended the call. The download version is on a deal-of-the-day sale ($27.99) today.  Don't waste your time. Update 2: Several hours later, I was able to register as a new customer and then downloaded the software without issue. There is an annoying pop-up you will inherit if you accept the recommended load configuration. I leveraged the Control Panel to find and get rid of it.  As mentioned, support was a nightmare (see below) so I didn't call them again.  However, I feel compelled to upgrade the product  to 3 stars.  It is working, Norton did respond to this posting, and and the price was right.  The issue I was having with the website registration process may have been due to an overwhelming response to the sale.  I suspect the Norton support staff was equally overwhelmed. Update3: To be fair, it now looks like I was not talking to Norton Support.  After they fixed their website, I was able to create an account and get the correct Norton Support phone number.   Perhaps if I ordered the key card version a support phone number would have been on it.  I went back and checked all emails & links received from Both Amazon & Norton.  Nowhere can I find a support phone number.  This is kind of a catch 22 if you order the downloaded version as I did.  It puts you in search mode which opens traps like the won I walked into.

After several e-Mails back and forth I, in frustration, Deleted Cook'n.& contacted the IT person who helped me to reinstall the Program without any charge and I am pleased to say that I can print again & was able to rescue all of my Recipes\n",

      "1\tLooks like I'm one of the few who don't like this.  Admittedly it's more because of the company's business practices.  Norton has come preinstalled on my last two devices but I elected to use the programs I've found elsewhere.  Each time, though I haven't activated the preinstalled subscription, as the time approached, and for a l-o-n-g time afterward I'd get emails from Norton reminding me to renew, even when I went to their web site and requested they stop.  Just don't want to do business with a company like that.  Oh, prior to that, when I did use Norton it was never up to the performance of the other software.\n",

      "1\tI bought this on Amazon about a year ago. A bit over a week ago I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. A couple of days ago MS Word stopped working, with a &#34;repair&#34; notice on attempted use. It has been impossible to log into MS Word since. Other features of Office appear unaffected. This problem was noted by others previously, but none of the reported fixes (and I have looked at a half dozen online, including trying to fix a presumed compatibility issue) worked. So I had the word processor for a year. It is hard for me to accept paying nearly $100 per year for the word processing function. I have currently gone to a freely accessible processor, and there is no immediate sign that Microsoft can actually repair my access problem. Since MS Word was the main reason I bought the program, this is quite a disappointment. In addition, numerous attempts to uninstall and reinstall have all ended with the same unsuccessful result.\n",

      "4\tI use this as a drawing program on the desktop side of the Surface Pro 3. Great tools. I particularly like being able to rotate the &#34;paper&#34; on the screen. Some of the tools take advantage of the pressure sensitivity of the n-trig pen I use and some don't. I wish I could program pressure sensitivity options for all of the tools. Maybe you can and I just haven't figured it out yet.<br /><br />I use this mostly to draw manga for fun, both characters and full pages. Everything I need is right there from pencil sketching to inking and colorizing. The Surface Pro 3 is just the right size to work on for me as well. Sketchbook Pro's tools don't take up too much real estate on the screen. Not quite as specialized as Manga Studio, which I also use, but then again I'm not a professional illustrator.\n",

      "1\tThis program is a steaming pile of horse manure.  Honestly, if you buy this you will be throwing away your money and significant amounts of time while causing yourself  a huge amount of frustration.<br /><br />Your bank and credit card transactions, if you can manage to finally and occasionally get them to sync, will not import correctly and you will be frustrated trying to correct the mess the import leaves behind.<br /><br />You 401k will be either way overstated or understated - despite the fact that quicken knows what your share totals are supposed to be, it will instead try to calculate what it believes they should be based on who knows what logic.  And while there appears to be a process to correct your number of shares, it will not update your account after you make those corrections.  They just sit there in a &#34;placeholder&#34; entry, enticing you to spend even more time trying to figure out how to get the place holder to actually adjust your balances.<br /><br />You work with it over and over, thinking if you just figure out something it will all fall in place and make sense, but no.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work.  And then you go on line and search and find that everyone else has the same problems and they are not fixing them - there are no solutions.<br /><br />Finally - the Quicken is being spun off from intuit because intuit has no solutions for the problems and doesn't want to be associated with this steaming pile of bovine excrement because it is becoming an embarrassment to the brand.<br /><br />If you buy this stinking piece of crap after this warning, i pity you.  Sure, I saw some bad reviews but figured, this has to be user error.  I am tech savvy and I will get this to work.  Look at the cool graphs and reports and all the details!  Get all your accounts in one place!  It really is cool!<br /><br />But it just doesn't work.  I had quick books for a small business I did accounting for 15 years ago, and that actually worked, albeit, with a few frustrations and bugs.  But 15 years later and things are much more promising from the outside but much worse in actuality.\n",

      "3\tBe warned. This video editing software has some really irritating behavior. Apparently, Cyberlink doesn't feel it has to conform to the Windows programming standards. So when you have each pane set to the size and placement you like and then exit, you've just lost those settings. You've also lost the size and location of the overall application windows. When you next open PD13, the window will be maximized and the Timeline, Media Content and Preview panes will be at their &#34;default&#34; sizes. Really, really irritating to have to manually size everything to your liking each and every time you open the application.<br /><br />This gets 3 stars because of the video editing functionality of the software, otherwise I would have given it 1 star for the massive failure to conform to the simplest of Windows programming standards.\n",

I have subscribed to the pro version for the last 2 years.<br />Advanced System is now ASC 8 not 7.<br />Advanced System Care Pro (or the free version) is a stand alone program. But there are also downloadable (free) add ons that are useful to excellent. These add ons are downloadable through ASC.<br />Some observations I will share.<br />(1) Considering the entire program and all the bits and pieces its a great program with some serious reservations.<br />Its a great program for the everyday computer user to clean up the computer in one step/operation.<br />It does do a great job cleaning up system files. Never had an issue causing system problems from using it.<br />But my reservations:<br />(1) It seems that iObit is always trying to add programs. Programs like their Malware fighter, which I find next to worthless as compared to Malwarebytes. You have to be careful as these programs will slip on to the computer. Now these programs are NOT bad per say and can be very helpful. Driver Booster is an example of an outstanding add on  program  to update all your drivers. I highly recommend this program.<br />(2)  But the issue I have is that some of these programs  want to run in the background. There is no real need for this. It will just slow down the computer, especially if you are doing intensive demands on it. The faster the processer/ more Ram  the less of a problem this is.<br />You will need to turn these programs off under settings on each of them, You have to uncheck &#34;load at system start up&#34; so they do not boot up initially. You will also have to turn them off after use. Especially if you do not reboot your computer daily.<br /><br />I would have no problem with awarding 5 stars if these 2 issues were addressed by iObit.<br />(1) Do not run on start up is the default settings. The user can turn on if they choose.<br />  Actually Norton 360 and Malwarebytes are the only programs that I run in the background.<br />(2) Stop the add on programs without full disclosure, such as a pop up, asking the customer if they want to add this program to their computer.<br />  Saying downloading is not enough.  They can always be deleted thru  add/ remove programs or programs and features (windows 10).<br /> These programs running in the background, especially all the add on programs can slow your computer down.<br /><br />That said I do like ASC 8 a lot. But It does take some persistence to stay on top of these two issues. A novice might have problems with these items.  If you land up with all these add ons running in the background it could slow things down.\n",

      "5\tI have been using this iBank 5 for only about a month now, but I'm giving it 5 stars for one reason more than any other ...CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I had been using Quicken since 1991.  Any long time Quicken users know that using that program is like being in an abusive relationship.  You are forced to upgrade every few years.  There hasn't been any real functional improvement in  a decade or so.  Instead, each upgrade would bring problems, as the program would bloat and bloat.  The records you have carefully maintained would suddenly develop years worth of errors.  A few years ago, I switched to Mac, and since Intuit has some sort of vendetta against Mac, and never developed an equivalent Mac version, I had to buy Parallels ($), buy Window's 7 ($) and then put Quicken on the virtual machine just to run the d**n program.  This means every time Mac upgrades their OS, you have to worry about Parallels not working or Windows not working ..... what a PIA. Finally when Quicken, through a known glitch, prevented me from connecting a few accounts online, and I was going to have to delete the accounts, and start over, I'd had enough.  Of course there was never an easy way to get any support through this. But I had so many years invested in that program I was extremely reluctant to leave.  Nevertheless,  It was time to take the money out from under the mattress and escape to the safe house of iBank.<br /><br />Since I've only been using it for a month, and I have so much data and so many accounts to review I won't say this is a final verdict.  But in general the import from Quicken went extremely extremely well.  Even though I have many different accounts:  bank, savings, loan, investments, 401K, option, brokerage accounts etc.  they all seem to have come over well.<br /><br />I've had some issues with their &#34;Direct Access&#34; duplication entries.  I also don't like that Direct Access doesn't allow bill payments to originate in iBank.  But &#34;Direct Download&#34;  seems towork just fine.  I'd recommend using only that for getting your accounts online.<br /><br />But the BEST part, is that as I've had problems, I was able to quickly get someone in a chat window who in each case, actually knew what they were talking about, and quickly helped me work out solutions.  HOW GREAT IS THAT!  I know it will take a long time to get everything just so, but knowing I really have help is wonderful, and rare enough these days.<br /><br />I agree that reporting is not nearly as good as Quicken, and I like my reports.  But I think the reports are reasonably good.  If that's the worst of it, I'll be happy.\n",

Quickbooks has to be the least user friendly piece of software I've ever seen. And it takes forever to load! Before purchasing it, I'd read another review that said you open the program then go make a pot of coffee. Hopefully, by the time you've returned, it's finally started up. Totally true. I wish I'd listened to that review!<br />Quickbooks is not intuitive. The layout, wording, buttons, NOTHING makes sense unless maybe you're an accountant or an old person who still uses floppy discs and a computer with green words on a black screen.<br />Bottom line, if you're under 30 years of age and like your smartphone, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I like that the software comes with plenty of its own titles, transitions, particles, etc. and that users can find more of these features online for free. I also like that it's easy to create or customize and share these features with other users via the free member's website. While it may not be the easiest to use software right out of the box, it has the most professional and customizable features of the video editing software I've tried for a very reasonable price.<br /><br />One thing to note. Cyberlink could do a better job of evaluating the computer requirements needed to run the software. If you only have the basic requirements listed, the software probably is not going to run well and it might not run at all if you are processing HD video. You will need something very fast with a very high end video card if you want to process 4K video. There are many complaints about the software freezing. This happened to me often when first bought PowerDirector (I think it was version 9 or 10). I had better than the system requirements listed an a brand new computer. I went and bought a faster computer with an upgraded video card and never had the issue again.\n",

I continue to get Exit code 7, ERROR DF015. I begin to think this is a TRASH program? Suggestions are welcome. Does anyone know how to reach Adobe for support?

Unable to comprehend the maze of Adobe support online highly advanced computer advice to fix. My computer: 2014 27&#34; Apple iMac 5K with lots of RAM and hard drive space available. Unable to access human help from Adobe. Am I a victim of the competition between Apple and Adobe? This program is useless as is.  Extremely disappointed! For the first time as an Apple computer owner (since 1988) I am unable to even install this program on my Apple 27&#34; iMac 5K which dramatically exceeds all Elements 13 requirements. Trying to reach Adobe support for days. The install process is quite unlike most software designed for Apple OS X, certainly it is neither intuitive, automatic, nor simple! Have previously used and enjoy Photoshop Elements 10 regularly but this has become a rare nightmare. Among other things it insists on FIRST turning OFF any internet protection software as if this would somehow suddenly become a safe environment for operations.\n",

Annual subscription renewals and upgrade costs after that.  The iOS versions should be included with a Direct Access subscription.  The iOS apps should be Universal instead of requiring separate purchases for iPhone and iPad versions.  New iBank 5 purchasers should receive Direct Access for a greatly reduced price, and annual upgrades should also include Direct Access at a lower price.  Ideally, there'd be an iBank 'Pro' version that included Direct Access.<br /><br />Pricing suggestion:<br /><br />* iBank Standard (Mac-only, no iOS, no Direct Access)<br />* iBank Pro (Mac-only, Direct Access)<br />* iBank Mobile (iOS only, no Mac, no Direct Access)<br />* iBank Mobile Pro (Mac & iOS, Direct Access)\n",

Maybe you can and I just haven't figured it out yet.<br /><br />I use this mostly to draw manga for fun, both characters and full pages. Everything I need is right there from pencil sketching to inking and colorizing. The Surface Pro 3 is just the right size to work on for me as well. Sketchbook Pro's tools don't take up too much real estate on the screen. Not quite as specialized as Manga Studio, which I also use, but then again I'm not a professional illustrator.\n",

      "5\tI've been buying taxcut for many years and this has been a consistently good product. I prefer to buy digital download version.  No issues or surprises with install or use or filing.<br /><br />Here's a nice handy feature that comes with the program. (I think you have to save your tax return as a PDF once for this to activate). I like the built in PDF995 feature that allows me to &#34;print&#34; PDF files from ANY software I have on my computer.  What happens is that after installing taxcut, a new printer called PDF995 appears on your list of printers in EVERY program. So when you want to make a PDF in any program, don't pick &#34;Save&#34; but instead choose &#34;Print&#34; and select PDF995 and it will ask you where you want to save your PDF document.  Taxcut does not have to be running, just installed.for this feature to work. I use the PDF995 every day to save web pages and other things on my computer as PDF files.\n",

The licenses I bought were never applied to my account but I received confirmation emails of the purchase as well as had my credit card charged. That started the customer service debacle. After SIX hours being continually (27 times) transferred among both McAfee and Digital River to get the product fully activated, neither side claimed responsibility even though I had supporting evidence. Whenever I requested a support supervisor (4 times), they directly hung up on me with a phrase to the effect of &#34;you're wrong our system doesn't show that&#34; or &#34;it's the other company who controls that process you'll have to call them&#34;. I requested a refund of this order- but instead (debacle #2) McAfee totally wiped out my account- I lost 5 licenses in addition to the new purchase I intended to cancel. I have since spent another FOUR hours trying to recover my original licenses but it is fruitless. McAfee customer support is a complete pass-the-blame game joke.

I do not understand how they manage to stay afloat with such terrible software.  Pay heed to the feedback, and ask yourself:  &#34;Would you buy a tangible product if it had the terrible reviews Quicken Mac does&#34;?  I look at those very carefully and find out what did the 1 stars have to say, and what % got 4-5 stars.  I have not been disappointed with that stratagy.\n",

      "4\tThere is so much that I can say about needing the right protection for your computer, Most anti-virus programs are more for the brand name like McAfee and Norton, which honestly can be more of a waste of time, and do not fully protect you against the harshest of viruses, spyware and malware. I have tried different ones that say they are the best, and instead left traces of spyware to where you cannot use the computer anymore. When I had heard about this antivirus program from Webroot, I was a bit skeptical to see whether or not, it actually holds up strongly to the programs that I have used in antivirus protection like Bitdefender, which honestly has been the best third-party protection software I have used in the past several years. Webroot, comes in at a close second, which works very nicely, and gets to the heart of the matter on all of your computers. My gripe about it though, is that I wish they could've done a much more faster job at getting rid of the Trojans, the way Bitdefender has worked so well. Still, it is a good protector from Spyware, and one that I suggest you buy, if you cannot seek Bitdefender.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Convience: B<br /><br />Overall: B-\n",
      "2\tI purchased Elements 13 download because my new laptop (as with many newer laptops it appears) does not come with an optical reader.  The E-13 suite duplicates, in part, what is already in Elements  8 (which I have used quite happily on my older laptop for a good while). The Guided and Expert options of any real use in E-13 seem largely spins on what is already offered in the Quick Option (which, again, is pretty much the same as Elements 8). The upgrades in E-13 appear largely to rest on the social media connectability and multi-image options such as albums, calendars, and the like); options for which I really have little use or interest. E-13 does, however, seem to boot up more quickly than E-8.  Also, there were 4 fatal errors in the download, leaving several functions unavailable (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, for example).  Thus far, then, I seem not to have gotten everything for which I paid. There are fixes indicated for the items which failed to download, but initial efforts to discover how to install them according to information provided in the error Report have gone unrewarded.  All-in-all, I would have to say I am a bit disappointed in E-13 and am glad I waited to purchase it until the 1\\2-off Daily Deal. E-13 is a welcome addition to this laptop, but with what I have seen of E-13 thus far, I would have been happier had there been a download for Elements 8.  Peter O. Welte\n",

You can't lose them, or accidentally spill coffee on them! All of the facts provided as straight forward, and are quick study tools!

      "5\tAs the main cook in the household (yes, some of us guys DO actually try to keep our wives out of the kitchen lol), I have used this program over many years through the different versions. I have over 200 hardcover/softcover cookbooks as well, and you can probably understand that it's not easy searching for recipes through my physical cookbooks (although thankfully there's a website helping with that now). Cook'n makes searching for recipes quick & easy, whether you are searching by ingredient, cuisine or course. You can search through the recipes you already have in the cookbooks on the program (which you can add to via purchases in the DVO store, or easily make your own), or you can search the web for recipes via the program itself. My favourite part of this method is that once you've found what you are looking for you can capture the recipe into the program, it even captures the photo. I actually have a cookbook I've made in Cook'n simply titled &#34;Web Recipes&#34; into which I capture recipes that I want to try later. If I like the recipe I move it to a chapter in &#34;Web Recipes&#34; and if I don't like it I just delete it. Nice and simple.<br />Cook'n has had some problems over the years and like any software problems and glitches raise their head at times. The wonderful thing I've found though is when they do happen, the people at DVO really stand behind their product. Customer support is quick, courteous and they really show they not only care about their program, but their customers as well. Updates are continually done to improve each incarnation and the ability to save your recipe collection to your personal Cook'n cloud account is a real gem. If any of you have ever lost work/files when your system crashes you'll know what I mean. At this stage you might be thinking I seem biased and I wholeheartedly agree :). When I find a product that works, is great value and is supported by the company that makes it like Cook'n is, I will ALWAYS be biased lol. Great product, great people working for them, great company. Couldn't recommend it fast enough to anyone who loves to cook. And if you live outside the USA take heart - I know it states here that it's only available in the USA but if you live outside you can purchase direct from DVO!\n",

It did the job it was suppose to do immediately, BUT it keeps itself presented to you all the time & parks itself  up front when you open anything you want to run. One little slip of the mouse pointer will wipe out what you were trying to open. I have removed it completely now. It unloads a lot of stuff in Recycle Bin that should never have gotten there.

It kind seems like a waste of a device almost.<br />-I continue to get banners at the bottom right of my screen saying that Chrome isnt protected, regardless of how many times i click &#34;Do not ask me again&#34;<br /><br />All in all, Norton Security is a very, very good choice for your PC and will keep you protected.

There are so many features that make it great to work with, such as changing the theme background for different recipes, using another website's recipe link to enter in my Cook'n book by just doing a bit of cut and paste.  I would like to have the ability to add more than one photo of my recipes in the book though.  Sometimes, it's good to see photos of the progress of how a recipe is made, but for now, only one photo is allowed.  The Customer Service is terrific as well.  When I have questions or issues, I have my reply from customer service within the next 12-24 hours.  I LOVE COOK'N!\n",
      "5\tGreat product.\n",
      "1\tI purchased this tonight to be able to get into my Quicken files.  I followed all instructions, including the asinine user name and login instructions.  I set up my question as it requested and then tried to login.  It would not accept my login information so I tried to answer my safety question, however, I was not asked the right question and therefore did not have the answer.  I uninstalled the program and went through the entire process again.  This time verifying every entry and using a different security question.  I tried again and once more I was denied entry.  Once more I was asked the wrong security question.  I don't know what is going on but it is impossible to contact quicken.\n",
      "5\tI truly appreciate the great support from the customer service folks.  I developed some computer problem when downloading a cookbook and received help within 24 hours. I am not computer savvy but the instructions were clear and easy to follow and the staff worked with me until I got it working. Later, I tried installing Cook'n on a new computer and again received speedy and useful assistance. It is one thing to have a terrific product which Cook'n is, but to support that product with great service is awesome.  Cook'n is easy to use and I love capturing recipes. I gave my daughter and daughter-in-law Cook'n as gifts several years ago and they enjoy it as well.\n",

      "5\tI have been looking for a great electronic cookbook for all of my wife's old manual file recipes and Cook'n has filled the need.  Not only is the Cook'n software easy to use when installing the recipes, but I now can carry the recipes with us when we travel.  They are on my iphone, ipad, and laptop.<br />With all of the recipes on the iphone, it makes it very convenient to shop at the grocery store and purchase everything that is need for the evening meal. Even my son, who lives 600 miles away has a copy of all the recipes on his note book.  The support team at Cook'n has been great to work with.  Their response time to any problem that arose was addressed with in 24 hours of my request. They believe strongly about their software and want to the customer to be just excited about using it.<br />Bottom line is &#34;If you want at great electronic recipe fie at your finger tips, you should really take a good look at the Cook'n program.&#34;\n",
      "1\tMy employer just upgraded to this and it's absolutely awful, I'm going to have to see if I can convince IT to let me go back to Office 2010. I didn't like the ribbon interface when it came out and after all these years I still find it cumbersome but at least it doesn't make my eyes hurt. Office 2013 is full of glaring white space wasting huge amounts of screen space. There is practically no contrast anywhere and it just looks like a sea of text on a drab white background. Has Microsoft lost their mind? I've seen better UI designs on beta software and open source junk from 15 years ago.\n",
      "1\tWas not specific as to what it was clearly providing as a product. I needed an access key to do homework online for my classes and the product clearly says access key however it is more of a tool to help you learn instead of the tool I needed to get online.\n",

      "5\tI've been a loyal follower of Cook’n for many years now. I love it so much that I have given many a copy of the program to friends and family. If I have had a problem, the support team has been great in helping straightening it out very quickly. I really can't say anything bad about the program. Usually because I'm busy showing it off to my friends as I instantly send them a copy of the recipe we were just talking about.<br /><br />Thanks so much for making a great program that everyone can enjoy and share their love of Cook'n.\n",

      "5\tI'm definitely not an early adopter of most technology, despite the fact that I work in web content creation. However, I'm pretty self-aware of my technology needs and managed to make a 2006 iMac serve my photo and video editing needs with Final Cut Express for nearly ten years with little issue.<br /><br />When I recently upgraded to a 2015 MacBook Pro, I needed a serviceable video editing software that I could use for simple cuts and HD exports. Finding myself looking for something with functionality (and price) between iMovie and Final Cut Pro X (or Adobe Premiere), I ordered the trial version of Adobe Premiere Elements 13 and quickly found it to be exactly what I needed for my simple video editing needs, at the price I was hoping.<br /><br />If you're not happy with the iMovie interface (I wasn't) and aren't willing to spend at least $300, Adobe Premiere Elements is a great option. I was impressed with how intuitive the interface was, but maybe that's because of my familiarity with my version of Final Cut, which I've heard is similar. It has just the right amount of options for what I need--picture adjustments, integration with other Adobe software, etc.--to be the perfect choice for my video editing needs.<br /><br />Let's see if this last me for the next ten years! Things are already looking good. :)\n",

      "3\tIt's MS, what can you say? Some of the features included were ones long overdue, others new and very smart, but with MS they have to find places to take two steps back. Schools make you buy this for their convenience when older versions would work just fine. Just another college, money raking kick back scheme to help fleece students because they don't cover this with all of the tuition and innumerable fees.<br /><br />In most regards, I like my older version of office I had already bought and paid for. This version may be better for people with different wants or needs in their use, but so far I have not seen enough improvements to have otherwise updated\n",

I love that I can change any recipe to include amounts for large dinner parties or small parties with a single stroke to change the amount of each ingredient.  I have given the Cook'n software as a gift to my children and even some close friends.  I have provided them with my files so they have all of the family recipes and at the same time start their own cookbook files.  Can not say enough good things about this product.\n",

I could not always boot up; sometimes got a black screen.  In safe mode I got a message that files were missing from C drive.  I do not have a back up disk.  My computer is useless.  It is very difficult to get a refund from this Co.  They are set up this way.  Asked for refund before 30 days were up. They have a ticket system that is impossible to use.  Sent them an email from a neighbors computer stating I couldn't boot up- please call me. No call.  Finally got a refund after reporting them to the BBB and started a case through my credit card Co. Beware, they will continue charging your card after you have canceled.  These same complaints are on their own website.  There is a male on youtube complaining about the same thing.  He was also working with his Credit Card Co. I should have read reviews  before I got involved.\n",

I thought this web access product gives me the code to enter the class web, but it seems my misunderstanding. But I cannot get any details about it, any reviews, or even inquire. I know it's just for review, but not where I make inquiries though, I hope someone in charge sees this review and responds.\n",

      "4\tGreat composition software that works as expected.  This is the best software for screenplay composition and is very user friendly.  I remove 1 star only because there is a bizarre &#34;feature&#34; in the software.  It will automatically open to the monitor upon which it was displayed when the file was saved.  This causes a problem if you are working on a laptop and have FD open on a remote monitor when saving.  If you disconnect the laptop from the monitor and reopen FD, the FD file tries to display on a monitor that is no longer hooked up. This results in the file appearing not to open.  This is especially important to keep in mind when collaborating with others via email, as they will may not be able to see the file after opening it.  The very easy fix is to simply move the FD display to your laptop (or primary) monitor before saving.  I've never encountered composition software that tried to open on nonexistent remote monitors before.  However, the program is very good aside from that.\n",
      "5\tGreat software; great price.\n",
      "1\tIntuit constantly forces it users to upgrade every 3 years by disabling online banking and downloads. This year I had to upgrade from 2012 which was working okay. 2012 was no dream either. Every version makes changes that add little value and rarely fix major user interface issue. Simple things like how things are sorted or how reports are displayed have the same bugs for years and years.<br /><br />The 2015 is the first version that crashes, has memory leaks, and general gets slower the longer you use it. Coming from 2012 I would expect improvements, but it is actually worse. For every previous version I stored my quicken data file on a windows share so that both myself and my wife can enter transactions/reconcile  from different computers. 2015 is so slow that I had to fundamentally change my workflow to sync files from the share locally on program launch and then sync back on program close.<br /><br />I am not even a Quicken power user. Last year I decided to ditch TurboTax for TaxACT. The only thing keeping me with Quicken 2015 are all my existing transactions and my use of Quicken Bill Pay. However, I am seriously considering moving to another program because I have really had enough of Intuit. Intuit should really be embarrassed at their software. They are like the Comcast of Financial Software.\n",
      "1\tThis software is loaded with features, but is very difficult to use and appears riddled with bugs. Pages would look fine on my computer, then items on different pages would disappear or change format when I previewed them in a web browser.

Save yourself from hours of frustration and avoid this software.\n",

I bought also Print artist, same computer requirements and it works. Tried to resolve the issue with Encore tech support, they can't fix it. Many people have the same issues, I found out too late. Amazon can't give a refund since they do not own the right to the software. Encore provides a full warranty for digital downloads with refund if you request a letter of destruction. I requested the refund and was told this won't apply if downloaded from another site. They can't fix it but I am the one out of money?

I sincerely wish I'd done my homework on this before I'd uploaded over 50 (slow slow slow) gigs! I was ready to drop the $60 for videos/documents but instead I'll continue with Dropbox.

I am making cookbook for my grandchildren (8 of them) and would like to be able to do this for them. I know I can do it in Word or a similar program, but it just will not look the same as the rest of the cookbook, the text and everything will have a different look to it.

I've encountered failures with Kaspersky consistently once every week or two on two different computers. I've reinstalled this piece of crap so many times I've lost count. I'm sick of it.  Uninstalling it is another nightmare. It will not uninstall properly from the control panel so you have to download a special uninstaller.

      "4\tI moved from spreadsheets and keeping physical copies of my receipts to Quicken 2015. I had heard good things about it for a couple of years and decided to jump to this. I had also heard of Quickbooks, which is the more advanced, extensive and expensive financial management software from Intuit. I had also heard of MINT from a while ago. I didn't want to do everything online so I knew I wanted a desktop version and I didn't need all the features of Quickbooks since I'm not an accountant. So this serves me best. I'm pleased with everything—the layout, the categories, the transaction retrievals, the budgeting system...etc. I just feel that I have a much better and more comprehensive grasp of my finances. My only issue right now is that when I try to attach images of my receipts, the program crashes and has to be restarted. I would really like this to be fixed. I'm a fresh new user (3 weeks of using) so I have a lot more to learn and take advantage of. I would highly recommend this product!\n",
      "5\tFantastic product, easy to use, cloud is an excellent feature, but the best part of this product is the service you receive if you require any support.  I've had this for over 3 years and each time I need to reach them they get back to me immediately.  I also have bought recipe cards from them too and they even touched base with me to verify if I had yet received my shipment.. this kind of support is unheard of nowadays.  Anyone that likes their kitchen and likes organization --- this is a must have.  I would recommend this easily.\n",
      "1\tI am not entirely technologically illiterate. I use either my iPad, iPhone or laptop, as well as other forms of technology on a daily basis, for work and otherwise. Currently, I am continuing some education for my profession and needed to download Microsoft Word for the particular program that I am enrolled with. I had owned a Mac for years prior to purchasing a PC, so admittedly am not entirely used to this platform. However, how hard can it be? Just follow the directions, right?!<br /><br />WRONG!  I did as instructed and spent the $140 for the download only to discover, to my chagrin, that the program is no where to be seen on my laptop. I searched high and I searched low, then my husband did likewise later last evening, but it was not to be had. We could see that it was purchased but wasn't in the area of my computer that they said it was supposed to be.  I realize that the more computer savvy out there might be smirking at my ignorance, however, this was supposed to be a simple download, and since when does one need a Master's degree in computer science just to function on a basic level in everyday life?!<br /><br />As a result, we have my laptop at our computers tec's office now. More than likely, he will be able to figure it out quickly ( gee I hope so). The point is that it's needlessly complicated. Also, I am missing a day's work on a long assignment due to this issue.<br /><br />In addition, as if that weren't bad enough, supposedly one gets a $40 promotional gift credit for purchasing this abysmal program, for future purchases on Amazon. I had hoped that might provide some sort of recompense for the downloading nightmare. Wrong again! I just sat here for 30 minutes trying to get the code to work, and it didn't!  I wasn't able to contact Amazon about the issue either because their contact form doesn't include that as an &#34;issue&#34;. It's like this entire purchase is totally jinxed or something! I have never posted a 1 star review before. I am a fairlyoptimistic/fair person. This has just been a horrid experience.  I wish computers would go back to having the word processors already installed like in the &#34;good ol' days&#34;.<br />Very disappointed!!!\n",

This is big no-no for any video editor who needs to work with both audio and video.<br />- I have no intention of trying out or even touching the newer PowerDirector 13 or any other future iterations. How has Cyberlink not gotten a lot of the bugs in v12 straightened out, being their 12th version of this video-editing software program?<br />- For all my griping though, I will say that this is a sub-$100 video-editing software program, and that the price I paid was arguably fair given its capabilities (one can only expect so much from it at that price point). The bugs and frequent crashes are still extremely hard for me to overlook however, particularly since I've been doing more heavy-duty video-editing over the past year, and as a result, have just moved on to a more robust (and more expensive) video-editing program.\n",

      "5\tCook'n is very easy to use because of their simple, clean design.  This is what sold me on their software over 5 years ago.  The software contains some of the best features you can find in any recipe program, particularly the ability to capture recipes from almost any source.  This feature has saved me countless hours of re-typing the recipes that I find on the internet.  Also, some recipes that I find on the internet are uniquely formatted and do not import properly into any of the programs, however the use of the snip-it tool, makes &#34;cutting and pasting&#34; almost automatic.  Additionally, the customer service is very responsive, only through e-mail however.  They have responded within 2 days with answers and step by step guidance to resolve any issues (many of which were my own).  The ability to save all my recipes to the cloud gives me the freedom to plan meals on the fly with either my iPad or android device. I find this useful when I am not planning my meals, but am shopping and seeing what is on sale.  Retrieving recipes on the fly assures me that I leave the store with all the ingredients necessary.

      "2\tFirst of all, I would avoid any reviews that are more than a couple of months old. They do not appear to reflect the current state of affairs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Amazon Cloud Drive.<br />1. The product simply isn't usable in its current state. The main issue I have is that there is no way to merge files from multiple locations. Let's say I have a Music directory with a Led Zeppelin directory in side it and in there I have the &#34;I&#34; album as MP3. I upload the whole thing to ACD. So far so good. Tomorrow I buy the &#34;II&#34; album as MP3. I can upload the Led Zeppelin directory but then it is just up there by itself. If I try to move it to my &#34;Music&#34; directory, I get the following prompt:<br />&#34;Move Name Conflict. The destination directory already has a file named: ... What do you want to do with the new file? [Skip]&#34; That's right, your only option is to skip. You cannot merge two directories together without doing it one file or directory at a time. It is absurd. Whoever designed this should be fired immediately.<br /><br />2. Amazon Cloud Drive is a separate service from Amazon Music. Sure you can download the stuff from AM and then upload it to ACD but what's the fun in that? And if you want to be able to hear your all your MP3s in AM, that is a separate subscription and you have to upload them again.<br /><br />The only way to make this work reasonably is to create a single drive that hosts your backup volume and periodically upload the whole thing to ACD. (Otherwise you'll be dealing with merge conflicts and folder micromanagement.) This does not work for me because I do not have particularly fast uploads or a drive big enough to host my entire backup locally.<br /><br />I can accept the lack of synchronization. In fact I don't actually want that feature because my archives are currently spread across multiple drives and there isn't space on any one device to synchronize a single drive. I don't want files disappearing because they don't happen to appear on one particular drive.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I gave these guys 90 days to get this fixed. They didn't. I have canceled my subscription.\n",
      "5\tAlways a good product\n",
      "3\tI GOT THE WRONG THING MY FAULT\n",
      "1\tTLDR: Quicken sucks horribly for budgeting, and pretty much everything else. If you want to budget go use YNAB.<br /><br />Like nearly everybody, when I wanted to get control of my finances, I started out in Mint, and it was fantastic. I was able to get all of my accounts on there, get in the habit of categorizing my transactions, keeping track of my upcoming bills, and really start to get a handle on things.<br />After about 6 months of working in Mint, I wanted to start to get more involved in reports and budgeting and decided to upgrade to Quicken. I had used Quicken a long time ago and for many reviews, it was still seen as the standard for personal finance, plus my parents have used it for years , it's also put together by Intuit. I figured it was the natural progression and good move.<br /><br />What a mistake that was. Quicken 2015 is a cluster. It's just horrible.<br /><br />First of all, you can't migrate your Mint transaction and history straight to Quicken. This baffles me and was one of the assumptions I had made in my decision. Mint is made by Intuit, Quicken is made by Intuit, you'd think that moving from one to another would be easy. It was a horrible week long trial of downloading the files from Mint, trying to shove them through one third party converter or another. I even tried editing them by hand in an effort to get Quicken to recognize them. In the end, I was forced to just recreate all of my accounts in Quicken. All of my categories I had setup in Mint and assigned transactions to were gone. Plus I had to go back and re-categorize the transactions that Quicken had now downloaded from my banks. Even after all of that I still had 2-3 accounts that Quicken did weird things with when interacting with my banks and I had to do those manually anyway. FYI: Just because your bank interacts with Mint, doesn't mean it'll do the same with Quicken.<br /><br />It took me months to get back to the point I had with Mint, where my accounts were all generally stable, and I could get around Quicken. So I decided to try setting up a budget. First, the help section on budgeting in Quicken from the website is pathetic. It's like a single page consisting of 1. Click on this button to create a budget, 2. Name your budget, 3. Save your budget. Which makes it sound all nice and easy, but as before, it was a rabbit hole of frustration with not understanding what the hell was going on, where was it getting these numbers from, and what do these numbers even mean, anyway. I was being forced to budget for interest on my mortgage, rather than just the payment; it kept telling me that I needed to budget for my 401(k) contribution which came out of my paycheck. In the end I had no way of telling where I was at in my Frankenstein monster of a budget anyway.<br /><br />In frustration I downloaded the free trial for YNAB and OMG what a difference. In contrast to the hours and hours I had spent wrestling with Quicken I had my all of my accounts and my budget setup in YNAB within a couple of hours. When I had questions on how to set stuff up or what I should do with a particular situation, YNAB had articles, tutorials, videos, and even a free online live class that quickly answered all my questions, and got me completely setup. It is so easy, and unlike Quicken, is built from scratch to work with your budget. It's so easy to download and import my transactions into YNAB that I'm done in like 2 minutes a day. It's at the point where I'm wondering if I'm really doing everything I need to do with my finances because I'm done so fast. And I'm on a budget. For the first time in my life I'm on a budget and it feels fantastic.<br /><br />So in the end, Mint is great for what it does, but when you want to do more with budgeting, don't move to Quicken, go to YNAB.\n",

      "5\tI initially purchased this software in December 2014.  And while I immediately loved it, there was a learning curve and a few minor issues.  However, all issues were handled quickly with detailed directions and explanations.  It really is easy to pull in recipes from Pinterest and other websites.  Yes, there are a few websites that don't pull in perfectly, but then I'm not sure there will ever be a software program capable of that.  The newsletters are informative and have links to Youtube videos that are very helpful and details on updates and issues.  Then there are the weekly meal planner emails and finally the Cook'n club that I recently joined and provides an opportunity to connect with other Cook'n users.  I've worked with software engineers and I know that you can load software on three identical machines and have it behave differently on each one.  This software is exceptional because of the people behind it and their attitude towards their customers.\n",

      "1\tThis is simply not acceptable. I understand that this was a &#34;gimme&#34; with my Amazon Prime subscription, but for it to be a sustainable solution, I need to be able to upload my pictures first! So I wasn't having any log-in issues like the others. But I recently updated my iPhoto library to Photos, and now this app is worthless. I can't drag & drop from Photos to ACD, nor can it &#34;see&#34; my Photos.library from the finder -&#62; media section. This app is obviously not being maintained, since it isn't away of that little module that gets Photos content into the media browser. So I tried uploading through Safari. Fail. So, I have years of photos & since all iPhones repeat the same file name, uploading to safari generates a bunch of  duplicate errors with every batch i try to upload (one month of one year at a time) Since everything goes in one folder (too tedious to manually create a thousand folders). At least this could recognize these duplicate file names and add a suffix &#34;_1&#34; etc. so essentially this app and the service in general is useless right now. And even when it is functional it isn't that great.\n",
      "4\tI got mine as a free download since Microsoft offered as a free download.  I downloaded it yesterday and I like the ways it looks.  Briefly my laptop stopping working last night which was frustrating but it seems to be working fine today.  I wasn't really bothered by having to go to the right side to get the power button to appear.  But for those that liked the older method it is now a button on the lower left.  When you click that, it opens up and panel that looks like cells phones which I think is neat.  I like it enough that I am now contemplating updating my old XP computer.\n",
      "2\tThe software works great, and I've always liked Elements, but after a recent reinstall it requires me to sign in to Adobe to use it.  I have never had to do this before with software that I paid for and have a valid license for, and I refuse to use software that requires me to sign in to use.  Adobe support confirmed that there is no option in this case.  Because of this I will be uninstalling Elements and using something else.  It's too bad, too, because I like Elements.  But Adobe's current policies have pushed me away.  Buyer beware.\n",

I'm not into doing everything online even though I'm an internet addict, and the options are really limited for easy to use money management software. Honestly, the only things I use this for are keeping track of my bills and as a check register. I changed my password at my bank, and now the auto update feature doesn't work anymore -- and yes, I changed my password in Quicken. I can still download directly from my bank, though. It does better at keeping track of my money than I do, which isn't really saying much. Overall it's meh, but it works. I just wish it worked better.\n",

      "1\tFirst:  DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE.<br /><br />I've had some editions of Quicken before, usually slow and clunky and hard to manipulate.  2015, once I downloaded it and linked it to my accounts, was much faster and more intuitive.  I linked all of my accounts and started to download info, set up categories, etc, and then finally was ready to export my info to excel to do some graphs and analysis.<br /><br />And...it doesn't export into Excel.<br /><br />Are you friggin KIDDING ME?!?  I have a piece of financial software that doesn't export into a spreadsheet, which every previously modern version of Quicken does as a &#34;well, duh...&#34;?  Is Intuit run by absolute morons?  Are they TRYING to destroy their brand?  And why doesn't someone, like ANYONE, else develop a decent financial software package?<br /><br />This was a joke.  I have rarely regretted a purchase as much as I regret this.  If I hadn't downloaded this digitally from amazon, I would have returned it in a heartbeat.  I'm never buying another Intuit POS product again.<br /><br />Now excuse my while I research on the Internet on how to find a kludgy workaround to compensate for a simple feature that USED to be in older versions of this same software.\n",

In my humble opinion, it is one of the very best security softwares out there. I really trust it a lot. It is used where I work to look for malwares. I must admit that when I saw this product on Amazon with a lifetime license, I got a little suspicious, leery. &#34;What is the catch?&#34;, I asked myself. Its developer is not issuing lifetime licenses any longer, it stopped in the first quarter of last year. If you buy it on its website, you only get a one year subscription for 25 bucks. But I took the plunge and spent the 39 bucks on it. The &#34;My Account&#34; tab on the right upper side when clicked shows duration &#34;Lifetime&#34;. I also ran mbam-check(available on Malwarebytes homepage) and it also shows no date for &#34;Expiration Date.&#34; So, I think this is the real Mccoy. Besides, I do not really think Amazon would risk its reputation by badly misrepresenting something. But in order to be 100% sure, I will have to wait until next year to see if any message pops up asking for more money to renew my license. That would be, for me, a huge disappointment, with Amazon...\n",

I would expect this rendering speed in like Quicken 1995, not Quicken 2015. Not only is it buggy, but it is extremely complicated - and I'm a software engineer so I know my way around computers. Not impressed at all with Quicken, I will continue just making my own spreadsheets in excel.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that it could NOT get the balance of one of my accounts correct. It pulled the information from the card website, and it just kept coming up incorrect. Apart from all the odd issues, bad layout, and step learning curve, why would I pay for a product who's core functionality doesn't work?<br /><br />Will be getting a refund directly from Quicken, because Amazon has a blanket no-refund policy on software - in this case they make you go to Quicken. Also not thrilled with that.\n",

I bought this software instead of using FREE version so I can get support if I have any problems. It seems like a good anti-virus software. This company keeps sending me notification to get other products. Finally on 8/19/2015, I bought Avast Clean for $35.99. I ran this software thru my PC. After that, I got &#34;Invalid Value for Registry&#34;.  This means that (2 of many problems, just to give you examples) I could not listen to music such as .MP3 or viewed picture such as .JPG. My PC will not recognize pictures/music on my C drive or USB drive.  I am using window 10 with my new computer (got this LENOVO PC as X-mas present to myself last year from Amazon). My computer is less than a year old. I call 24/7 tech support twice. Bother times, these reps gave me &#34;not my problem attitude&#34;. They told me to pay another $179.99 for them to help fix the problem. My PC was running fine until this clean. It might be co-incident with my PC after running their products. They are NO help at all. I was very upset and regret that I bought their software. I spent all day (skipped work) fixing this problem by following instruction from window forum web site. However, nothing worked! Finally, I called my good friend who is a DBA of a big company in my town. He came over and used Wise Registry Cleaner (FREE software) on my PC. Everything is working great (back to normal). As soon as my one year end, I will buy different anti-virus software. btw, I send this company my review directly to their web site. I doubt it if it will do any good because I am just one customer to them.\n",

I spent the entire weekend last weekend from the moment I got off work to late Sunday evening trying to get an activated product that could be disk imaged for backup. Waited it out throughout the week by downgrading to Windows 7 and tried again this weekend. I's the middle of Saturday, having stayed up late on Friday evening to make another go of it. Finally, I remit--half my hair is gone--I'll pay for the stupid full version of Windows 10 just to avoid the outright stupidity involved with having to load old software on a machine with updated USB 3.0 hardware in order to take advantage the not-so-free-considering-you-should-be-paid-for-the-time-lost-researching-the-upgrade-process &#34;upgrade&#34;.

      "1\tI stopped using Quicken for a while and I bought this version to give it another try. I regret the 2 hours of my weekend I spent trying to make this thing work.<br /><br />First of all, to create a new file you need your Quicken web id. If you use TurboTax, you probably have one, but I do not understand why they need your web id to create a brand new file even before they know if you are going to use the online services. They force you to register the product to create a new file.  I almost turn around at that point and uninstalled the thing, but I decided to continue.<br /><br />Second, the interfase is cluttered and not intuitive. They put drop downs everywhere and it takes a while to find the action you want to perform. I left this product for a few years and I expected to be surprised with the improvements to the look and feel, but no, is the same thing I remember from before with a lot more options crammed.<br /><br />Finally the deal breaker was that I can not get past error OL-254-B.  This is hilarious. I setup one online account, worked a bit, then closed the program. The next time it opened I got this error when trying to update the online accounts. The error message tells you that you either cancelled the operation, or your data file is corrupted, or your program files are corrupted.  It looks like the guys that wrote the online services had no idea how the other parts of the application worked. I followed the troubleshooting steps, repaired, my data file but no luck. I uninstalled the program and the services worked, but the next time I logged in, the problem was back. I tried once more, because I am an optimist, but the problem came back again. I think this is related to a problem with a software update that the program tries to install. In any case, that was it for me I decided to uninstall it for good and try something else.<br /><br />From the little I saw, I think you can get most of the Quicken functionality in Mint ( unfortunately also an Intuit property ).  I was interested in the cash flow forecast, that is why I tried to get this program working. Not worth the additional effort. This is it for me buying from Intuit.\n",

I am assuming, since I am a long time user, I got the chance to download Cook'n 12 before its final release.<br />Support for Cook'n has been great, efficient and answers within a day for me.

The access code worked to allow me to log into the site. However, the eBook is not accessible without an internet connection, which means I am unable to access it while I am away from home. Completely useless! I need to be able to access my book while in class or while studying during breaks. Even when I am at home or have an internet connection, the eBook pages take an eternity to load. The online software is not very good at all. It is terrible.

      "3\tI have been using Quicken 2012 since this was current.  This version has a kill switch that terminates its transaction download function in April 2015.  They don't make it a secret, but rather keep pointing out that an upgrade is necessary.  I have had over 40 years experience in what we now call IT, and have a degree in computer science, but although it may be hard to imagine, upgrading Quicken on my home PC has not been on the top of my priorities list.  So I procrastinated until this month when my need to complete some tax work more or less forced the issue.<br />I downloaded the 2015 Deluxe version from Amazon with the childish expectation that I could invoke a straight forward install script and within an hour or so of casual attention, I would be back in business.  I was naive.  I see from users posting on the internet that many report 2015 as full of &#34;bugs&#34;.  This was not my experience.  When all was said and done, the problems I encountered were not really product bugs, but time consuming knowledge gaps.  I won't go into the specific problems I ran into, because I suspect they are not universal.  The install script makes some strange assumptions like my system was running under XP.  Turns out there is an option accessible through the advanced properties function of the desktop icon that allows the specification of the operating system.  You just have to know its there and all makes sense.  I am sure that if you attend a proper 40 hour users class on features of Quicken 2015 this fact would be covered; perhaps on day 3 in the afternoon.  But, some of us really would like to use Quicken to record and balance our bank accounts without obtaining an advanced degree in Quickenology.  This is not a &#34;bug&#34;, just a knowledge gap for which the user is responsible.  There were several such knowledge issues throughout the upgrade.  So if you go this route, and like me you probably don't have much choice unless you want to put your entire banking on a server in the internet &#34;cloud&#34;.  Man-up and expect to take the time to learn far more about Quicken than you ever thought necessary or desirable.<br />The most positive aspect of the whole process was Quicken customer support.  I was fortunate enough to have my problem ticket picked up by a very pleasant and knowledgeable technical support woman who had attended the 40 hour users class and gotten her degree in Quickenology.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not encounter any true &#34;bugs&#34;.  My not knowing what to do is not a &#34;bug&#34;.  If you decide to upgrade from an older version of Quicken to 2015, be prepared to spend some study time.\n",

I also appreciate the fact that I can edit audio right in Sound Forge through a gateway in Movie Studio which is a time saver by not having to learn another audio editing application.

I wasted money on Power Director 13 through another Vendor. I took a chance on the this New Roxio  My DVD.  I am crainaly wired for this Program since I owned the Old One (2009). It has surpassed my Expectations!  I downloaded it (10 Min on Uverse Max (18 MBPS) then it took another 35 Min to Install). Everything is editable in Simple timelines. The difference of Flying a Kite (My DVD) and an AirBus 321( Power Director 13).  I produced and Excellent 7 Button Menu.  Excellent, Applause, Cheers,Thumbs Up.  Roxio had out done themselves.<br /><br />Spoke to Soon Everything loaded up just fine, Every Feature work perfectly came time to Burn DVD, OOOPs ! ! ! Windows 8, Dell CPU 660, Clean Install, No Previous Programs; it just would not Burn, Errors: Image failed to Burn, it will burn one small movie but will not burn 7 Movies with 2 Menus. Uninstalled Roxio, went back to my Corel Movie Factory 7 Pro., (which I wanted to get away from)  Everything worked fine. Corel Movie Factory 7 Pro is not my Favorite Software but I guess I am forced to live with it<br /><br />Sept 7, 2015:  Tried it on 3 pc 2 with Win 7.  One with Win 8.  Would not burn on any of them. I dedicated 3 PC with Windows 8 for Media Only Movie make and Audio. I reinstall  Windows 8 and Started Clean.  It worked!  I guess Roxio My DVD like to be First on the PC.  I installed a slew of other Programs including Windows Movie Maker 6.0 my favorite for Editing (I am Old School). Everything is Hunky Dory now. As a precaution I Created a Restore Point named &#34;Hunky Dory&#34;. I would have given it a 5 if it were not for all the Installation and Compatibly Issues, I give it a 3, But it works just fine! ! ! !\n",

      "1\tI purchased and Installed it on my one-year new iMac, to work on a Word document that I need to edit.  It immediately prompted for a &#34;update&#34; right after I tried to open the word, which I did.  The first word document I opened has half of garbled stuff. It did something to my system that screwed up my Pages functionalities, as well. My Pages is no longer working, all Pages files are showing garbage prints.<br /><br />I have been an Amazon member since 2003, this has yet to be the first purchase that I cannot &#34;return&#34; or do anything with it.  The damage is serious.\n",
      "2\tI purchased Cyberlink's suite of media programs ... and here's how it worked:<br />By reading at least some of the Critical reviews, you will get a good idea of what you're getting .... BEFORE you spend a hundred dollars and feel mislead and have to add yet another Critical review to the 29 that are already here.<br />And notice that a good number of the critical reviews are written by Vine Program &#34;customers&#34; .... who got this product for free and often feel guilty if they don't find SOME positive things to say in order to give a favorable review.<br />The complaints you see are fairly legitimate (for the most part) and often center around the fact that you have to spend fifty or more dollars every year to keep your program up-to-date.  Imagine if Microsoft did this to their Windows customers: make them pay $69 every year for a more up-to-date product.  And theirs is a complex operating system requiring thousands of programmers to put it together & keep it up-to-date .... and not merely a media suite like Cyberlink has.<br />No one would pay $69 EVERY YEAR for updates .... yet that's EXACTLY what Cyberlink asked ME to do (and I did it ... six months ago)  and now is asking me to do AGAIN,  six months later,  now that my MediaSuite 12 is out-of-date,  and MediaSuite 13 (the updated suite) is available.<br />Let me clearly state that again:  I had MediaSuite 11 but was &#34;convinced&#34; that I needed MS 12, so I coughed up the seventy dollars (upgrade price) and got MS 12; yet now I have to pay ANOTHER $70 to get the 12 new-and/or-improved features of MS 13.<br />Do they provide enhancements to current owners for FREE?  Free updates:  ever heard of that concept?<br />Apparently not, because now I'm in a never-ending cycle of annual updates .... but only if I want to pay for them.<br />The MS12 suite of programs seems to work fine .... but then so does Microsoft Windows XP for the last six years WITHOUT paying a dime for any upgrade.<br />Summary:  the PowerDVD is a fine product and so far has worked well for me.  I like the Photo Director's many features,  and I like Power2Go for making DVD & CD copies.  I also like MediaEspresso for converting photos & videos to other formats.<br />What has NOT worked for me is downloading videos from YouTube to play alone on my computer or tablet:  apparently I now need the $70 upgrade ... to version 13 of MediaSuite, for that to work properly.  Oh ... and it's Windows 10-ready.  Great !<br />Windows 10 is a FREE upgrade ... but I'll need to spend $70 for the newest MediaSuite to run on it.<br />I don't feel I've gotten my moneys-worth yet from MS 12  so I'll just keep using it,  for .... maybe another six months;  at which time I'll likely spend the $70 for version 13.\n",

      "5\tI have had Cook'n for several years. It is a tremendous tool for managing recipes. Now. with the Cloud function it communicates across PC or Mac, tablet and smart phone.

      "1\tIf you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…<br />This program is a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />Now, for the actual review.<br /><br />If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

Mostly, Norton doesn't constantly pop up asking me questions like other Antivirus's.  Its also one of the biggest companies so I don't have to worry about odd compatibility problems, I can nearly always ignore warnings that I should turn off my antivirus to install something.<br /><br />I don't like the backup or the PC maintenance that is included, but the security protection is very good in my opinion.<br /><br />Some people complain that it is resource intensive, but my slowest computer is an Intel i5 480M with 4gb of ram and my best PC is an i5 2500k at 4.3GHZ with 12 GB of ram so I've never even noticed it.

      "2\tYou might be surprised, but I actually believe Norton 360 Premier edition, which I still have at this moment on 3 machines, is a great total security suite ... That is, unless you are also running Systweak.com's excellent maintenance suite, called Advanced System Optimizer (ASO in short), which I have, and which I prefer to Norton!  I loved the Norton suite until about 6 months ago, when Norton started quarantining an executable file called Advanced System Protector (ASP), part of the ASO suite.  At first, I just downloaded the latest version of ASO and re-installed it. But again Norton snatched ASP, so I learned to get it out of quarantine and set Norton to Exclude it from scans. Norton then started snatching some of the other executable files for other purposes [based upon Heuristic scanning - they all are working files - i.e. they don't stay still as Norton demands!] and quarantined those.  So I got them out of the quarantine and excluded them.  This has carried on getting worse and worse [Norton describes them in quarantine as Gen(eration) 2 Trojans], until today despite that I hit Exclude, nothing happened, and the files went to hell, where Norton had decided they should be!  So, at last I am looking for an equally efficient Security Suite (very difficult to find), but am not prepared to use BitDefender, which is supposedy the #1 security suite, as it is, along with Norton, another Symantec suite: and I'm not about to be nice to a company that will not allow me any say in the matter, whatsoever!  To them, ASO is malware, so I advise you not to use Norton 360 if you have ASO or any other suite that might have equally good, or better (as in case of ASO), abilities to catch non virus-malware.  If you don't get Norton, try ASO to maintain and even rescue your computer if necessary (perhaps in Safe Mode if your computer will not start properly).<br /><br />You might notice that Norton when it caught some of its non-virus malware initially (over a year ago) caught itin 'ASP's Quarantine!'  After that, I *deferred to Norton and stopped running ASP, leaving Norton to do so.<br /><br />*I was more considerate than Norton!\n",

      "5\tFantastic program that does &#34;nearly&#34; everything you need to make importing recipes from the web and making them your own. Also provides really good cookbooks that be imported as they are or into your own on-line cookbooks. The graphical component is GREAT! I love being able to easily add pictures to my recipes. I bought the program only 8 months ago and already have added over 4000 recipes into my own cookbooks / categories. That doesn't include the recipes from the Cook'n cookbooks. The only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that I thought scanning recipes from my multiple cookbooks would be easier -- but the scanning is only easy if the formatting is in one column -- two columns or more recipes just don't work -- and being a speedy typist it is easier to just type in the recipes. Once you figure out the short cuts built into the program -- you find even the typing isn't laborious. Best of all the technical support is some of the best I've encountered. I've never asked a question that I didn't get an immediate response for -- sometimes from multiple people. Also the forums and the newsletters really help to keep you informed and up to date. Finally, when I switched over to Windows 10 and my application &#34;wasn't happy&#34; they had a &#34;fix-it&#34; up immediately -- and it worked. I tried other programs in the past (on older PCs) and I tried to create my own database of recipes. This program far outstrips anything I've ever used. I have some computer skills which helps me use some of the advanced features -- but I am by no means a programmer. With a few skills at hand you will find you can build a recipe base that is not only complete, but also impressive.\n",

Probably the best thing about the product is the technical support and follow up which has always been timely (say within 1-2 business days) and frankly it's only getting better with each iteration and the input the company asks for from the customers.

      "5\tI have had Cook'n for some time. I originally obtained a free (CD) copy of it when I purchased my Sun Oven. That was Cook'n 9, I believe. I upgraded to 10, and then 11 via the download option, directly from DVO, and not from Amazon, but Brennah at DVO asked me if I'd be kind enough to write a review. I would have written it years ago, but I didn't know until now that Amazon carried it. It never crossed my mind to check it and write a review.  I am on a restricted diet, so there are a lot of cookbooks that I can't purchase, but I do buy one occasionally and the downloading process is very easy. I have found some very good recipes, such as &#34;Apple Brownies&#34; in their apple cookbook. They are really good, and as I can't have chocolate, they are a good brownie option, they have a lot of cookbooks so it should be easy to find something that appeals, and, if not, you can always import recipes from the web, or input your own. I do purchase the different themes for my recipes, and I like being able to change the look of my recipe &#34;cards&#34;.  I don't use the nutrition or menus options, or grocery lists, so I can't say anything about that.  Prior to Cook'n, I had a folder on my Mac desk top named &#34;Cookbook&#34;  (still do), and placed category folders in it for whatever I wanted-&#34;Chicken;&#34; &#34;German;&#34; &#34;Beans;&#34; etc., and this system has branched out into several other desktop folders, with their own folders, such as &#34;Pie Cookbook;&#34; &#34;Ice Cream;&#34; and has actually gotten a bit out of hand. 8) I can save recipes from the web to any of these folders, and that's nice, but. .. .  It's very nice to be able to put my own recipes, or import recipes from the web in my Cook'n software and group them into chapters with my own chapter titles-such as &#34;Spiralized;&#34; &#34;Homemade Noodles;&#34; &#34;Sourdough;&#34; and so forth. I can use a different theme for each chapter or use whatever theme I own for any recipe. The themes are inexpensive, some are free, and you get a relevant theme when you purchase a cookbook. I can also print out any recipe, with or without it's theme, on 1 sheet, or as recipe cards. You can choose from 3x5 or 4x6, and whether you want to start with the 2nd card-in case you have a long description on the recipe that you don't want on the cards. You have to cut these apart, but there are guides and it's easy to do. If you get your recipe messy, you just print a new one and shred the old. I print out my most frequently used recipes and keep them in a little recipe box for easy access. The Mac is not in the kitchen and I don't always want to copy out the ingredients and amounts, or run back and forth.  My favorite thing is to take a picture of a recipe with my digital camera and import it to the recipe. I can also import videos, but never have. I like having my own pictures illustrate the recipe.  I've never used other cookbook software, so I can't comment upon that, but Cook'n is very thorough, they update it frequently, and I really enjoy using it, and I recommend it. I read their monthly newsletter and it's nice. You can import recipes from that. I also just have the Mac, and have had no experience with Cook'n on a tablet, or Smart Phone.  Is Cook'n perfect? No. I've had various problems with it, some small-such as a missing ingredient in a purchased cookbook recipe. You have the ability to edit even a &#34;published&#34; recipe, which I like. If you see a misspelling, you can fix it, etc., and once you know the proper amount of the missing ingredient, you can correct that in Cook'n. That's nice. Occasionally there are bigger problems, such as not being able to open it every time Apple does a major OS X update, but customer service is always responsive and there to help, and Josh, Bridger, and Brennah have been very helpful and knowledgeable about their software, and they are nice people too. Dan Oaks, the founder, and the whole team are always looking to make Cook'n better and better and do frequent upgrades.  Except for an unfortunate addiction to &#34;Free Cell&#34; in my Solitaire program, 8) I think Cook'n is my favorite software. I can recommend it. Yes, it will sometimes be frustrating until they fix a bug, and especially after Apple updates, but I really enjoy using it and miss it when it's down.  8/20/2015 UPDATE: Just this morning I received an offer via e-mail from Dan Oaks, Cook'n founder. Cook'n 12 will be released on Oct. 25th, and I received a special pre-release offer to download it now, for $19.99 less than the full price, and start using the pre-release version now. Over the next two months, there will be frequent upgrades and by the release date, I will have the full version, and won't have to learn all of the new features at once. I have taken advantage of this and have already downloaded it and it's working just fine.\n",
      "5\tI have been using Cook’n for 5 years now.  I used to have a box of old recipes which I imported to Cook’n.  The software is very easy to import recipes from the internet.  The mobile app makes it simple to get grocery lists and recipes on the go.  If you’re looking for a great way to organize all your recipes in one place then this software is for you.  I never plan to buy another hardcover cookbook again.  Whenever needed, the customer support is excellent.\n",

I don't think my taxes are all that difficult, but HR Block software just makes it so easy, and I'm typically done in a half hour or so.<br /><br />Frankly, I went with HR Block simply for the cost (they typically offer 50% discounts february-ish?), and the download from Amazon makes things so simple.

The standard Norton Security 2015 is remarkably similar to Norton 360 although without file backup. I simply installed a USB flash drive and now have my files being backed up automatically every week through Windows. A Norton representative graciously added the remaining 33 days on my current Norton 360 subscription to the new Norton Security 2015 upon request. I couldn't ask for more. As an added bonus, through Amazon's limited time offer, I was credited 15.00 on a different order I placed today just for purchasing Norton Security 2015 at an already low price. Now was the perfect time for me to upgrade my Norton security. Thank you Norton and Amazon!\n",

      "\n",
      "1\tThe program kept shutting down.\n",
      "3\tWell first of all, it was my mistake for not verifying this would run on Windows 10. It was a bad assumption on my part that software released 10 months ago would be compatible with the most recent Windows operating system . . . So there's that. Buyer be aware.<br /><br />So, since I've had good luck with buying AVG through Amazon before - did a two year license for the 2013 version - I thought I'd try a work around. I downloaded the free trial version directly from AVG then tried to activate it with the product key provided by Amazon. Got the message that the license had expired . . . interesting since I bought it four days ago.<br /><br />Never one to say die, I clicked &#34;activate&#34; anyway, which gave me an error box which sent me here - http://www.avg.com/us-en/license-expired. Apparently what Amazon gave me was a temporary sales number . . . not the worst thing ever, but if that's the case they sure as heck shouldn't call it the product key. Just saying.<br /><br />If you've made it this far, follow the directions on the AVG site to register and it will result in a usable license key. Maybe I had to go through this song and dance two years, but I can't remember - slept since then don't you know.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the difference is between the AVG 2015 I purchased through Amazon  - which comes with three application files by the way and no indication of which to use - and the version I got directly from AVG, but the Amazon purchase, even with three application files, still isn't compatible with Windows 10 even after registering and activating through AVG's website.<br /><br />Bottom line, I got antivirus protection for $20 and a lot of hoop jumping. I'm giving it the three stars for the pain in the butt factor.\n",

But customers have been asking me for input on Windows 10 for their businesses, so I purchased a copy and loaded it unto my Bootcamp drive on my (2014) MacBook Pro.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm impressed.  They have a few bugs to work out, and I've noticed that some websites really fail pretty hard in the new Edge browser, but 95% of my experience thus far has been positive. It looks and feels great.

It's entirely possible that what it read might have minor errors in the data that are not noticed by the software as an error.

I found that most of the questions and problems I encountered simply trying to make a DVD of a trip were simply not answered.

Their free upgrade to Premier version was over 4/20, another cheap trick they played. Then I thought I could fill out schedule D manually because I do not have many transactions. I found out that I cannot fill out schedule D even manually.<br /><br />This is a bad company. They always look for a way to gauging customers. Quicken used to let users download transactions from financial instituition. Around 2007, they blocked downloading without purchasing new version. I download my data to the software I own. Why do they ask me to buy another version. Since then, I switched to the free GNUCASH.<br /><br />I will pay for the premier gouging version since I have to finish my tax but this will be the last money Intuit see from me.

They responded quickly with a suggested resolution that ended up not working, so I emailed them again. They got back to me within 24 hours and gave me a solution that got me up and running again! I was terrified that I had lost all my recipes, but not the case. Everything is running smoothly again.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it for features as well as functionality.

I bought it again directly from Rosetta Stone and it was very complicated to download, so I had to contact Rosetta Stone and get the special instructions to be able to download it. So I paid for it two times in two days because Amazon would not contact me about it and I have no way to contact them again to get a refund. You have to pull files and go into run file and attach special coding to get it to load. Amazon sells it and will not explain any of this to you and won't respond when you ask how to download it.

      "1\tI've been a loyal user of TurboTax since 1998, following the nightmare I experienced the previous year wrestling with the infamously confusing Schedule D form. Now, 16 years later, I have decided to stop using TurboTax because they no longer include Schedule D in their standard (so-called &#34;deluxe&#34;) version of their software, plus they jacked up the price. #1 Rule of Good Business: Never downgrade your product and simultaneously increase its price. This year I have gone with H&R Block's tax software, which is cheaper and more fully functional... plus it imports my old TurboTax file. Take that, Intuit!

Every time I use a microsoft product I regret it any time I need service. Finally after 1 hour and fifteen minutes they told me I have to use a different credit card although my original card was valid.  They gave me one month credit for the time I spent on the phone.   That experience was with the Phillipines.  The service manager asked if everything was ok.  I said, if you get me an engineer to help me with a few things I'll be ok.  But make it simple.  I spent 15 minutes waiting to get someone from India who couldn't speak English.  I told her to get me someone from the United States.  It's now 20 minutes and waiting.   I just keep hearing the american voices from apple in my head.  Unfortunately at this point I'm stuck with Microsoft at work.  It's now 22 minutes and I'm starting to boil.  How long does it take to transfer a call from India to the US.  The point is that the product is good if you know how to use it. but don't expect any decent help from Microsoft.

MS Money no longer functioned after the upgrade, which was disappointing at first, and I figured it was time to transition to new software. I was worried the transition would be painful. Quicken 2015 did an awesome job converting my Money data making the transition easy.

If you install your .pst file, then the address book doesn't recognize it.  This has been a nightmare.  Why would I pay for an exchange email account when Microsoft has never had descent support for anything else.  I paid for outlook and can't get any customer service support that knows about any of my issues.  They just read the same script over and over again of things I've tried 100 a times.  Excuse the rant, I am just getting to the decision that I will have to migrate everything over to goolgle mail and contacts.  I've used outlook for 20 years.  Don't bother getting Outlook unless you want to pay for an exchange account.  It's not good enough that you pay out the yazoo for the program.  In order to use it you have to pay more money every month.  signed, a very unhappy and soon-to-be former microsoft outlook user.\n",

Their web site say this happens when you don't go through the programs renewal prompt's. I bought this through Amazon and was directed to the Norton site to download. So beware!  No one warned me of this! I would have waited 34 days before renewing!  UPDATE - I contacted Norton Support via online chat and they easily fixed my problem and gave me back the missing 35 days.

Once you understand its simple cognitive map, it is excellent.  (Yes, I have used Dreamweaver and WebPlus 8 is better for most people.)  And, yes, your sites will come together quickly and easily. The layout is WYSIWYG. It now has the ability to do Mobile-compliant sites through the templates in the Serif Resource Guide.  The links to PayPal, Youtube, Facebook, Pinterest, etc. are quick and easy. It has a straight forward shopping cart feature.  And, developing response forms is far easier than in any other package that I have used.  Serif will even host your WebPlus-designed site for you.  As a disclaimer, I do not work for or have any relationship with Serif software.  I am a professional marketing consultant and have been so for 35 years.

Well, I thought that whatever it had caused that problem had been worked out for the 2015 version because my computer was working fine until a couple days ago. Well it didn't. I just called Avast's tech support and after explaining what my problem was and what I have done so far, the very condescending technician questioned how could I be sure that it was Avast causing me the problem. I explained that I had already uninstalled and reinstalled Avast 3 times and that every time I uninstalled it Word and Outlook worked fine, and when I reinstalled Avast, Word and Outlook could not be launched.  He questioned how could I be sure there were no remains from other antivirus software I had previously used, and I told him that I had build this computer myself and that Avast was the only antivirus software I had ever used. He then said that he wasn't a Microsoft technician and that he could only help me with Avast, I explained again the troubleshooting I had done, and he asked me to wait so he could contact 2nd tier technical support to find out if this is something that Avast he could help with. When he came back on the phone, he indicated that they could help (He had just said they couldn't because they weren't Microsoft technicians) but they had two support programs, a one-problem-fix for $119, or a year's subscription to Avast's tech support for $179. It's much easier and cheaper to switch to a new software!\n",

      "1\tI was managing my accounts on Quicken 2014 Windows, and I transferred everything to Quicken 2015 on Mac.  It is a piece of crap.  The most basic tasks, such as keeping track of deposits and checks, do not work, or even worse, intermittently fails.  For instance, it is no longer able to reconcile a downloaded cleared check against a check entered manually, even though the check # as downloaded from my credit union is in the memo field.  Some downloaded transfers show up twice - is it because the date falls on a weekend?  Who knows.  What's the point of this software if I have to go over everything with a fine tooth comb and double check against my checking/savings account?  Quicken on Windows was not the greatest, but on Mac, it seems it was written by beginners.  Where is the Quality Assurance on this?

      "3\tI am satisfied with this product for for bank accounts.  I had offline data in another product which converted accurately.  Aside from a tedious time deleting downloaded duplicate transactions to get everything in sync setup was easy.  I find the reminder system to be rather nice.  I am not satisfied with this product for investments accounts, and am on the verge of giving up an going back to spreadsheets.  After several false starts I found a decent  methodology for getting share balances and basis in agreement with accounts.  It was tedious but doable to fill in recent transfers between bank accounts and investments.  Now, I'm having a terrible time filling in the transfers between investment accounts.  I can't find a way to do it and get correct tax and account balance reporting.  I do have questions in to the support group.  FOLLOW-UP:  I found by trial and error that the reporting on investment accounts works better if the first transaction in each investment account buys shares rather than transfers funds into the account.  I also found that a fairly complicated way to make both transfers between IRA's and IRA distributions work at the same time.  So, I've upgraded my rating by a star, though I still think getting started with investments is much more difficult than it needs to be.  This has been aggravated by my inability to get investment account registers to filter like the bank account registers.  In fairness to the product, investments require lots of difficult to implement capability.  On the other hand I paid extra for the capability.\n",

      "2\tAs a long time LibreOffice user, when I switched to Windows 10, I decided to give Microsoft Office 365 a shot. I love the idea of having apps on various devices and all syncing with the installation on my PC, and the $69 price tag for a year's subscription seemed quite reasonable. And there was a &#34;Get Office Now&#34; on my start menu. The stars seemed to align.<br /><br />I signed up for a Microsoft account and then selected the one month free trial just to make sure everything would work right. I installed the office suite, and ... none of the applications worked. Several of them just did nothing when I clicked on them. Word (the app I would use the most) just said it couldn't start, and then Excel (the app I would use the second most) told me there wasn't enough memory in my machine to load, and to install the 64-bit version instead.<br /><br />According to the Office installation screens, the 32-bit version is installed by default to preserve compatibility with some plug-ins.<br /><br />I uninstalled the 32-bit version of Office and installed the 64 bit version instead. This took a little finagling as I had to go into my Microsoft subscriptions and delete the PC installation, which was completely counter-intuitive. It's the same computer. Surely, MS collects identifying information (such as MAC address) to prevent software piracy. Why wouldn't MS know I was installing onto the same computer using the same account?<br /><br />Once installed, the 64-bit applications worked just fine, hence the two stars I'm willing to give this shoddy roll-out. However, because I had already registered my trial version, I couldn't use them. Office kept telling me I had already used a promotional license, and would have to pay for the product.<br /><br />It's been years since Bill Gates offered to resign from MS after a particularly shoddy version of Office for Mac. Decades later, and MS still can't get it together to make a promotional offer of its own software that ships withWindows 10 work on Windows 10. Microsoft plays a numbers game, and if the software works for you, then great. If it doesn't, you are totally hosed. This isn't great technology; it's poor technology. It's poor marketing, and it's poor customer relations.<br /><br />My advice is to skip Office 365 for now. Let other users suffer the heartbreak of application crashes and talking to call centers half-way around the world. I'm sure they'll get it sorted out. They just can't be bothered to do that BEFORE releasing it to the public. It's the production suite brought to you by the folks who gave you Clippy, Microsoft BOB, and Windows ME. They specialize in hits and misses. This release is a miss.\n",

      "2\tWindows 10 was designed to correct the design mistakes of Windows 8 and upgrade the popular Windows 7. In other words, it was to be the successor to Windows 7 with additional features and flashy designs.<br />.<br />In a nutshell, the new product does not confuse users with radical changes. True to legacy, the familiar features are present. There is a START BUTTON. Right click the START BUTTON will get a menu of familiar pages such as CONTROL PANEL, VIEW DEVICES AND PRINTERS, CHANGE DESKTOP BACKGROUND, and others. However, there are problems that discourage consumers to switch. They include the following:<br />.<br />1. Installing the Home Premium version was a complete failure. The free download upgrade version was impossible. After clicking the agreement box, the rotating blue arrow continued in an endless loop for hours - signifying that installation was taking place. After waiting three hours, I clicked the CANCEL BUTTON. Next, I downloaded the iso version on the Microsoft website, burned the image on DVD, and install that. On the final stage, the program &#34;locked up&#34; - typing the access password was impossible. A hard boot destroyed the installation and forced the computer to revert back to the previous Windows 7 OS. I tired again - three times - with the same results. . . . In the end, I gave up.<br />.<br />2. The Professional version did not experience the above. So, I was able to test it. Again, there were significant problems. Software compatibility was a major one. Firewalls, software drivers, and anti-virus programs did not work, especially Bit Defender and Commodo Internet Security. Microsoft Office 2003 and 2000 crashed and froze the computer. Macrium Reflect tried to construct an image of my Windows 10 partition. At 97% completion, the program hanged and everything froze. Hardware compatibility was &#34;the great game changer.&#34; My $3,500 Epson scanner was totally useless.<br />.<br />3. &#34;Teething problems&#34; were common as little errors erupted every week. The OS upgrades on Tuesdays would solve one error, but they also created new ones. One major irritant was a booting loop. Last week, the OS kept rebooting over and over until the fifth cycle. The user was stuck with the problem until the next Tuesday OS upgrade. There was no guarantee that anything would work afterwards. If not enough complaints were relayed to Microsoft engineers that week or if the problems were too complicated, the &#34;bugs&#34; were not fixed. Issues like these could be avoided if users were able to refuse the most recent OS upgrade and go back to the previous setting. Unfortunately, there was no option. Windows 10 forcefully made changes.<br />.<br />4. Missing were many useful programs that came with Windows 7, especially Windows Multimedia Player and gadgets. The former was essential. Click a video file, and it automatically played. The latter series were very useful. In front of me on the computer screen were over-sized icons that provided instant information: analog clock, calendar, weather, local weather reports for the week, memory and CPU usage, internet download and upload information, latest news flashes, and anything imaginable. In short, it is very hard to live without these.<br />.<br />5. If you are going to upgrade instead of installing from scratch, you need to commit two to three hours of uninstalling almost all of your old software and hardware drivers to avoid incompatibility problems. Almost everything has to go except Window 7, motherboard utilities, and video card drivers. Next, you activate the Windows 10 upgrade. This is followed by reinstalling everything.<br />.<br />6. The other choice - a clean install - is also a hassle. The booting hard drive has to be reformatted to GPT or Windows will not install.<br />.<br />7. The biggest concern is spelled out in Microsoft's 12,000 word Service Agreement: &#34;We will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to protect our customers or enforce the terms governing the use of the services.&#34;<br />.<br />In a nutshell, this gives MS the legal right to record and preserve all of your computer activities, internet searches, emails, and writings. There are two possible reasons for this. First, the company is able to collect the data and sort them. It is able to sell the information to marketers, who will directly focus their sales pitches to a ready market. Second, I suspect that this is necessary for the operation of CORTANA. This new HELP feature is like SIRI for the IPhone. You ask a question, and the computer will quickly provide the answer. In preparation, CORTANA has to record all of the user's computer activities and build an indexed database on the information. A quick search for the possible answers will enable CORTANA to provide a ready response if a question is asked in the future.<br />.<br />My biggest fears are the unknown and unpredictable possibilities that may come back and haunt the user in the future. Legally, the government and courts can force Microsoft hand over this information. So if I accidentally stumbled into a porn or ISIS site, or wrote notes for a school debate on terrorism, or received an unwanted email advertisement from a firm that specializes on questionable tax shelter plans, or received a misrouted TWITTER message from a militia group advocating the assassination of the President, can this provide the evidence against me in a future divorce hearing or trigger a FBI or IRS or Secret Service investigation?

They were no help and would NOT REFUND MY PURCHASE PRICE SINCE I DID NOT PURCHASE IT DIRECTLY AND BECAUSE IT WAS MORE THAN 60 DAYS AGO.  Makes no sense to me. H&R block spends millions in advertising.  Keeping an existing customer (4th year in a row - and last one) costs them less.  Just another big company that can't realize that consumers know have their own method of advertising -- its called product reviews.\n",

      "1\tI give this product one star even though I have been a user of Quicken since 2010, for a very simple reason: Intuit has taken the habit of forcing you to upgrade - there is no other word since you can't use the online download feature of your existing version if you don't upgrade - every year. That would be acceptable if they could have the decency to release bug-free products and significant new features. But they don't. The product is slower at every release, and where they could improve - with their reports, for instance - they don't. There is no way of archiving in a simple and effective way your oldest transactions in order to try to speed up the product. I chatted with their customer service during 60mn just to realize that I had been waiting for an answer that does not exist. I have thus decided to drop this product which was asking me to spend hours when I want to update my portfolio or even enter a simple transaction. Software is supposed to simplify your life, not complicate it. I don't know what the guys at Intuit are thinking about, but it looks to me like they see their customers as cash cows. Good for them, but without me.\n",

      "5\tCorel Painter is a MUST, if you are serious about digital art, as it's unparalleled in the way it mimics traditional media. I illustrate children's books and Painter is an important part of my arsenal of digital tools. I wouldn't want to be without it.<br /><br /> It seems like many new to digital art wonder whether they should purchase Photoshop or Painter or something else. Painter is a necessary tool if you want to create art more like the &#34;old-fashioned&#34; way (like you would in a real life art studio with real paints, etc.) and are not intimidated by having to learn a very robust, and deep program. Painter is the program where digital tools behave more like their counterparts in the real world. Watercolors &#34;dry&#34; on your digital canvas, you can mix oil paints just like you would real oil paints in an art studio, and the digital chalks have that &#34;chalky&#34; texture. Even the digital markers behave like real ones - going on somewhat transparently with overlapping strokes that become more opaque as you continue coloring. Painter has tons of tools with endless variations and the ability to customize to your heart's content. You get to play with acrylics, airbrushes, charcoal & conte, chalk, crayons, gels, gouache, liquid inks, pastels, sumi-e, watercolors, and lots more. There are even particle brushes that create amazing effects like smoke & dynamic fur, as well as pens that paint patterns of flowers, or chain, or even neon. There are also tools that mimic famous painter's styles like Van Gogh, Seurat, impressionist style, and so on. You could sit and &#34;play&#34; all day and not even go over ever possibility of every tool! You can even change all of the settings for each tool, to make it something really unique, and save your settings to use again and again. There are over 25 categories of brushes, each with a multitude of variants. I looked up the official number of brushes, and there are 806 (compare that to the 126 brushes in Painter Essentials)!! Look at the screenshot I uploaded of some of the paint marks I made with various brushes. I went through the categories and painted on the canvas with different ones, so you can see just a tiny bit of the options you'd have with Painter. It's like having an art store on your computer. You can even pick out different types of paper / canvas (smooth, textured, colored, whatever).<br /><br />You don't have to be a traditional artist to use Painter, though. Painter also has the capability to take a photograph and turn it into a painting using the multitude of brush options via cloning options. It also has tracing paper! Quick cloning is a time-saving tool I sometimes use to make some of the backgrounds for my illustrations. The computer does a lot of the work to turn a picture into a painting (in seconds or minutes) with all sorts of options to make things unique, but you can fine-tune it and add your own personal touches, so that it's not totally cheating, lol. The 2nd screenshot I uploaded (of a flower) is something I made using the tracing paper and the cloning tools. It took me about 4 minutes to create. With Painter you can create art that is nearly impossible to create in the &#34;real world&#34;. And it has an undo button. ;-)<br /><br />There are also Photoshop style tools, layer capabilities (like many layers of glass that overlap that you can draw/paint on), selection tools, vector pen tools, a paint bucket (to dump color or patterns like plaids and so on onto your canvas or into a selection), color correction, and other digital tools you can find in just about any digital photo / art program. You really don't want to use Painter for photo editing though. That's more of a job for Photoshop. Painter is for…well painting, lol, (and drawing, sketching, airbrushing, etc.). You can paint and draw in Photoshop, but that's not its original design purpose. I use both (along with Manga Studio / Clip Studio Paint, Krita, Illustrator, and Sketchbook Pro). Theyare all important tools that excel in different things.  Another reviewer likened the Painter and Photoshop to a hammer vs. a screwdriver, and he's spot on. I have to have Photoshop to accomplish specific tasks Painter just can't do (a lot of image manipulation and that type of thing). I have to have Painter to mimic the real life painting techniques that Photoshop just can't do. Bottom line is if you want to paint, get Painter. If you want to do digital art that is more about manipulating images, get Photoshop (if you can stomach the nasty subscription model they moved to - I personally am sticking with Photoshop CS6, until I can find an alternative).<br /><br />Please note that (in my opinion / experience) Painter is NOT the best for inking (think comic book style drawing). I've found that Manga Studio (which is also known as Clip Studio Paint) is better for that, in that the lines are nice and better stabilized (there is a slider that will make it so it will auto correct tiny jitters as you draw). It is also not the best if you just want to sketch. Getting Painter to sketch is overkill and there are other programs that are better for drawing. I think Painter is truly BEST suited for PAINTING (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.).<br /><br />If you are NEW to digital art, I recommend getting your feet wet, first, in something like Sketchbook Pro (or Painter Essentials) that is much more inexpensive and easier to use. Sketchbook Pro is easy enough for a child to use. You can literally sit down, open it up and start sketching and drawing in no time (you can take a look at my review here on Amazon, under my profile). The basic tools are intuitive from the outset and It's very freeing not to have to learn all sorts of complicated controls & commands, etc. , especially for a beginner. You can try it to see if you like digital art, and then, if you do, you might be interested in pursuing something like Painter to take a step in a more professional direction.  Painter is a quite a bit more of a challenge with endless options that can be daunting to a new user, but Corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started. Also, if you would like to learn how to use it quickly, I recommend getting a month's subscription to Lynda.com. They have a great beginning video course on how to use Painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them. I've been using Painter for about 15 years, and even I learned something from the Lynda.com video for the 2015 version.<br /><br />Please note, if you are interested in purchasing Painter, you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a Wacom Intuos, or Cintiq. This is not a program to use with a mouse (imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse!). You need a digital pen in hand. I have used it with both of the above. Painter works very well with Wacom tablets and responds to the tilt, speed, pressure, etc. of the Wacom pens. There are less expensive tablet options (Yiynova, Huion, etc.) but they are not (in my opinion) as good as Wacom. If you have something like a Surface Pro, you can already draw directly on the screen. Anyway, the point is, you need something to draw with other than a mouse. ;-)<br /><br />If you already have Painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it, for me it was. The brushes are MUCH faster (no more lag time), the brushes track better, and the new particle brushes are amazing (and fun to play with, lol). I recommend trying the 30 day free trial to see if the upgrades are worth it, which is what I did. The increase in speed alone was so worth it for me (I'm on a bit of an older computer so lots of my art programs lag if I have a really big brush, etc.).<br /><br />Also, don't be afraid to get Painter as a digital download if you are like me and want the instant gratification of receiving your purchase right then and there, lol. I've purchased software downloads from Amazon numerous times, with no hitches.<br /><br />If, after reading this review, you have any questions, please ask via the comment button below. I'll be happy to try and help out!<br /><br />Bottom line: Painter is a worthwhile program that is the best at mimicking real life media, but especially paint. If you want to take your digital art to the next level, or want something that will behave more like the &#34;real&#34; stuff, and less like digital tools, this is what you are looking for. Just keep in mind that there is a LOT to learn, and if you are a beginner you might be best served by a less expensive program, to start with. Painter is an amazing tool that helps me create my illustrations, and I highly recommend it, with that particular reservation in mind.

      "4\tI disagree with the negative reviews. I have paid so much more when Illustrator was a separate application or when I had to purchase the Creative Suite to get the tools I needed. Maybe those other's do not remember the $1200 and more  prices for the applications which would renew about every two years, and then you had to pay an upgrade of about $600.<br />This works out better mathematically. And with the subscription plan, all the latest updates and improvements are easier to install.<br />If you use the application for a hobby, consider the costs of other hobbies - anyone played golf lately? Or how about skiing.<br />I use Illustrator for so many projects I cannot imagine not having it handy. The engineers at Adobe have spent a lot of time improving the application since I first learned to use it as Illustrator 88 and paid a lot more for it. However, because I use several of the other applications, the best deal is the full Creative Cloud. That way I have a full version of Acrobat and more. And the full version of Acrobat has so many uses these days.\n",

This is about as unethical as it gets.<br /><br />As far as operating? This still runs slower than the previous versions (360, NIS), though they claim it's &#34;better&#34;<br /><br />Get with it Norton, quit making customers wait forever to deal with your website.

When you do your first photo with your watermark,  dragging and dropping your next photo will use the watermark of the first, if that is what you want.  Ebay uploads of photos does not like this watermarks software “jpeg” format.  I had to load the photo in my Print Shop software and  export as a new “jpeg” format to get it to work on Ebay.<br /><br />My best advice!

You have to start from scratch and it only uploads or downloads with it's own file extension (.rsm), so you can't open or edit it in Microsoft Word!  So how are prospective employers supposed to open it??<br /><br />In addition, the suggestions and instructions seemed rather remedial and entry level to me.  I'm an experienced technical sales professional, and after being out of the game for a few years I was looking to sharpen my resume.  When I selected just &#34;sales&#34; as an occupation to see what came up, there were no examples listing B2B or Business to Business which is a very common term and phrase for a lot of sales positions.  There were however plenty of examples like &#34;roofing sales&#34;, or my favorite &#34;Toilet Preparations Sales Representative&#34;.  I found Medical Sales Person and the example was in a very basic format and just listed a long list of bullet statements, which were also very basic and non-descriptive in my opinion.  I will say that the seem to have a limitless choice of &#34;designs&#34; (many of which were over the top), but what's the point if your content is weak.<br /><br />So my overall opinion is this software is targeting entry level positions or job seekers that have no resume building skills whatsoever.

They provided no way to upgrade so i waited until my time ran out and considered going to another Security Suite.  But I didn't I do like the way this works and I have used Norton for a long time. Folks it works put in a little time and learn how to use it and keep it updated and you will be better off. Amazon provides you the new key and the price is right for the consumer. I will probably reorder next year.\n",
      "1\tProduct is OK, support is incompetent. They apparently outsource to India and the people designated to help you are absolutely clueless.  I was using Symantec Endpoint for years with no issue and just switched to Norton.  All of a sudden I can no longer share folders between 2 home PC's.  I disable smart firewall, and voila - problem solved.  I changed 2 settings to cure the issue: 1) I set Network Trust to &#34;Full Trust&#34; and 2) I added each PC as a Trusted Device on the opposite PC's list.  This works for a few hours, and then the &#34;Smart&#34; firewall blocks access again without any warning or change in the settings.  I chatted with support online and they spent 45 mins giving me the same fix, without understanding that I already took the prescribed steps 3 times.  Next I called for support.  I explained the issue, the man took a few minutes and told me &#34;sorry, I can't handle this - I will have to escalate your case (CASE # 23482090) and have a supervisor call you back.  I've been waiting all day for a call and nothing.  This is simple, straightforward functionality - Folder Sharing between 2 home PC's.  I had no issues with this using Endpoint (a more complex program), but with Norton it just doesn't work properly and no one can tell me why.  Other than that the product seems to work fine, but does a few strange things like telling me that threats were dealt with without ever letting me find out what those supposed threats were.  Also, pop ups get annoying at times - especially those for browser plugin protections.\n",

So much so that it took me almost a whole day to try and come from behind to upload this new AVAST Antivirus program. Thinking the entire time I was probably too late to save the computer from an eminent take over from this virus.<br />Once the AVAST program was successfully installed. It took aproximatelly 30 minutes to control my computers system and bring it back to normal use.<br />This computer is actually a replacement to my last one in which was attacked and destroyed by a virus....I sure wish I had AVAST at the time!!!<br />Anyway.

When I asked my friend for some help figuring out my trouble with a video she couldn't believe what a pain the 13 version was to work with.

      "3\tI am giving this 3 stars based on my experience transitioning from Quicken for Windows to Quicken for Mac. If you were starting as a new user on this product it would probably be worth 4 stars.<br /><br />1. The conversion tool for converting my Windows Quicken file to be compatible with the Mac Quicken did not work. Based on some internet searching it appears it is not compatible with Windows 8. I had to open a help ticket with Quicken, upload the file to their site, then download a file they manually converted. After conversion I had to do some significant work to make sure my investment account balances were correct after the first synchronization. In the end things worked out, and I assume their process is secure, but I was not that comfortable with uploading all my financial data to their site.<br /><br />2. This software is not exactly equivalent to the windows version. I will be able to work with it, but there definitely was a moment I considered giving up and just sticking with keeping a Windows computer around the house just for Quicken. Account reconciliation is completely different in this version, and makes no sense to me. Transfers between accounts do not automatically link. This confused me at first, but ultimately I think this is ok. As far as I can tell this is missing asset allocation reports for the investments, which could be a deal-breaker if I can not figure out how to use them in this version, so I may still abandon this product. Long story short, plan to make adjustments to the way you use Quicken if you switch to the Mac version.\n",

I have never had it do anything to my email.

I couldn't even access google and yahoo sites.(Really).  Told me they were security risks.<br /><br />I did a scan and it came up clean.<br /><br /> Maybe it was an incompatible browser ( I use Firefox) but after a couple hours of trying to get it straight I deleted it and went back to McAfee. ( I know no one likes McAfee but it works great for me). I'm not going to reestablish everything on a new browser.<br /><br />So for me it was  a waste of money and time.

      "5\tI used to upgrade every other version of Creative Suite, so I can definitely appreciate the negative reviews of CC. However, since I've starting working with CC, my workflow and my creative capabilities have increased. I love the ability to immediately upgrade individual Adobe desktop apps, and have the ability to install and log onto more than one computer. One of my favorite options of CC is the accessibility of my photos from anywhere, on any device!!! I find myself sharing photos from my desktop computer with my iPhone/iPad apps. I use it to share photos with clients, or to transport files when I do not have an external drive. It's as simple as dragging and dropping a file into a folder on my computer. I use Lightroom extensively for organizing my photography, so I love the accessibility of LR Mobile. I can take photos on my iPhone, and sync them via the cloud with my LR catalog on my desktop computer. In addition to sharing and syncing photos, I am also fond of Syncing Settings from apps such as Photoshop, so I always have my personal Actions and custom brushes available on any computer I happen to be using. I never have to worry about recreating any of them, or making sure I have them on an external drive. This also applies to fonts [Type Kit] that I am using on designs, which are shared between Illustrator, Photoshop, Muse and InDesign, and included in CC.  Most of the negative comments found here have to do with the subscription pricing, and I can appreciate where those people are coming from, but you get so much for the dollar.\n",
      "5\tPrice is right.  Not intrusive like many other security packages I have tried.  I have had 0 viruses in the last couple of years using PCMatic.

      "5\tSpot on!\n",
      "4\tI finally made the decision to move from Apple Aperture to Lightroom. I was reluctant to move as I loved the organization of Aperture over Lightroom. Sure LR had more editing features, but for me organization was more important than editing.<br /><br />What sold me was now that LR6 has the ability to use search for smart albums. No prior version of LR could use that feature. If you have several thousand of pictures, it is a challenge to find them.<br /><br />I had tossed between the CC and the standalone version of LR. My decision was the cost per features did not warrant the price, and I prefer to have access to my photos without being restricted in a subscription contract. I compared the full releases dates on LR, and that buying standalone versions ever time it is released is cheeper than a CC subscription, as long as they price is the same as of this writing.<br /><br />Here are some of the other features I found useful and improvement from Aperture<br />-Cropping using the Golden Rule Ratio<br />-Key wording suggestions<br />-Extensive developing editing features.<br />-Curves shows how the tone light will be effected without having to guess<br />-Powerful adjustments. I have been able to recover blown out highlights, grain, and soft focused images in LR that was never possible in Aperture. These does make LR somewhat aggressive, so you have to be careful not do go to heavy handed with adjustments.<br />-Auto Exposure and Leveling<br /><br />I also appreciate how LR has slowly taken the highlight features of Aperture such as facial recognition, GPS mapping, and printing books.<br /><br />There are a few features that I missed that are not quite available in Aperture<br />-Full screen editing, when you use full screen you can only adjust tags like stars and colors, but that is about it. I loved the full screen editing using Aperture<br />-Zooming in at 100%. It takes LR longer to show these views than Aperture. I find this critical for choosing the sharpest image of a set that I shoot. This slows down the process for me<br />-No shortcut key for Purple color Label<br />-There is no Orange color label like in Aperture<br />-You cannot stack images in Collection albums, only directly in the Folders box. These slows down the editing process<br />-Deleting pictures is somewhat clunky as you have to click in a dialog box or use Shift+Control+Command+Delete. This is somewhat clunky. I liked how Aperture had a Deleted Trashcan folder to make sure if you made a mistake. In LR, you have to go to the actual Trashcan in your Mac to recover it. I have made several mistakes accidentally deleting pictures<br />-You can only compare original master and the adjustment in Development mode. Aperture was able to do it in any mode<br />-Aperture had a means of adjusting keyboard shortcuts. I have not yet seen a means how to adjust shortcuts or add them for missing ones (like tag Purple)<br /><br />While LR is not completely the same as Aperture, it has enough similar features and an extensive more than Aperture that made it fun to use some days.<br /><br />That said, I have had it crash on my me a few times. Aperture had never crash on me. It is a small thing, but annoyance.<br /><br />For a side note, I got the Exporter for Aperture on the Mac App Store. This add made it extremely easier for you to migrate your photo into a different platform such as Lightroom. I highly recommend it for those changing from Aperture and moving to LR.<br /><br />Hope this helps other Aperture uses for making a decision.e of a set that I shoot.

The Ultra11 version still works fine on the same Computer (I did not delete that version yet until I see if Ultra15 is going to work out). I sent my complaint to Customer Service and it requested some technical information which I fully sent to the Technician but all he did was advise me to go into General setting & select auto resume! I explained to him that I Already informed him that it doesn't work. He just wasted my time & it takes days before they reply back. Poor Customer service.He doesn't seem to know what he is doing. It is very annoying and I find myself going back to Version 11 Ultra to play DVDs when I play a DVD & do not have time to finish the Movie & quit early. The DVD always resumes in Ultra 11.

I spoke to about 6 different techs over the course of 2 weeks, who just wanted to sell another product and weren't listening to the fact that I had a receipt showing that I had purchased it.

Well, except for the guy who wrote a book on using Adobe products and, astoundingly, states the price is $50 per year instead of $50 per month.

I then did a search and found the download from Microsoft for  .NET 4.0 - and ran the installer and the result as I expected is that it won't install because I have .NET 4.5 installed and need it for other software so I can't un-install 4.5 to be able to install 4.0 and apparently Quicken 2015 won't work with .NET 4.5.

Is it .NET v 4.0 or ?<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:28:52 a.m.<br />  Yes, it's .NET 4.0.<br />  8:29:04 a.m.<br />  Please hold on Chuck.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:30:37 a.m.<br />  I really don't understand if this required then why doesn't INTUIT provide the software with the installation. It is a redistributable package available from Microsoft.<br />Marjorie P<br /><br />  8:32:27 a.m.<br />  For you to install that requirement Chuck, you need to contact the Microsoft.<br />  8:32:43 a.m.<br />  They have also an official page.<br />  8:32:57 a.m.<br />  I'm looking for it.<br />  8:33:11 a.m.<br />  Here's the link, https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/<br /><br />Chuck Atkinson<br /><br />  8:33:11 a.m.<br />  You know what !!! - This is ridiculous.

Should've seen the storm brewing right from there because nothing is ever easy. So once installed and I did a little exploring to get a good feel for the software and I was actually enjoying myself and quickly started falling for it when out of know where my screen blacks out...after a few minutes of trying to figure out if a cable managed to come loose or something went wrong my screen comes back to life and shows my tower running threw boot up. Thinking this was a minor fluke I dealt with frequent crashes and having to constantly unplug and re-plug in my network adapter because after every crash it would know longer recognize the driver so it would have to reinstall every time this happens and I'm talking LIGHT use ranging from a couple tabs open on web browser to just sitting on the dashboard. So after a week of dealing with this and only one update (which was released the next day the OS was released another red flag) I decided to reinstall WIN 7 but oh wait couldn't just do an upgrade because that would actually be a &#34;downgrade&#34; so OS wouldn't allow it so getting ready to do a back up and clean install when the OS crashed every single time I started copying files to and external drive after the fifth time i gave up and just deleted this garbage off of my computer.

He told me that it was going to be a lengthy process to reinstall and also would need to rewrite some hidden system files on my computer.  He sent me the links but was not allowed to stay on the line while I did the updates.  After multiple tries, and several calls to the help desk, my computer was incapacitated for most of the day.  At 6pm, when my programmer husband came home from work, he took over, wrote some of his own code and got the program running.  (Glad that I have access to a computer geek at home!)  This was a nightmare.  The actual program, now that it is running is good, but it was a nightmare to get it installed.  That is a whole day of my life that I will never get back!!\n",

I was on the phone with Microsoft twice for hours at a time and on chat with them a couple more times to boot.  For what ever reason when I had this piece of crap on my hard drives explorer.exe kept stealing focus away from the active program making the system almost unusable.  I checked drivers, I checked BIOS settings, I reflashed the BIOS to make sure it was up to date, I reinstalled about 5 times, the &#34;tech&#34; from Microsoft installed Win10 over the top of Win10.  No luck, no resolution to the problems I was having.  What a waste of money and time.  Now I have to rebuild my system almost from scratch and I am not a happy camper.

So far, it is working really well with the new upgrade to Windows 10 on my Lenovo Flex 3.<br /><br />Because I didn't want to take my expensive wireless headset from the office I also bought a very reasonably priced headset that was approved for use with Dragon. I am in fact writing this review using the new headphone and my new copy of Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 13.0.

I am happy to see Amazon's unlimited storage offer (comparing to others) with very competitive pricing and no limit on photo size or type of files. I have over 6TB of photos (most in raw format) and videos created over the years and have been looking for online back-up solutions. I signed up the 3-month trial and subsequently decided to stay with it. Guess what, after 4 months, I am still unable to complete my first round of uploading. Why? The software sucks! Big time. It constantly gets stuck and requires attention, either pause and resume, or restart again. It becomes a daily chore. Don't tell me this is because of my internet connection. I have other sites (like smugmug, photoshelter, flicker, you name it), all you need to do is to drop the files and walk away. It may take hours but they will get the job done for you. Another example is to upload big video files to the video sites like Vimeo or YouTube, I can upload a multi-GB video file in one shot without any problem. While on Amazon, 90% chance is that you will get a spinning wheel and you have to try it again and again. Tech support is none existence. Seriously, any smart highschool kid can create better software than this. What a shame.\n",
      "5\tI don't do a lot of video recording these days, but when I do, I want it to be quick to setup and simple to use, but still be able to provide good quality. My PC desperately needs some upgrades; so right now I can't record AA games with Fraps because I'm already struggling with performance and Shadowplay is even worse. Tested this out with Witcher 3 and no problems, woo!<br /><br />Recording video goes up to 2560x1980 resolution (which I haven't seen before), records at 60FPS (or whatever lower number you choose) and in .avi or .wmv. You can also turn off capturing the cursor, which is super nice. Microphone can be recorded in a second audio track, making it easier to clean up and apply later - not that anyone particularly wants to hear my charming Welsh accent.<br /><br />It also lets you save screenshots in any of the 4 formats (bmp, jpg, png, gif) which I like and I streamed for several hours to a friend direct to Twitch, which was way easier for me, as a very small-scale streamer than setting up xSplit, although I think overall there were less options/customisability - you can still use the overlay to add webcam direct through D3DGear.<br /><br />I've been using Fraps for around 5 years now, and whilst it is easy to use, the one major drawback (for me) is the absolutely massive file size. D3DGear records and compresses, thus making files a fraction of the size which makes storage much easier for me. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's an improved fraps meets a simplfied XSplit.<br /><br />There's a free 15 day trial on their website, so you don't have to take my word for it - if you're interested in recording or streaming you should definitely check it out.<br /><br />Note: I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but own and have tested it extensively through Steam.\n",

      "2\tI enjoy a lot of the options on this product, such as the ability to move loops around and put effects on recorded audio (if you fish around in the effects menus), but there are a lot of issues that need to be worked on. For one thing, the loop engines they show in the demos on their website are NOT included in this program, or are a different version, which makes their tutorials a little confusing when you try to use the engines yourself. I've used the thing way more than I probably should, written MIDI stuff on it, and recorded voice, and most of the time it's pretty straightforward, but I've also had to remove it from my PC and redownload it 5 times now, and each time the VST components don't load the same way. I'm not sure why, and I haven't taken the time to fight with it or ask customer service about it, but it makes it difficult to keep using the program the way I want to, and frankly, I'm tired of trying. So yes. It gives you a good platform for manipulating sounds, but it isn't exactly reliable - which, if you read any of the other negative reviews, comes up a lot. You can't import or export .xhl music (written on a notation program like Finale, for example), either, which would be really handy for someone trying to go from notation to audio, or vice versa, but that's just me. I don't think I'll bother downloading this again for a sixth time. I'm moving on, people. Thanks for a learning experience.\n",

The Malwarebytes is installed by a 3rd party installation program, or downloaded from Malwarebytes website. I didn't notice any other software being installed. Although Malwarebytes does install, in TRIAL mode, the shortcut created by the seller on the desktop is a huge amount of characters. This is highly unprofessional and creates all sorts of issues with the 255 character limit imposed by Windows (try copying or backing up). Amazon and the seller both say the item is NOT returnable. I believe Amazon should be doing a much better job screening items like this, or changing their return policy on bogus software licenses.\n",

Having been an Adobe software user for over 20 years, I think this subscription program is wonderful.

It will continue to work just as it had in the past, but if you don't renew, you don't get access to new features.  (Duh, just like not upgrading from CS5 to CS6. . . .)<br /><br />When you do a dollar-for-dollar comparison, the subscription model makes great financial sense.  In the past, you paid full price for a program, then you paid a smaller fee every 18 months or so for upgrades.

This year, after I filed my 2014 tax returns, I realized I had forgotten to include an income item.  I logged into TurboTax and generated an Amended Return.  However, despite the fact that the program indicated that it would print only the forms required for filing, it printed every single tax form.  I sent numerous emails to TurboTax asking for help and received only canned responses that were not helpful.  I then tried deleting the Amended Return.  I followed the instructions provided by TurboTax and now my originally filed 2014 tax returns are incorrect AND I am unable to generated a new Amended Return.  I cannot even see the forms for previous tax years in the &#34;vault&#34; as TurboTax won't let me access the vault. I have sent yet another message to TurboTax but I am expecting to receive yet another canned, unhelpful response.  I will be researching other tax preparation software options for 2015.

      "1\tThis was a horrible experience.  I reserved Windows 10 Pro for three computers (one laptop, two desktops)  that have been running Windows 7 Ultimate since it came out.  I have always been an AVID Microsoft and Windows fan.  I have vowed to never let my fingers touch a MAC.  I loved Windows XP, hated Vista as much as Apple, and most of all I really loved Windows 7.  I never bothered with Windows eight because it looked like it was primarily meant for Tablets and other touch screen devices.  However, after reading the reviews and an opportunity to try Windows 10 for free, I reserved the product for all three computers.  I was notified in two days that it was available for my laptop and I downloaded and installed the upgrade. It went well and I started to try it out.  Wow! I was really impressed and called several friends and family to tell them.  I was so excited about it, that I decided to not wait for the upgrade from the APP and went online to download the upgrade for one of my desktops from Microsoft manually.  MISTAKE Number 1.  After it was installed, I found I couldn't do certain things with it because it wasn't activated.  When I went to activate it, it sent me to the store and wanted $199 for a key. I decided no way was I paying for something I could get for free so I went to restore Windows 7.  I told the restore program to save my files which it would do, but then I got a message that all my APPS including MS Office would be deleted  and I would have to reload all of them.  Fortunately, all my computers have backup drives and before installing the upgrade, I had saved an image file of my old setup so that's what I did while I was waiting for MS to notify me that my program was ready for installation.  Later that day I went to edit a Word file on my Windows 10 laptop and when I tried to save it, I got a message that it was a read only file and I would have to save it under a different name.  I tried that and got another message that I was not authorized to edit files.  I got the same response in Excel and Access.  Of course you can't get any support from MS on the phone any more but I checked the forums and found others with the same problem. I was told I could edit the permissions section (fortunately I am the only one using this computer) so that anyone could have full access.  I did this and it solved that problem.  Then I found I lost the Start Menu and Cortana.  The Icons were still there, but the programs wouldn't come up.  You can no longer manually set up a restore point, but they had made a Critical Update and I was able to restore to that point.  Now I had Cortana and the Start Menu back, but I was getting read only files again.  I was going to try to reset the permissions again, but first I had to post some financial stuff on Quicken.  Lo and behold I got the same read only message on it.  That was the final straw.  I can't spend my life fighting a computer.  I already knew I was going to have to restore my old image file and that's what I did.  I still love Windows 7 and it looks like I'll be using it a long time.<br /><br />MICROSOFT, YOU LET ME DOWN!

      "1\tPROS  - all hardware is working well - Windows Apps now contained in desktop view. - Like the notification area and improved quick access to settings - like the clean look of the Windows 10 UI. - After all this time and thousands of upset users, they bring back the start menu - no crashes - start up time has improved with updates  CONS  - very difficult install when upgrading from Windows 7 (fix below) - Screen saver and auto monitor turn do not work at first (fix below) - no cloud sync for Edge bookmarks - no cloud sync for Start menu - If you are using WI-FI on desktop, you have to restart to enable a wired network connection - really would like the option to go back to Windows 7 start menu.  All they've done is taken the Windows 8 start menu and crammed it into a smaller space.  You could also navigate quicker through the Windows 7 start menu with just the keyboard. - You can only select the WIFI network through the smaller wifi icon.  The larger icon will only turn WIFI on and off. - I like the look of the Edge browser but the lack of cloud sync still makes Google Chrome the best. - If you use Office 2013 then what is the point of the Microsoft apps? - Microsoft needs to wake up and provide better support for Google products. - Outlook 2013 still does not sync rules you create - Any tags you create in One Note 2013 can't be viewed in online or mobile One Note - No skype app - One drive is unreliable and frequently has sign in errors on Android  Microsoft is just too far behind in the Mobile market.  And by the time they come out with universal apps, Google will have something bigger and better out.  Windows 10 looks better than previous versions but at the core it just feels average.  Basically, I feel like I’m mainly upgrading to get a nicer looking interface but no major feature improvements.  Now if you’re a huge Windows phone fan and are willing to wait 6 months to a year for universal apps and pray they aren’t crap, then you’ll get good value out ofthis upgrade.  But if you’re are Android user, then you might not get a great deal out of Windows 10.  I just can’t overlook the advantages and more features that Google products offer.  I’m also thinking of looking at the Chromebooks.  :)  Heck, if Adobe products worked on Chromebooks, then there would I see no reason for me to own a Windows PC.  FIXES ================================  So basically it took me about 4 to 5 tries and finally got help from someone.  Here are the steps that finally lead to a successful install: - - Windows update is set to NOT check for updates. - - Deleted the $Windows. BT and WS folder under C: - - also deleted from the downloads folder in windows/softwaredistribution - -  Deleted items in the datastore folder under software distribution - - ran windows update MANUALLY from the control panel - - came up with error ... searched for error on google and ran windows update checker - - ran windows update, that took awhile - - double checked all three folders and deleted new updates that showed up in the windows/softwaredistribution downloads folder - - clicked &#34;install windows 10&#34; and skipped the other updates  Hopefully that helps anyone that is having issues.  Seems like the problem is with the 4 folders that have temp files in them.  Not sure why this blocks the installation.  After install, I have problems where Cortana and the Start Menu wouldn't load.  I removed Avast, went with Windows Defender and Malwarebytes and that helped.  If your having the same problem, the recent updates might help as well.  So far IOBIT system suite works well with Windows 10.  Now the biggest problem I'm having is the computer will not automatically go into sleep and the screen saver is not working. UPDATE:  To fix this problem you have to disable the gaming joystick in the device manager.  UPDATE:  Installed the new November update and now have run into the BSOD and no way to get into safe mode and no roll back options work.  It looks like I'll have to do a HP reset to Windows 7.  So the only option was to reset back to Windows 7.  Most of my files are stored in the cloud and I'm happy to be back to Windows 7.     This is the worst experience with software I've ever had.  I'm now thinking I should pay closer attention to Apple computers.        I know its not recommended to install Windows in the early stages but at the same time, this is released as a final product that they are charging for.     They shouldn't be charging for this AT ALL and it should be put into beta version.    Microsoft is a joke when it comes to mobile and if they think that releasing unstable incomplete software is ok, then I'm concerned about their future.\n",

Although you can see what your annual spending looks like, the software doesn't allow for you to budget annually. You can only budget monthly. Intuit wants its users to buy into their online service where you have to pay by month to use it. One positive feature is that the program downloads from your online bank accounts really fast. Unless, you are willing to go to Quickbooks, you will not get the functionality of a robust personal accounting program. I am sorry I paid for this without knowing this fact and paid for Quicken. I will use Quickbooks software instead, but also fear that the company with dumb down the software in order to lure users to their monthly online service...\n",

      "1\tZero Stars...the idea of unlimited cloud storage for my photos is very attractive and more than worth the cost of Prime membership.  What beggars belief, however, is the execution of this...this app would fail a programming 101 course it's so inept.  No desktop integration, constantly redirecting to the browser (where the functionality is equally poor), limited coverage of industry RAW file formats...who knew Olympus was a major camera manufacturer?  clearly not Amazon...slow upload speeds, poor performance on rendering image previews on web interface.  Once the photos are on there, the interface is also awful.  Very disappointed so far...really want to like this, but the software and basic functionality is undermining a terrific idea....can only hope Amazon has some grand plan waiting in the wings, otherwise I'll not be hanging around for very long.\n",

      "3\tI've been an Avast subscriber for about three years, including two paid subscriptions. If my use of this anti-virus, anti-malware program is an admission of liking, then this comment comes in the form of a complaint. The amount of advertising and pop-up interruptions Avast provides since it became the antivirus, anti-malware leader about four years ago has gone up. If the company that made this program listened to my comment, it should know that the reason for me picking it was because it ran in the background without interruption, except upon starting up my computer, to which it only said the few words, &#34;Avast virus database is now updated.&#34; And, those words were the only words I'd ever wanted to hear. Now that my credit card expired for my bank's replacement card, I am happy that the company cannot charge me automatically for the new paid subscription that I now refuse due to interruptions. I decided to take my business elsewhere. Thanks to Avast, but no thanks.\n",

      "5\tI used the trial before purchasing Lightroom 6 and after seeing the improvements I was able to make to my photos I knew I would need this program. I am not a professional photographer but I appreciate getting nice prints of my photos and this program has made a difference. I was using Corel Paintshop Pro 7 but I am not interested in creating layers or applying special effects to my photos so that's why I started using Lightroom. It takes a little time and practice to use the program but the results are worth it. I have used Tony Northrup's book and online videos to understand the program better and within a few weeks I have been able to really notice a difference in my photos. The lens correction features for the different camera profiles and lenses is great. But I think the best feature is that you won't end up with tons of duplicate photos after you have made adjustments. The ability to modify/adjust a photo without altering the original is brilliant and definitely saves on hard drive space. With all of my photo information being readily available I can review a shot and learn what I need to change in my settings the next time I go out shooting. Because of this I am getting better with learning my camera settings and requiring less adjustment to my photos. I think it is a great way to learn photography. It has enough settings though and there are certainly enough presets available on the internet if I want to totally change the mood of a photo. I'm definitely enjoying this program and learning some many ways to improve my photography.\n",
      "4\tI used Quicken a very long time ago (like in the 90s) and recently decided to start using it again to help me organize my finances.  Here are a couple things I found very helpful:<br /><br />-Mobile : Quicken Deluxe 2015 allows you to use the mobile app for free.  You need a Quicken account and once that's established, your client version (Quicken on your personal computer) syncs your account(s) registration entries on the cloud (Quicken Cloud).  Your mobile device syncs to the cloud as well and allows you to track not just the money your spending, but where the transaction took place and the ability to take pictures of your receipt.  The resolution of the picture is fine.  Viewing it from your client requires you to download the picture if you want to zoom in and out.<br /><br />-One Step Update : This feature is extremely helpful for me because I'm way too busy to deal with my transactions manually.  Quicken has a One Step Update that allows me to download all my transactions automatically from my bank accounts, credit cards, loans and retirement account.  It was very easy to setup for me.  Sometimes I have to run the update a few times because something went wrong when trying to connect to the institution's server.  I experience that when I go directly to the institution's website, so I'm pretty sure it's not entirely Quicken's fault or even that it's their fault at all.  At the very least they give you an explanation of what happened.<br /><br />So why a four start and not a five star?  My bank actually charged me a fee for connecting Quicken to my bank.  It came in the form of an online fee.  I should have known better and this is not Quicken's fault at all either.  Would be nice if Quicken had the ability to flag banks that charge for the connection fee.  Maybe they do and I just don't know about it.  If someone can show me that they do, I'll will switch this review to a five star because I really like this app.\n",

When I couple this with the major frustrations with TurboTax and the errors it caused on my tax return, I am done with Intuit.  All they are continuously raising pricing on software that doesn't work.  My opinion is that all the added features simply make the base product more unusable.\n",

The list of issues seems endless: routine failure to connect to accounts (with helpful suggestion to &#34;try again later&#34;), accounts that sync incorrectly with other accounts and thus throw off the balances, a mobile solution that doesn't function consistently with the desktop version wrt to how it counts spending and income, not to say anything of connection issues as well. If Quicken wasn't the only game in town for the kind of accounting I need, I'd have left a long time ago. C'mon Intuit - you can do much better than this!\n",

Even if you wanted to upload folders one bye one .. it will get disconnected after some time for no particular reason or error message<br /><br />I dont understand if amazon do not want us to upload large data folders why they are offering unlimited storage they can say that on starting you have 1TB or 2TB and it will grow few GBs per month thats also fine<br /><br />its disappointing to see such app from someone who created AWS and known for customer first policy\n",

Eventually I got all green lights and was set up and ready. This really only took less than 5 minutes. There is one caveat that I was not happy about. Even though Norton says this product is compatible with Windows 10, it is NOT compatible with Microsoft Edge (replaced Internet Explorer). Norton will tell you that you must change your default browser in order to be protected while on the internet. Had I known this before buying, I would not have purchased this product as I like Microsoft's new browser and Windows 10. Never thought I had to confirm BOTH were compatible before purchasing.\n",

      "1\tAwful...that is the word that instantly comes to mind. For all the great things Amazon does, this is a complete failure. Can you store a ton of photos for free with Prime? Sure you can, so that's good. Unfortunately that is the last 'good' I can come up with. Uploading photos is PAINFULLY SLOW. Viewing photos once they are uploaded is unusable. It's so darn slow, you'll give up after a few minutes of viewing your images.  You can upload raw files, but creating thumbs for them takes HUGE chunks of time. Go to a page filled with Raw files and you'll wait 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes before even 100 of them have preview thumbs. Try to even look at one of your raw images takes 3-5 minutes to load!!  That is insane!!!    So let's get this straight...a photo management system that in no way let's your organize or manage photos, is slow as a dog, doesn't let you view photos any other way other than by date (yes you can create folders to upload into, but inexplicably, the viewer can't show you them by folder!!), can't seem to detect the dates on a raw file (it does for JPG's only), takes 5 seconds to open a JPG that's LESS THAN A MEG!, can't display a RAW file even though it tries and fails with absolutely no error messaging or indication that there's a problem...just a black screen, and it let's you share photos via email with someone, yet you can't even view them if they are in raw format. Even an 18MP JPG file takes 10-20 seconds to load.  Amazon, at least give us an option to pay money for some extra speed and features. How about any ability to sort??  View individual folders of photos.  This is basic stuff guys!  Sure it's a throw-in to Prime to get unlimited photo storage, but once they are up there, unless you have every single file named with something meaningful, you can't even tell which photos are which!! Simply put, this is the worst photo system I've ever see, free or paid. My Google Drive seems to have absolutely no issues at all with a 25MB Raw photo file. Thumb iscreated almost instantly and I can open it up in a split second. Get a clue Amazon!\n",

I use a simple Sony Handycam to shoot HD video and a TASCAM DR-05 digital sound recorder to record the sound separately.  It's a simple task to line up the video sound waveform with the Tascam sound waveform, so synchronization is a snap.<br /><br />There are also a multitude of effects that I haven't needed to look at.<br /><br />If you just want to make a few youtube videos that look a bit polished, then this software is just right for you, and an amazing value to boot.\n",

And it fixed all of the problems that 360 created.  Mail works.  Computer is less slow.  I have waited 2 weeks to review this, wondering if something would happen to how the computer runs.  Nothing.  All is good again.\n",

In the Bill Pay section you have to click enter twice or it will not take. In the register, you have to click the check number field to once to get the drop down arrow to appear to do anything.  After adding an attachment to a transaction, if you don't click enter button on the screen instead of pressing the enter key, the whole thing fails.  I could go on and on.  2013 had a solid interface and i regret upgrading.\n",

Quality was excellent after initial teething problem with sound and video non-alignment but this was sorted out after downloading an update from another site as recommended by  online support. Online support was also very good.<br />Other features yet to be tested out including saving it captured files in mobile devices format which will come in very useful; for example I am learning the tenor part of a piece of music and won't mind rehearsing in the head while commuting and this will surely make it easy as &#34;do re mi&#34;.. nit the learning bit but the  software use.

      "5\tThis is an amazing program, and it's free! I downloaded it because I was tired of paying through the nose for high-end software that really didn't do much more than Sweet Home. I used it to design an addition to our house. Very easy to learn and includes just about everything you need. The only thing I didn't like was the scalability of the program as far as printing out copies. I found it easier to print and later blow up an image of the design as I wanted. Other than that, there's an extensive collection of furniture and other items. You can resize everything to fit your stuff's exact dimensions. Fairly easy learning curve too which is nice. You want to produce and useable drawing, not spend hours learning how to move a line.\n",
      "3\tIf you think you might need to use a well-known CAD package in your future like AutoCAD or SolidWorks, I would recommend looking into those.  They have very steep learning curves and it is better to jump into them than to learn something different and have to un-learn what you know.<br /><br />I use this CAD package because it is much more compact than the big names.  It is also a fraction of the price.  I can draw lines, save them to a file, and print the drawings out so that the machine shop can fabricate my designs.  I mostly use the 2D capabilities of DesignCAD, manually creating views from various sides.  For my purposes, it does what I need.<br /><br />It can be a little glitchy when it comes to panning around your drawing.  Sometimes the screen just doesn't render correctly.  The &#34;Regenerate All&#34; command and I are best friends.  Memorize the shortcut keys or put it on a toolbar because you will need it.\n",

I tried to cancel. It informed the people who had mysteriously also been connected to the link. I went in and tried to set a new calendar entry for the meeting. It said the right day and time. I clicked ok. It reverted to a meeting at 11:30 p.m. and automatically sent this info out to a bunch of people whom I had not invited. (I got a lot of WTF replies and looked very unprofessional). The interface makes the old Outlook seem like a graceful gazelle. Clunky, hard to navigate, old outlook folders mysteriously disappeared, nonfunctional features. I am a long-time apple user, and I have to say that the ethos of Microsoft has NEVER WAVERED. It is run by, designed by, serviced by a bunch of engineers and robots without a single awareness of how humans actually work on computers. Their software is ALWAYS unintuitive, awkward, ugly. But this? This is even worse than usual, as it has finally reached the level of unusable. And my workplace didn't give me a choice. I'm thinking of forwarding the entire mailbox to gmail. (By the way, I used to run a computer network for an entire newspaper, and have a high level of knowledge and experience. I'm an expert-level user and teacher of Quark (yay!), Indesign (ugh, so bad) and photoshop.) And yet, whenever I have to add section breaks to a word document I end up curled up on the floor in the fetal position sobbing like a baby. And now my email, with which I correspond with the 150 students I'll teach and advise this semester, is UNUSABLE.\n",

I get weekly reports concerning successful backups BUT the software is located on a computer in Florida (I am in Ohio for the summer) in a home that has not only the computer turned off, but the electricity to the house as well, so a successful backup is not possible!  I tried to contact the manufacturer, but the e-mail was rejected because their mailbox was full, and I bet I know why!\n",

I was forced to upgrade from the 2012 Rental Property Manager to 2015 because Quicken stopped supporting it.<br /><br />I have had nothing but problems with this program from the time I installed it.  It began with half of the accounts in my password vault losing their passwords.  I spent a couple of hours on the phone (45 minutes on hold) and ended up having to de-activate each account and then link it to a new account just to make it work.<br /><br />I also lost the running balances on my main checking account.  Not helpful when paying bills.<br /><br />Now the cloud sync does not work.  I called Quicken and was told it is &#34;a known issue&#34; with no resolution in sight.<br /><br />The final straw is that Releases 7 and 8, which are presumably supposed to fix some of the many, many bugs this program has, crashes the entire program every time I try to download and install them.<br /><br />I am pretty ticked that Quicken would issue such a POS program, and even more annoyed that I was forced to pay them for the privilege.  These folks need to get their act together.\n",

I was unhappy to learn that there was only one more year for Norton 360 and it had been downgraded from the one I knew and trusted. Now for the product at hand. Do not install it unless you delete whatever Norton security that is on your computer or it will do it but it will lengthen your install by about an hour. The install itself is pretty straight forward. and I have installed it on four computers, one each of Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Saw no real difference in the installs and it works well on all. I can not comment directly on whether as some have said it takes less resources and your computer in turn runs faster. Mine does, but I made other changes at about the same time. Due to this I can not say whether it was totally Norton. Like all Norton products, it goes about its business and protects your computer. I have it set up to automatically scan the computer which I never did before and it seems to work ... Read more\n",

I'd have to eliminate them. Not a big deal, but a royal pain in the ass after awhile. The chapter selection icons had to be lined up by eye, and the size of the lettering would change when I'd reopen the application. I used it just to do menus, in that I didn't care for Final Cut Pro's, and read a review that Elements was a good choice to use with it for menus. It also seemed to lighten up my video, and when I would darken it in Elements and then burn a dvd, it didn't seem to make any difference from one to the other. Didn't use it for the whole editing/production thing, so I have no opinion on that. I may try it, though, because FCP had its warts, too. I used a Pinnacle Liquid Edition 6 for nearly 10 yrs on a pc that, in my opinion, blows either one of them away.\n",

      "3\tQuicken is a nightmare. Things are laid out very poorly and make it very hard to start using the program. Once you get the hang of it, it's a little nicer. Maybe it's my fault for not spending a ton of time with it, but you'd think it'd be at least a little easier to use. Quicken also has quite a few quirks.. Such as not being able to categorize business income/expenses without a tax line. Not all of us want to go and buy TurboTax! Several times now I've had to reset my Quicken Cloud account to get it to sync with my phone. It just adds an obnoxious step to something that should be behind the scenes. Unlike the rest of the program, I can give Intuit credit for the app. Once you're done with the adventure of trying to get it to sync properly, the app is nice. It actually provides more reports than the desktop app, and is much less buggy. Overall, is it worth it? I can't really say.\n",

I don't think it is as pretty or as easy to use as my old Microsoft Money 2006, but after a few days of trial and error, I've figured out the little quirks and have become pretty comfortable using it.<br /><br />You do have to create a Quicken (Intuit) account log in when you first run it or log in to your existing Intuit account. I don't use online services or link to a phone or tablet app, so I can't say anything about how well it syncs with them. I'm strictly an offline user and enter all of my info manually.

H&R Block's tax software did just this very easily and without a steep learning curve for a new user like me.

When I updated Windows, KIS displayed a message saying it protects you in the Windows 10 operating system.  Later I tried the KIS Safe Money feature that isolates your browser when you are at financial web sites.  I was disappointed to find that it did not activate in the Windows 10 browser, Microsoft Edge.  I discovered that Safe Money still works in my old Internet Explorer browser.  From a web site in Edge, it's easy to switch to the same site in the old browser, just two clicks.  KIS customer service told me they are working on an update.\n",
      "2\tThis is so ironic, it's almost funny.  After 3+ months of trying to resolve an issue with Amazon's cloud service, I see they are now promoting yet another desktop app to save all your precious pics using their cloud service.  BEWARE.  I'm a big fan of Amazon, and maybe I'm an outlier on the continuum of customer satisfaction, but this spring, they LOST ALL MY PICTURES and could not recover them.  I won't say don't use them, but I'd never use them exclusively for file back ups, regardless of what you want to save.  Physical drives, alternative cloud service, whatever, I'd think about redundancy beyond Amazon cloud service for whatever you want or need to save/archive.  BTW, they deleted a treasure trove of photos taken on our trip to Europe.  They were taken with my SLR, downloaded to iPad while traveling for daily FB updates, and subsequently uploaded to Amazon cloud (via Amazon Photo App).  I assumed they were safe in the cloud, so deleted them off my iPad after they were uploaded.  Mistake.<br /><br />In short, be careful if your digital content matters to you.\n",

      "3\tI read the reviews here and thought I might offer a bit of balance. I transcode video from my digital cameras all the time... and over the years, as I've changed cameras, I've had several different video formats. The one that was the biggest problem was an old Kodak I owned in 2004. It shot video but at 12.9 frames per second... and I could not both merge these small files, resize, AND up the framerate to 25 or 30 fps. This program lets me do this.<br /><br />I only use h264 to encode... so I can't speak for any of the other codecs... and this program does have all the advanced settings... but it documentation is terrible and unlike some very capable free programs I've used like AVI4PSP, AVIDEMUX, and Handbrake... you can't run a cursor over a setting and get some guidance to learn what it does and many of these settings give you no preset values to choose from. That's just crazy.<br /><br />As for the person who got worst results than what they put in... I can only guess they don't know what their doing... and picked a bitrate way too low for good results. It's always best to do at least a 2pass encode with a adequate bitrate for the format. So for standard 640x480 30fps I use 1800-2000kbs. That's still way lower than the 9000kbs my camera shoots at.. but then it uses an very inefficient format.<br /><br />That being said... it's not worth $49. It doesn't even give that as the regular price at their site. There it's $29.\n",

      "1\tI have purchased a version of Norton every year for over 16 years for its virus scanning capabilities.  Norton 360 was a piece of junk, but still provided virus protection in spite of being an absolute CPU hog.  I've been using Norton Internet Security the past few years in spite of it not giving me as much control as I'd like.  But none of them were as bad as this version of Norton Security.  It nagged me EVERY DAY because I chose not to install its toolbar in Chrome - in spite of checking the option (every day!) to never remind me again.  I finally gave in and installed it.  Then I promptly disabled it because I just don't like 3rd party toolbars in my browsers.  Guess what?  Now the stupid software is nagging me again because the toolbar is disabled!  Argggggghhhhhhh!!!  Enough already!  Norton Security has become the MALWARE that it's supposed to protect me against!<br /><br />Unless this major bug gets fixed soon, I will NOT be purchasing another Norton product.

      "1\ti'm updating a prior review.<br /><br />Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.<br /><br />What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.<br /><br />Don't use this product.<br /><br />--------<br />The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)<br /><br />I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.<br /><br />So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.<br /><br />I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.<br /><br />It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.<br /><br />There's no Help file.<br /><br />On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.<br /><br />I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars.\n",
      "1\tHorrible, horrible interface!  Unless you like light gray on lighter gray and white.  Microsoft says it is a design choice (MS' choice, not the customer)<br /><br />Buy a previous version of VISIO and MS Office if you can.  DO NOT UPGRADE to Visio 2013 - You WILL be sorry.<br /><br />I upgraded from VISIO 2010 at our company.  Tried using it for about an hour.  I am a power user of the graphics portion of VISO with highly customized Ribbon and quick task bar.  While the customizations were recognized by VISO 2013 after the upgrade, the customizations and icons were almost unrecognizable and unreadable!  Windows 8 and 10 vomit bright and garish primary colors all over the screen.  Yet the new 2013 interface is a sea of gray and white.  There is very little color (other than shades of gray) and no depth to the icons or buttons. Only three schemes are available.  Light Gray, Gray, and Dark Gray (I am not kidding, those are the only options)  The dark gray is not close to having sufficient contrast.  I have been using VISIO since 1998 or 1999 and every version up to and including 2007 was an improvement.  VISIO 2010 and its ribbon (and removal of functionality) was a downgrade from VISIO 2007.  In contrast with VISIO 2013, VISIO 2010 is a vastly superior version.(2013 is an extreme DOWNGRADE from 2010)<br /><br />When I went looking for additional skins or themes, every forum overwhelmingly had complaints about this ugly and unreadable theme (and no, you cannot change it).  On the Microsoft site, there were also a huge number of complaints.  Microsoft's answer was &#34;The Theme is this way by design&#34;<br /><br />Microsoft, still appears to have failed to learned by the recent debacles of the XBONE (MS had to back off of several early stances and design choices which have greatly reduced sales numbers ) and Windows 8 (Vast numbers told MS they hated the interface long before it was released)Instead of telling customers the software look is &#34;By Design&#34; MS should paying more attention to what customers are saying (and fire the art school dropout's who came up with this mess of a user interface without decent choice of themes).<br /><br />I had the IT department uninstall 2013 and reinstall VISO 2010.  I simply could not comfortably use VISIO 2013.<br /><br />We have a home use program at work that allows us to purchase and use Office 2013 and Visio 2013 at home for a very small cost.  Even at nearly free, I refuse to purchase and use a product that is a vast and flat wasteland of white and gray.<br /><br />It may be a Microsoft design choice.  MY CHOICE as a customer is NOT TO BUY for home or USE Office 2013 or Visio 2013 at the office.\n",

      "4\tA few days ago I decided to upgrade to Cook’n 11 from Version 10.  (I have been using Cook’n since version 8 which I bought in 2011).  Something went wrong during the conversion and as a result I could not open Version 11.  I contacted the DVO support group and they have been very prompt in their replies and suggestions.  I still had versions 9 and 10 on my computer at the time I installed Version 11.  My problems have all been worked out now and because I had previously exported my various cookbooks I was able to import them into Version 11 with a new install. I didn’t lose much at all just a few new recipes in my personal cookbook that can be put back in.  Last night I started playing with Version 11 and I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I thought Version 10 was good but Version 11 totally blows it away.  Using the new Snip-It Import Tool I have been able to get recipes I had saved in Evernote into Cook’n and using my scanner I was able to add back the printed copies I had of the few that I lost during the initial install.  Tonight I pulled out some old recipes my Mom had clipped out of various newspapers.  Some are dated 1986 and 1987 and the pages have somewhat yellowed with age.  I scanned these into my computer and then used the Snip-It tool and was able to get the recipes into Cook’n with just minor cleanup where creases or age of the paper interfered slightly with the OCR software.  It beats the heck out of typing all this stuff in.  There are three ways to use Snip-It; using a scanner, clipping from a web page or using clipboard.  I have used all three methods.  I LOVE VERSION 11.  (The Capture tool is also still in Version 11) This is in my opinion the best Cook Book software out there and besides being so convenient this new version is so MUCH FUN. I have used Google image search to find pictures for some of the recipes that I originally printed but that when scanned didn't bring in the picture.  Like I said earlier in this review, I have used4 versions now and whenever I have had a problem the DVO support team has done their best to help me sort it out.  I am very happy with the support from the DVO team and with the new Version 11.  I rate the software and support 5 out of 5 STARS.  Nina Irwin  UPDATE: ; ;8/26/2015 I have had a problem syncing new recipes from my PC to the Cook'n Cloud.  Technical Team has deleted my Cloud Account 5 or 6 times now and I have had to delete &#34;Workspace&#34; and then restore my backup, then re-create my Cloud Account and then I can sync one time from PC to the new setup Cloud Account.  After that, if I am very lucky I am able to sync changes one time from the PC to the Cloud before getting the &#34;something unexpected happened and expected data cannot be found...&#34; message pops up and I am unable to sync.  Everything else in the program works fine but I wanted to be able to sync recipes to my Kindle so I could use the Kindle in the kitchen instead of printing every recipe.  Unfortunately I was only able to accomplish this one time.  It's not on the Kindle side it's a problem syncing from my PC to my Cloud Account.  I have been unable to sync now since 8/22/2015 and have not had a reply from DVO on the latest problem.  I still love the overall Cook'n but am very frustrated with the inability to Sync to the cloud.  So I have had to drop my stars from 5 to 4.\n",

      "1\tprogram has too many problems, causes too many errors on my computer and continuously makes my computer crash. does not work as a good program. I'm sure I would like the program if I could use it but I cannot as each time I open the program it almost immediately makes my computer crash.

      "5\tI've had this program for many years and have seen it &#34;grow&#34; through a lot of upgrades. I enjoy the different cookbooks I've downloaded and being able to get internet recipes added to program. I love having my own cookbook to add my own recipes and be able to easily email them to friends. It's nice too having the nutrition information available. I love having the app on my ipad/iphone so that I don't have to print out the recipe from my PC and take it to the kitchen or grocery store. The mobile apps sync with the PC so I'm always up to date. ON occasion when there is a problem with some part not working as usual, DVO support works to solve the issue. Recently when my Cookn on the PC would not email a recipe, I sent an email requesting help. After trying to explain what my settings were, the Technician suggested that I make a picture of that screen and send it to her. Issue was solved right away! I also enjoy the Newsletter!\n",

      "4\tUsed for several weeks now, still learning my way around. Purchased to replace Aperture which Apple will soon be orphaning and replacing with the &#34;Mickey Mouse&#34; (sorry, Mickey) app &#34;Photos.&#34; Organizing images in Lightroom is unnecessarily complicated, but the editing functions work well, and, on my iMac at least, at reasonable speeds. Probably will forget Aperture and my annoyance within a few weeks, and it looks like Lightroom will take it's place quite adequately. Who knows, it may prove to be much better than Aperture.

      "5\tI actually bought this software a several years ago and when I initially downloaded it I thought, “It`s okay,” but since then I have come to really like it.  It is simple and easy to use with a clean interface.  It loads very quickly, you can type anything you want for each entry and the calculator lets you balance each check register at your leisure. I use it to track 9 different accounts.  In the version that I have you can track up to 10 accounts. In addition to using it as check register, I also use it to reconcile my credit card purchases, as well as for other finances.  I now find this simple and easy to use product to be indispensable, and the customer service support is absolutely fantastic.  I recently bought a new computer and although I easily copied the software from the old computer to the new one, I couldn`t figure out how to transfer the many years of historical entries in the check registers to the new computer.  A customer service representative walked me through it, step by step.  The customer service representative was super responsive, extremely courteous, highly knowledgeable and very, very patient.  I rate this 5 stars overall, although I only give the software 4 stars because in the version that I have you cannot copy and paste, but the developers get and extra star for outstanding customer support.  I am most definitely a fan.\n",

      "5\tHourGuard is reasonably priced and you don't have to buy it every year. I have been using it for several years and I believe I had to buy a newer version when I got Windows 7, but I now have Windows 10 and I haven't had to update. I need to account for my time while working for each client and this is a simple, user friendly, program that does just that. It works my time out to the minute - and since I don't do math - it does that for me as well. I can also invoice for whatever time period I choose.<br />1 Drawback - save the original downloaded installer because if your computer crashes a couple of years later, you will need it. It happened to me and I went to the site and downloaded the program again, but it said my password info didn't work with this newer version. I had to find the most recent installer that I saved when I initially bought it. I did try other time tracking software, but I wont waste my time trying others again.<br />Also, I didn't pay for extra support, but when I did have a question, they ALWAYS got back to me within a couple of days.<br />-----  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  -----<br />p.s.

YOU MUST GET OUT YOUR WALLET AND UPGRADE TO 2015&#34;. Wow. I don't recall being warned, but OK.<br /><br />So I upgraded -- silly me. Persistently 2015 wouldn't install at all, or I continued to get the message &#34;you must upgrade to 2015&#34; even though I was running 2015. This after almost 2 hours with tech support at Intuit. They said &#34;installs with all software frequently have problems.&#34; Really? Not my experience with 90% of the rest of software-land. With REAL software companies, that is.<br /><br />For my purposes it is sufficient to download a CSV of my banking transactions and categorize them. That's my plan going forward -- considerably less hassle than trying to make their software work (again and again and again).\n",

      "5\tI've been a long time user of PCMover...The latest version of PCMover Professional (Contact Laplink.com for latest version) will help you migrate your files and APPLICATIONS to your new Windows 10 PC. Many times when upgrading to a new version of Windows the Windows Upgrade will fail and the only way to do an upgrade of Windows is with a clean install...The problem is with a clean install you are left with your new operating system but none of your old Applications or files will be available. PCMover Professional (Latest Version for Windows 10) will help you transfer all those applications and files on your old PC to your new PC (Or on your upgraded PC). There are at least 3 methods to doing this...Either an in place upgrade from your Windows.old folder from your upgraded PC. A PC to PC transfer method via USB or Crossover ethernet (or network) and lastly via an external hard drive. To accomplish this you run the PCMover software on both your OLD and NEW computers following the instructions. It will then begin the process depending on which method you have chosen. At the end you will have your files and Applications on your new computer. I have used PCMover to migrate applications and files from XP to Vista, Vista to Windows 7 and now from WIndows 7 to Windows 10 (Because Windows 10 would not migrate my applications on at least one of my computers). If you are like me and have a LOT of applications installed PCMover Professional will literally save you a week's time of installing all your applications and files over again. It is well worth the price. Sometimes some applications cannot be moved or do not move properly but I would say 80 to 90 percent get moved and are working after the process and the rest you can do yourself. Highly recommended.\n",

      "1\tThe upgrade install crapped out on my daughter's laptop before it even got started. It said something needs my attention, click that, and it reboots, only to say something needs my attention (but not what) again. On my gaming PC it stalled at 32% installed, forcing me to hit the reset button. Luckily it was able to revert to Windows 7 and the computer works fine.<br /><br />Those failures to install were the BEST experiences I had with the Windows 10 upgrade.<br /><br />On my living room computer Windows 10 installed perfectly (well, after having to delete all the installation files it had downloaded and forcing the update again from the command prompt due to multiple update failures). And that's where the trouble began. It looked like everything was going well, then I discovered I had no sound at all. Keep in mind this is the computer that I use for multimedia in the living room, connected to my big screen and surround sound. Without sound, it's pointless. I updated my sound card driver to the latest version (even though Windows 10 compatibility isn't expected until October) and got sound back! Yay!<br /><br />Then the internet conked out completely. The network was fine. I was even able to stream a movie from this computer to my gaming computer downstairs with no trouble, and every other PC and device in the house could get to the internet without a hitch, but Win10 kept saying that there was a problem with the broadband modem's ability to connect to the ISP. I tried some Microsoft fixes via their support forums (even getting it to say there was an internet connection - for about 15 seconds) and finally gave up. I decided to revert back to Win7.<br /><br />I started Windows 10's built-in rollback feature and the computer went into an endless reboot-&#34;Restoring Previous Version Of Windows&#34;-reboot cycle. After about three hours and countless reboots I figured out it wasn't working. I ended up having to reinstall Win7 from scratch - losing all settings and installed programs (unfortunately I'm also lazy and careless and have lost some activation codes and keys - including for MS Office 2013 - which means unless I can find them eventually, I'm going to have to buy them all over again). If I had planned on installing Win7 fresh I could have used a keygrabber and retrieved some of those keys and activation codes prior to reinstalling.<br /><br />Thanks to the Windows 10 upgrade I'm not only back to Windows 7, but I'm WORSE OFF than I was before.<br /><br />I also upgraded my mom's PC and now her printer doesn't work. This is not because the drivers aren't working - Win10 reports the printer is installed and working fine. No, the Windows Print Spooler service is broken and I can find no fix for it online. Also, the Windows 10-compatible version of Kaspersky won't run anything but Safe Mode on her PC. It says a reboot is required to fix the problem. So you reboot. Then it fails again and says - yep, you guessed it - a reboot is required to fix the problem.<br /><br />And I just got word from my stepson that he had to reintsall Windows 7 from scratch after Win10 broke his PC, too. I don't have the details, but at this point do you need any more to convince you to stay away until MS gets it right?<br /><br />Early adopter, beware. [smh]\n",

For several months at the end of 2014, it said that an &#34;update was available,&#34; but I could never download the update because it claimed that some program was active and it could not complete the update. I called G Data service and received instructions of how to fix this problem. The instructions seemed quite complicated but I was eventually able to fix it.

On DELL the F12 key allows you to select the flash drive<br />--Use your $$$ KEY (ouch) when requested (this is one spot that gave me problems before)<br />--Select the options to install clean (save nothing) but it did save all under &#34;c:\\windows.old&#34; like past windows upgrades,<br />--Install takes over for just over an hour and no errors<br /><br />Yes, I know the upgrade is free --<br />Let's talk about that for a minute.  I spent well over 30+ hours trying to install using the MediaCreationx64 tool.  I combed through hundreds of posts relating to &#34;Something Happened -- Windows 10 failed to install&#34; error I kept getting.  Believe me, I did almost everything and no joy.  Went to Microsoft support on-line and that was a futil experience. I just figured I spent enough time fooling around to install a free OS (after 30 hours it's no longer free).  To me, the money was well spent!<br /><br />I've upgraded the same DELL (2009 i7) hardware 3 times: Vista Pro, Windows 7 Pro and now Windows 10 Pro.\n",

It was sporadic, occasionally functions stopped working and I could find no Windows Financial Management system that gave me what I needed.<br /><br />The other day I was trying to update my accounts and I couldn't save my work to a local disk.  While searching Amazon for an alternative program, I discovered Quicken Deluxe 2015 Download (vs. a disk) for less that $40, so thought I really had nothing to lose.<br /><br />The download was immediate (we have 60 megabit internet here) and my existing Quicken files were loaded into Quicken 2015.

I was not looking for online support or a complicated program, just something simple to keep track of expenses like Money has done for a number of years.

However, this product fills the need for those looking for a replacement for Money.  I cannot address the effectiveness of online sync to bank accounts as I am not interested in this.\n",

The operating system was hours hold, clean with Norton AV installed. I had planned to use it to plan out a basement remodel.  After playing with it for a few mins I closed out of it.  The program immediately sent up pop up telling me that it could clean my system or optimize it. (It has been a few days, I forget the exact message.)  The pop up was branded with the same name as this software.<br /><br />It seems the this business model here is to get you to download this free software just try to get you to pay for something else.  At a minimum this is annoying, at worst it is malware.  Since it didn't want it on my system and wasn't aware that the software publishers had bundled it in with the software I was wanting, I classify it as malware.  This is deceptive business practice and I'm surprised Amazon would be party to distributing it.  Amazon generally has a good brand, it seems a bit tarnishing to associate with this kind of business practice.\n",

      "5\tMy hobby is collecting movies on disc.  Since I already pay for these movies, either by renting them online or by paying for video streaming, I have the right (called right of use) to copy these movies to disc for my own personal collection.  Since copy protection was put in place it has been a real challenge to find a way to copy movies to disc since all disc recorders are now programmed not to write movies to disc if they are copy protected.  I've tried using devices that strip the copy protection out (like Grex Dimax).  The problem with that is the best quality I could get was 480i since I had to use S Video cables to do this.  In addition, regardless of what the sellers of these types of devices say, it does degrade the quality of the picture and you can really see it on a 52&#34; HD TV.  Then I found Audials Moviebox. I downloaded the trial version which is extremely limited in functionality, but there's enough functionality to validate whether the product really works.  Although the trial version says that it will record for only 10 minutes, my experience was that it would record for only 2 minutes.  But that was enough to create a video and play it on my blu ray player and look at it on my 52&#34; HD TV.  OMG, the quality is incredible.  It records in 720p (and there are levels of quality you can select based on size (the number of GB), but when I play it on an upconverter (like a blu ray player), it looks like 1080i.  I AM THRILLED.  The only drawback is: I think the help documentation within the software could be better and the software is not intuitive. I'm in technology and design applications and our philosophy is that a user should be able to use an application without any help at all.  Moviebox is far from that, but after a couple of hours I got it, and once you get it, it's a piece of cake.  Copying a 3 or 4 hour movie would be a challenge if using RW discs since they have capacity for only 4.7 GB.  But in that case I think I would make it a 2 disc movie, so there is a workaround.  You stream the movie on your computer and hit record in Moviebox, so you must have a computer that has enough memory and processor speed to handle this software otherwise it will hang. The specs are on the Audials web site.  I would highly recommend this software.\n",

      "2\tI have been struggling with this software for several years going back several versions.  It will record the video but will often times crash.  On average everything I record either has to be recorded 2 or 3 times before I am successful, or I have to break the video down into 30 minute segments then join them together.  Even that is painful, as the program will crash while loading or freeze during processing, or give me a black screen as the final output.  That too will take several attempts.  I know they have a newer version but I am hesitant to keep throwing money at software that just doesn't seem to be working for me.  I do have a newer High end computer specifically for video editing at the home level so I don't think it is my computer.  No other programs give me any problems.  Customer support seems helpful, but the usual answer is to uninstall and reinstall the whole program.  I am looking for something better.\n",
      "1\tDO NOT UPGRADE if you care about your brand.<br /><br />First, if you use any previous version of quickbooks and you upgrade to Windows 10,  Intuit forces you to buy QB 2015.  We had 2014 which is almost unchanged hence a waste of money to upgrade. So we bought it, which I can accept. It turns out some genius in the marketing department decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; email invoicing to use an Intuit branded HTML email that you cannot alter or turn off. It has a huge dollar amount at the top which screams we're a desperate small company, and a new lovely branded &#34;Powered by Quickbooks&#34; with multiple links to Intuit in them whether you like it or not. So at this point, you can't go back to 2014, because they didn't patch a simple dll file so it would run on win 10 to intentionally push sales, or modify the email template.<br /><br />It's a company run by marketers these days and the product has gone years without real meaningful changes, the software sucks but they have the most support so the POS will survive until people/accountants wake up and demand more. Considering freshbooks now.\n",

They were up front about that and I knew it during the purchase.<br /><br />However the program checks for updates automatically and anytime there is a new version WITHOUT WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LICENSED COPY.  Yes that is right, if you forget and click to apply the update it will download and install and without warning wipe out your licensed version and put you back in a 14 day trial.  You have to go and PAY FOR IT AGAIN!!!<br /><br />This is equivalent to ransom ware.  (charging you money to get your files back)  Terrible practice.<br /><br />If this happens to anyone check your trash folder on your mac.  The old copy is there and thankfully you can get it back.  (no warning about that in the update installer either!)  Just delete the &#34;trial&#34; version they sneakily put in it's place and copy your old version back to your applications folder.<br /><br />Other than that the program works.  I'll give it three stars just because it runs the one program I need it to (QuickLoad reloading software).  Just be careful and TURN OFF checking for updates if you don't need them.  If the program you want to run under CrossOver works, there really isn't any need for updates.\n",

A pretty good feat considering that Windows 7 is six years old now.  Also it boots quickly, and does not have that bloated feel that older versions of Windows did.<br /><br />The interface is very clean and intuitive, but they also do not hide the power features too far away.  Against all odds, they have actually made the app store useful.<br /><br />With this download product, all I had to do was download the ISO and burn it to a DVD.  Then I copied in the serial number once during installation, and everything went smoothly.  I expected problems but did not have any.<br /><br />Microsoft wants to collect some usage statistics from Windows 10.  I was concerned that this would be hidden somehow, but actually during installation they came right out and said it (watch for the &#34;Express Options&#34; button, don't click that, and instead just click customize and all the options are there).

      "1\tWhere to start...no pun intended. I had hope for Windows 10 after hearing people say &#34;it's just like windows 7 it's awesome&#34; my hope was quickly destroyed as soon as I clicked on the &#34;amazing&#34; new start button. You basically have the ugly, useless tile screen from windows 8 put into a box on your desktop, not a true start menu.  The start menu is made up of stupid, useless, ugly tile start screen apps, all apps list and if you scroll all the way to the bottom of the list you will find programs and accessories which is the only thing that should be there in the first place.<br /><br />Microsoft needs to give up on the stupid useless, app garbage on desktops. The search bar next to the &#34;start menu&#34; is laggy and brings up web search results etc. even if you simply search for a file on your pc, the relocation of simple features/settings is dumb and hiding things behind app style Windows 8 junk is not cool.<br /><br />Cortana sucks, again the search is laggy and to even use it you need to basically let the program monitor your every move and keystroke. Microsoft used to pride itself on respecting users privacy calling out data miners like google but as you may have guessed by reading the revised versions of their user agreement they sent out prior to releasing Windows 10 that is no longer the case. Windows 10 will track your every move or click, apps can read every message or conversation and data mine your entire PC in every nook and cranny including personal files on your hard drive.  If you don’t believe it check out the settings on any program you open and see for yourself. You will now see notifications, news stories and ads on your lock screen (what is this a damn phone) and every time you launch the new edge browser you will get MSN top stories/ads. There are literally a hundred options you need to turn off to not have your every click tracked and sent to Microsoft and advertisers...even if you turn them off they are still on in another menu somewhere else, do you understand why it's free...more like freemium.<br /><br />The new edge browser simply sucks compared to any other browsers out there including internet explorer. When you launch edge it gives you an infinite scrolling screen of MSN news and ads that you cannot turn off, at least I cannot find a way to do it, with a search bar saying &#34;where to next&#34; where you can do a web search with bing. I wanted to change my web search to Yahoo but it required going to yahoo.com then opening then new edge menu bar, and adding it then setting it to default, users on windows 7/8 will have trouble with this as it can be very tricky to find. I didn't find many positives with edge, it loads up decently but what’s the use when you have an a fraction of the options and customizations you have with any other browser and the fact that Edge doesn’t support a lot of websites hence why Windows 10 still has Internet Explorer tucked away. I can draw on the web page I’m looking at....whoopee, it's the app version of internet explorer on Windows 8 with Microsoft paint integration.<br /><br />The OS feels more like a phone than ever before.  If you boot up windows 8.1 then took a windows phone and laid it on the bottom left corner of the pc monitor screen you have Windows 10. It almost runs like an advertising tool for Microsoft to sell you useless crap via tiles and notifications popping up. I tried playing my games that I was running fine on Windows 8.1/7 and there are many issues and graphics issues. Some games like Borderlands/Borderlands 2 have major graphic issues now where bushes and bullets look like paint blotches splattered on the screen no matter how much you play with the video options. Dead Island, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Light will not work at all, they simply crash when launched so I’m wondering if my ATI Radeon card is having windows 10 update issues as they worked on 8.1.  WOW just stopped working as well, battle.net app freezes and looses track of where the files are stored on my PC, but now works fine since I deleted this Microsoft spyware off my PC and went back to 8.1.<br /><br />Windows 10 update will override the drivers installed by your graphics card suite causing crashes, graphical problems and infinite restarts if the driver you have installed is not the one big brother has in their auto update. Again I had hopes that Microsoft would actually deliver a quality product like Windows 7 but instead we get a lazy freemium version of windows 8.1 that rivals google it terms of disgusting spying/data stealing for profit. Windows 10 is &#34;freemium&#34; not free, you pay for it by giving up every ounce of privacy for Microsoft’s financial benefit.  They baseically turn your PC into a Microsoft server, your PC can also be used to upload updates to other pc users/owners like a hotspot.<br /><br />I’m glad that I switched to OSX again a few months back and only use windows on my secondary computer, I won’t be putting this garbage on my mac. If you do upgrade the first thing you should do is go into every settings menu you can find and check the privacy options, you will still be data mined just not as badly. You will have to do this more than once as there are for example two control panels....named the same but both with their own privacy settings.  The split personality of Windows 8 is back in full effect . In short Windows 10 is just Windows 8.1 freemium edition, you even still have to right click the start menu to get control panel (one of them) and stuff quickly because if you traditionally left click on it, it wil just shows you apps and useless tile garbage, basically the Windows 8 start screen in a box instead of desktop features and shortcuts to things you actually need.<br /><br />Windows 10 is a total failure, the people claiming it to be Windows Christ are simply dreaming or paid to say so, stick to windows 7/8.1. Windows 10 is nothing like Windows 7, try it first on an old computer if you are curious. If you hate Windows 8, Windows 10 will not improve anything, you will still be using the same failed phone/pc hybrid operating system but you will have to give up ALL your privacy for nothing you can't do on windows 7/8.1. Apparently you will also be paying for games like solitaire (1.49 a month) and 14.99 for a dvd/blue ray play back software.

It is awful in every regard, UNLESS your only planned use is as an electronic checkbook register.  I finally went with Quicken 2015 Deluxe for Windows using Parallels. I haven't had a moment's difficulty, save some very minor downloading issues with my credit union. (This has occurred in prior versions too. Not sure it's Quicken's fault.) Software you'll need is (1) Windows $120.00. I use Windows 8; I think Windows 7 is ok too. (2) Parallels $80.00. (3) Quicken Deluxe 2015. I had no trouble getting up and running, and it works like a charm on my MacBook Pro. I have the latest version of OSX but had all of this installed while I had the OSX version just prior to the current one.  If you asked me to rate that combination and setup, I'd give it five stars.  Save yourself some grief. DO NOT BUY Quicken for Mac.\n",

It's a starter kit bundled with pre-made templates in the program. You can make a custom layout using bits and pieces to accommodate the look of your website with the varied features in it, but some you need to upgrade to Website X5 Evolution to use which also provides you with access to a server to upload everything and have it running which Compact 11 is missing. I kind of do miss the coding since that's started how I started in the beginning on Adobe Dreamweaver with html, css, and php making sitea on Drupal and Wordpress just since Adobe changed their approach to their programs I used this as an alternative. With more practice, tinkering, and a bit more money going towards upgrading to a more superior version for the extra bits and pieces for your stuff to function properly it can really work well. Just go into further investigating the programs and what they provide before you buy it and get screwed over causing you to buy something else that has only one extra feature that the one you bought from the beginning should of had from the start.\n",

Not only is this a crippled product but it also constitutes a security risk!  Why?<br />1.)  The program attempts to connect and transmit data to the Intuit serves on multiple occassions.  Why does it need to do this?  Updating the CD software once, makes the software UNUSABLE without an internet connection constantly on.<br />2.)  The program will not let you print without connecting to the servers either.  So, basically, after doing my taxes, I was forced to either give Intuit access to my data or redo by hand.  Needless to say I re-did everything by hand.<br /><br />Finally the product is completely crippled without an internet connection.  Because there is no mention of this on the packaging, I will contact the attorney general in the state of Illinois.  This is false representation.  This product is simply a rip-off, if you need to work offline!  Further, it gives you no provision to protect your data by forcing you to constantly let it talk to the Intuit servers!\n",

      "5\tI know there have been foul reviews of this program (the downloaded version as well as the disc version), but I downloaded and installed it last night, worked with it for two hours this morning, and it's performing beautifully. I thought I'd be shackled to saving documents in RTF through the simple text editor provided with the program, but was pleasantly surprised to find Version 13 works with Microsoft Word 2007, regardless the software requirements for version 13 specify it works with a much later version.<br /><br />I was previously using IBM's Via Voice on a Windows XP netbook and needed something that works on my HP laptop running 8.1 (which was targeted for use by a college student, so it hasn't a great lot of RAM or the best processor). I was wary after reading the multiple negative reviews, but decided to take the risk (regardless Amazon will not give you a refund on software downloads if the program won't work for you; so buyer beware).<br /><br />I did have to download the package twice. The first time, certain .dll files didn't unpack correctly and Amazon's installation told me to download a fresh package. It took two hours each time (on broadband) for the download to complete, but it's a huge program, so deal with it. The second time, it installed and registered itself without a hitch. I'm not ecstatic about having to &#34;open an account&#34; with Nuance in order to register the software, but that's Nuance's marketing issue, not Amazon's.<br /><br />To make this software work correctly, you DO have to BE PATIENT, take your time, and give the app decent samples of your voice over time. One time is not enough, but the initial reading is dictated by the program; subsequent &#34;readings&#34; come from the documents you dictates. The initial reading choice ranges from &#34;Charlie & and the Chocolate Factory&#34; to Arthur Clarke's &#34;3001: A Space...whatever it is&#34;.<br /><br />You DO have to SLOW DOWN, BE PATIENT, and help the program interpret yourvoice the first few times you use the software. So if you're expecting to be able to dictate *Doctor Zhivago* first thing out of the box, you'll want to table that plan for a couple of days.<br /><br />You DO have to let it analyze additional dictation samples and train the program so it will work faster and better for you. Do try to remember that it knows how to work with myriad international accents, so it's got a few things to work out regarding how you speak -- which isn't like anyone else on the planet, so hey! you're looking at an invention that would be considered magic a couple hundred years ago. BE PATIENT and maybe a little grateful, and it will work better for you the longer you use it.<br /><br />I didn't find the correction feature cumbersome at all -- IF you take the time to download the &#34;Cheatsheet&#34; list of voice commands from Nuance (just google for &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 Cheatsheet&#34; and you'll be led to the PDF for download), and IF you take the time to download and look at &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking Workbook&#34; and the user guide (again google for them). The program works a lot faster and better if you use the voice commands. On the other hand, if you're impatient and don't wanna learn the commands...if you're determined to edit by highlighting and retyping text, well then, prepare to be frustrated.<br /><br />The more you use your voice, the more this Dragon becomes your personal friend.<br /><br />Be warned that the first hour or so of dictation, Dragon will...be...slow to type what you say. It will lag severely. This is because it's learning about you. BE PATIENT and use the &#34;Acoustic and Language Model Optimizer&#34; (see the User Guide or poke around in the &#34;Audio&#34; menu) after you dictate each sizable document, and (again) BE PATIENT enough to give Dragon the 20 or 60 minutes it needs to build a profile of how you speak so it can serve you better. (Yes, you have to do this repeatedly. Did you expect yourchild to walk the first time he or she managed to stand up?) You can schedule the Optimizer to do its analysis at 3 a.m. if you're impatient and don't want to wait around for it to finish.<br /><br />I'm using Dragon to dictate notes containing a lot of specific 15th-century terms including quotes from Parliamentary acts (in archaic-to-modern middle English) and weird city/town names. Behold! it already knows the names of people from the MIddle Ages (which surprised me), and it even knew how to spell 'oubliette,' which I wasn't expecting. (How many people use that word, after all?) It may have problems with Latin terms, but it's willing to learn. Once the word or phrase is entered and you take the time to record yourself saying it, the learning sticks. If you don't take the time to record the phrase, then don't whinge when Dragon doesn't recognize the phrase.<br /><br />Yes, you'll have to go hunting for the workbook, the user guide, and the cheatsheet of commands that Nuance provides if you want to use Dragon well. But hey, you were brave enough to download the program without a guide. Now go forth and find the guides you need to use the program and help it work with you.<br /><br />If you do, you'll find out it's an excellent writing partner. If you don't...then you might want to consider going back to the archaic dictation machine and a human assistant to type it all out for you. Or find someone who takes shorthand who will translate it to that even more ancient medium...paper.\n",

Aside from some updated graphics, I can't see any difference from the 6-year-old version I'd had.  In fact, I've been prompted twice for upgrades only to find that the program couldn't connect to the 'server'  and 'to try again later' ... or something like that.  That doesn't give you a very positive impression when you have a brand new product.\n",

If you want to renew a license directly from webroot, you can pay $80 and take the easy path, if you want to buy from Amazon, it is only $40 but you lose any days left on your old license and need to contact customer support to switch to the new license.  The initial purchase and install was easy, but the renewal is a complete pain.  I've already paid for the renewal, but if this process is the same cumbersome thing next year, I'm going to switch to another product.  Wouldn't a company want to incentivize customers to return?\n",

But the Amazon rep was extremely knowledgeable and patient.  It took a while, but we got the job done and now Quicken is installed working properly.  As for the program itself-  it works quite well, but asks for too much personal information and wants to store my financial data and access my bank accounts.  Not happening.  If you select the advanced setting and select enter data manually, you can use it without disclosing your bank account numbers and login information.\n",

Do not buy unless you enjoy re-setting up all your linked account every other time you use it.  I have given it plenty of time to &#34;work the kinks out&#34; but every update brings new pain.

The main problem is apparently (from our experience with the UI) that it forces the child to type very long passages using the current keyset before moving on to other keys or keysets. This blocks learning other keys, making it easy for the child to lose interest in continuing with the program. Yes, the island metaphors are cool, but being forced to overcome obstacles to get to the next island should only be provided as a game strategy in parallel to allowing a child to select and learn keys according to their wishes to keep progressing at their own pace.\n",

It took 6 days to get my program installed.  Sometimes it was days between emails.

I downloaded a bunch of free Codec packs, but that didn't work, so I bought a $33 program to convert my AVI files to MP4.  Not cool.<br />I wouldn't recommend this software.

Even text paragraphs that used to be in a single table with a line break in between for white space appear in individual boxes, and it's difficult to even copy and paste.<br /><br />I simply can't use this, and now I'm stuck paying them $19.99 a month for a year?  Well, no.  I was able to cancel my subscription within 30 days and buy Dreamweaver CS6 direct from Adobe for $249 since I had an old version of CS 5 with a serial number to use for the upgrade.<br /><br />That's it.  I'm FINALLY free of the Creative Cloud and have a product that actually works, even if it is less intuitive and has a worse interface than Microsoft FrontPage had in the late-1990s (yeah, I know it's code wasn't standard, but the interface and intutiveness and ease of use was night and day compared to anything we can buy now).<br /><br />Adobe should be reported and investigated.  This plan is outrageous and changing a product so radically is outrageous.  I found there are tutorials on YouTube but it's something like FOUR HOURS to go through!<br /><br />My needs are simple.

It's possible to botch your return with any package, but it's usually user error not a software flaw.\n",

      "3\tGenerally, I have enjoyed using this application.  However, recently, it seems to be abruptly shutting down on me.  After going through the steps to restore it, it just sends me in circles : showing there's a problem, showing that the files are restored, showing there's a problem, showing that the files are restored.  It's an inescapable loop.  In the past, I have left it alone and it has worked at a later time.  This happened today after several hours on the application.  Perhaps, it needs a rest from use.  Other than this glitch, it's great.  I like the PDF feature.\n",

It does everything Bitdefender does and it is free! Use it in conjunction with the Windows firewall and Malware and you don't need to spend a penny. To make matters worse, they charged my PayPal account for a renewal that I did not authorize and will not refund my money. Stay away!\n",

      "5\t\"[[VIDEOID:fb211e1dee933d6510c52810db02b54e]] I had the opportunity to test Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System in its Insider Preview Version, also known as Technical Preview Version that was released in April 2014 for Beta Testing for developers, I have been using it since April 2014 and wanted to point out several things to general public who are looking to upgrade or buy Windows 10 when its available on July 29th 2015. I want to give lots of info, but I will try my best to make it simple and short for all the readers.<br /><br />░░░░░INFO░░░░░<br />❖ Simple way to describe Windows 10: It combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7. Allot of people hated that Microsoft took away old Startup screen and If you look at few of my pictures below they kind of brought it back in Windows 10.<br /><br />❖ Windows 10 will be available in two versions: Home (price: should be 109.99) and Professional version (should be 149.99). And Windows 10 Mobile for smart phones.<br /><br />░░░░░WINDOWS 10 VS WINDOWS 8/8.1░░░░░<br />❖ Start Button is back<br /><br />❖ Cortana coming to PCs<br /><br />❖ Microsoft Edge, a new web browser for Windows 10<br /><br />*Users will be able to annotate any web page using finger/stylus or keyboard input.<br />*Spartan will have a reading mode.<br />*The Cortana voice assistant will be integrated into the browser.<br /><br />❖ The end of the password<br /><br />*According to Microsoft, users will be able to sign into commonly used apps like Outlook using a variety of biometric tools from fingerprint readers to retina scanners.<br />*You can still have password. But they are trying to make it harder to crack the password incase computer is stolen.<br /><br />❖ Multiple desktops windows, kind of like how apple has it on their computers<br /><br />░░░░░Prepare for Windows 10 install/upgrade░░░░░<br />❖ If you are running latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update You can reserve your free upgrade in the Get Windows 10 App. Once you reserve by providing your EMAIL ADDRESS, Windows 10 will download AUTOMICALLY when available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.<br /><br />This is from Microsoft website:<br /><br />\\\\\"\"Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />*NOTE: you must have all latest updates done on either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 in order to see the shortcut to reserve Windows 10. White windows logo Shortcut will show up where your clock is located on Taskbar notification area. I provided picture below that points to the icon with blue arrow in the picture.<br /><br />❖ Minimum System requirements to install the Windows 10 are:<br /><br />*Latest OS: Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.<br />*Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC<br />*RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />*Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />*Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />*Display: 1024x600<br /><br />░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░<br />❖ It actually has a Start menu now<br /><br />❖ Free upgrade for everyone (that's new)<br /><br />❖ Cortana, your truly personal digital assistant still available, its Microsoft version of Apple sari. It will be pre-loaded into Windows 10. Cortana will be able to provide regional specific answers to questions. Users will also be able to access Cortana's Notebook at any time to see what the AI knows about you and add or remove information.<br /><br />❖ Xbox is coming to Windows: Start recording gameplay in seconds, compete against console players, and stream games from your Xbox One console to your Windows 10 device from anywhere in your home.<br /><br />❖ Apps don't go away as seen in pictures below.<br /><br />❖ Office 2003 cannot be installed on windows 10. But 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming 2016 office will be compatible. I have tested 2007 and had minor issues. 2010 and 2013 work without any issues on Insider Preview Version of Windows 10.<br /><br />░░░░░CONS░░░░░<br />❖ Price is still up there. In case you are upgrading from XP or just going to buy a full copy. 109.99 or 149.99<br /><br />❖ Viruses are still an issue. Apple OSX has done a decent job. Apple can still catch viruses now days. But windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus. So antivirus is def. needed.<br /><br />This statement is form Microsoft website directly:<br /><br />\\\\\"\"If your computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, Windows Defender removes spyware, but to protect yourself from viruses, you'll need to download antivirus software. You can purchase it from a third party, or you can download Microsoft Security Essentials for free.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />From statement above I can tell you that Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender are useless. I personally dont even like the free Anti-viruses out their. I preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you. Every company will give you a free and then has a paid one. With paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it. That being said: there is not perfect antivirus out there. New infection arise on the internet every minute.<br /><br />As far as Apple OSX goes. Well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple. They verify apps or you will get a notification like: application is from unidentified developer. So viruses are little harder to create on Apple. But they are coming too. VS Windows computer: Microsoft doesn't care about who makes what, they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free Operating System.<br /><br />❖ Windows Media Center, and Windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer included.<br /><br />❖ Windows Live Essentials installed on your system, the OneDrive application is removed and replaced with the inbox version of OneDrive.<br /><br />❖ Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts Games that come pre-installed on Windows 7 will be removed as part of installing the Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft has released their version of Solitaire and Minesweeper called the \\\\\"\"Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\\\\"\" and \\\\\"\"Microsoft Minesweeper.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />❖ Watching DVDs requires separate playback software now. I USE VLC PLAYER ANYWAY. NEVER LIKED WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. VLC SUPPORTS FAR MORE FORMATS, INCLUDING BLU-RAY PLAYBACK.<br /><br />░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░<br />I think it's defiantly worth trying Windows 10. I still think Microsoft needs to test it little longer in Beta face before releasing it. It will have issues here and there like all their previous operating systems. But I think it will be have allot less glitches compare to Windows 8/8.1 release. Free upgrade why not. I will update this review again once the official version is released to general public.<br /><br />░░░░░FAQ(SOME OF THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED BY MICROSOFT ON THERE WEBSITE)░░░░░<br /><br />Q: Is the upgrade really free?<br />A: Yes, it's free. This is a full version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have one year from the time Windows 10 is available to take advantage of this offer.<br /><br />Q: How long does it take to install the upgrade?<br />A: Plan for about an hour for the installation. Newer devices may only take 20 minutes, and older devices may take more than an hour. You'll need to download the installation files beforeyou begin.

If your Windows7/Windows 8 was Professional or Ultimate: You will get Pro version automatically. If you have Home and want pro. You will have to buy it when its available on Amazon July 29th. Please note that Microsoft will provide Digital and DVD pack for Windows 10.<br /><br />Q: Can Enterprise customers get the free Windows 10 upgrade?<br />A: Enterprise customers with active Software Assurance subscription in volume licensing have the benefit to upgrade to Windows 10 enterprise offerings outside of this offer.<br /><br />Q: Will I get all of the features of Windows 10 once I upgrade?<br />A: Some Windows 10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market.

      "5\tI love digital scapebooking, and this is the program that makes it so easy to use my imagination.  It has all you need to tell a story, customize cards for any occassion, business cards and tons of stuff.  I do all my creations from scratch but it has premade temple which anyone can do.  I have uninstalled all other programs and only use PrintMaster. Awesome software!❤️\n",
      "5\tIf you have a Trojan virus and can not get rid of Shopani ads on your browser. GET THIS. I tried Spyware, Malware Bytes, Panda and NOTHING got rid of it. THIS DID. Bloody love it, don't I.\n",
      "2\tThe software has some powerful tools and the layout is very intuitive, there is one large issue however. The included codec for making MP4's seriously degrades footage from GoPro's. What started off as clean footage gets lots of introduced digital noise and color banding when exporting and rendering. The included codec simply cannot be adjusted to needed bitrate for GoPro's 1080 60p or 4K footage.<br /><br />Other than this issue the product is great, however being unable to produce a high quality video makes it next to worthless for me. $80 wasted,\n",

      "1\tValidate the serial number is a nightmare. Neither Adobe nor Amazon help solve the problem and the worst is that after you buy the product can not be returned. I will never buy a software through Internet.\n",
      "5\tNorton Security absolutely met my expectations.  It is simple to load (one does not need an IT department to load it) and runs just like Norton Internet Security.  Norton Security is a fine virus protection suite that does NOT slow down one's computer as other antivirus suites do.  Norton is a trusted name in virus protection and is extremely easy to use.  Getting 10 seats for the price I paid was a fantastic value!\n",
      "5\tWorked just fine-no problems. Others indicated issues with install--just need to know that the downloads don't automatically start--you need to go to your downloads tab to start them. I had zero issues and seems to be working just fine. Great to have an all in one product--glad I switched!\n",

      "1\tI really like Norton 360 Premier Multi Device - Now they went and fixed what was not broken - Might want to ask MS how well that worked for them (MS 8) - 360 was a complete package and did a great job keeping my computer, tablet, and phone safe - Norton Security does not replace it, rather, it forces one to buy 2 or 3 items to obtain the same level of protection and appears to be all bottom line driven - Further, it is far more labor and time intensive for the user - Shame on Norton - I am a retired software engineer and have been a Norton customer since the beginning - guess it is time to move on....\n",
      "5\tThis software works well for simple flow charts.<br />It;s also good for documenting system architecture.\n",
      "1\tTHIS SOFTWARE STINKS!!! I am a CPA and have been using TurboTax forever.  Due to the cutbacks it made this year I switched to H&R Block software.  It is so substandard, it really stinks!!!!  I updated my Federal Schedule D after I started the NJ return and IT WON'T UPDATE THE NJ RETURN!!!  How ridiculous is that?!  I chatted with a H&RB rep who told me that I should click on &#34;recalculate&#34; which I did and it did nothing.  He then told me that I need to uninstall the H&RB state of NJ software off of my computer and then reinstall it so that the NJ return would start from the beginning - that is NUTS!  I am going to re-enter the entire return, and go back to my overpriced Turbo Tax next year.  For those of you who are not professionals and might not be 100% sure of what you are doing, DON'T USE THIS SOFTWARE!!! Spend the extra bucks for TurboTax, it is worth it!!\n",

      "2\tAmazon has one of the most robust cloud strategies in the world.  The trouble is, most of their technology is not geared at consumers.  The strange thing is some of their competitors in the consumer market use Amazon as their back-end.<br /><br />As it stands today, this download is basically confusing and half-baked.  It serves only one purpose.  You drag files into it, and it uploads them into your account.  When I launched the program, it told me I had about 150 MB of space left (yes MB... not GB), but it had links telling me that it's now &#34;Unlimited&#34; for Prime Members, but that wasn't clear either.  Apparently unlimited only applies to photos.  Videos and other files are not unlimited.  They give you 5GB for that.  5GB isn't even enough space for 10 minutes of high definition video, so if you have a photo library that has videos, you're going to need to upgrade to the next level... the true &#34;Unlimited&#34; version, which is $59 per year.<br /><br />Assuming you get past all that, all this program does is let you upload your files by dragging them.  It doesn't sync, so you'll have to remember which files you uploaded, so you can remember which ones need to be uploaded later.<br /><br />Once the files are there, that's it.  It doesn't actually let you do anything with them within the program itself.  It gives you links to their web site to view or download them. One interesting thing about the website link was that it not only showed me files uploaded using this program, but it also shows you any personal documents such as PDFs and ebook files that you've uploaded to your Kindle.  It's interesting, but not useful, because I can already do that on the Kindle itself.<br /><br />I think Amazon needs to re-think their consumer cloud strategy.  It seems to me that they need to decide if they are serious about building a consumer cloud product.  As it stands right now, DropBox, OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive, iDrive and others are far more consumer friendly, and useful.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of the potential, not because it's actually useful today.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.  Questions and comments are welcome.and useful.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of the potential, not because it's actually useful today.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

      "1\tBEWARE, I bought this to upgrade from an old Quicken Essentials that was no longer being supported and it no longer imported my credit union transactions.  I bought QuickBooks Mac instead because of the bad reviews for the current Quicken version.  Unbelievably, this software does not download from my credit union either.  Even though they are on the list of banking entities.  When I called QuickBooks they got someone from my credit union on the phone who said that &#34;hopefully it will work by the end of the month&#34;.  The QuickBooks person apologized but her only solution was for me to manually enter each transaction (for 9 accounts), no thanks, for that I spent $182!  On top of all that it won't import any of my Quicken data into QuickBooks!!!!  Useless and no refunds!!!\n",

If I pay for something, I should be able to use the features on the box. OTHERWISE, don't advertise those features on the box. You can enter an employee's hours into the embeded timesheet, the software still isn't going to let you run a payroll check. If you are going to pay a monthly fee (scam) for software you bought for listed features, might as well use ADP! At least they are up front.\n",

      "4\tI find Family Tree Maker to be quite useful.  I do use it in conjunction with ancestry.com to manage my family trees for personal genealogy research, but I believe someone would also find it useful without an ancestry subscription.  Some of the features I've found quite useful are the ability to set up filters you can save to search for certain family members and to add your own fields and history notes.  I'm also using FTM to maintain family trees for characters in a novel I am working on.  The fact that I can add historical notes that will then be visible when reviewing specific characters is quite useful.  Some of the filters I've set up are to locate family members who might have been the right age to serve in the military during specific wars from the Revolutionary War to the present.  I've also set up a few to allow me to review deaths during periods when epidemics such as the 1918 flu were rampant in the area where the people live.  In each case, I'm able to produce a list of people then check for details that I might otherwise miss in their histories.  Considering that my main tree, which I began based on extensive research my grandmother started, contains nearly 2000 people, being able to set up such filters and save them is quite convenient.  Since I can add items to the history listings, and they'll show up alongside a person's dates, I can easily look at the individuals to see what kinds of records I might be able to find to support such things as their military service records.  You're also able to add notes on where you left off or what other things you might want to look at next so that, when you have to put down your research for an extended period and pick it up again later, you're able to get back into it without losing too much time figuring out where you were.<br /><br />You're also able to generate quite a few reports, including various standard charts and reports such as the Ahnentafel report, various trees, descendants, etc.  But you also have the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.  There's also an option to create a book based on your work.<br /><br />I've used earlier versions of FTM in the past.  I've been working on genealogy research for more than 20 years, off and on.  I find that the current versions of this software are much improved.  Syncing with Ancestry works well, though I've had a few mishaps when I didn't quite understand how to handle upgrades correctly.  For the most part, the software is pretty intuitive, if you're used to working on genealogy.  It is quite specialized, so someone who is new to genealogy work would really need to look at the manual for guidance when getting started.<br /><br />The software is quite useful and I'd definitely recommend it to others.  Though it does cost more than some genealogy software (I've used many other programs, including shareware and freeware products, as well), I believe you get a good value for the price.the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.

It was running okay minus the pop ups regarding scripts and having to hit close five times before they would go away and pop up again.  When I tried to use my computer today, I cannot connect to wifi at all. I plugged my computer directly to search the forum and did what it stated regarding KIS settings...network....local and still nothing.  I tried to go to Amazon and now computer keeps freezing up every time I try to open up something.  I have had to uninstall the product from my computer.  I cannot get a refund and I wasted a few hours of work trying to fix the issue.  What do I do?  :-(\n",

I need to download the whole cloud<br />library in order to get this file and if I have 1 TB of data on the cloud and my local hard drive is only 500GB (empty) I can't even do that. I also does not let you choose where you want to download all the data.  If always places it on your local hard drive.  So basically I can not retrieve that file ever again or unless I delete enough data from the cloud that it becomes as small as the available hard drive space.

      "5\t\"[[VIDEOID:8b0bb2fde15d6de473d91a89cd5bbe56]] I had the opportunity to test Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System in its Insider Preview Version, also known as Technical Preview Version that was released in April 2014 for Beta Testing for developers, I have been using it since April 2014 and wanted to point out several things to general public who are looking to upgrade or buy Windows 10 when its available on July 29th 2015. I want to give lots of info, but I will try my best to make it simple and short for all the readers.<br /><br />░░░░░INFO░░░░░<br />❖ Simple way to describe Windows 10: It combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7. Allot of people hated that Microsoft took away old Startup screen and If you look at few of my pictures below they kind of brought it back in Windows 10.<br /><br />❖ Windows 10 will be available in two versions: Home (price: should be 109.99) and Professional version (should be 149.99). And Windows 10 Mobile for smart phones.<br /><br />░░░░░WINDOWS 10 VS WINDOWS 8/8.1░░░░░<br />❖ Start Button is back<br /><br />❖ Cortana coming to PCs<br /><br />❖ Microsoft Edge, a new web browser for Windows 10<br /><br />*Users will be able to annotate any web page using finger/stylus or keyboard input.<br />*Spartan will have a reading mode.<br />*The Cortana voice assistant will be integrated into the browser.<br /><br />❖ The end of the password<br /><br />*According to Microsoft, users will be able to sign into commonly used apps like Outlook using a variety of biometric tools from fingerprint readers to retina scanners.<br />*You can still have password. But they are trying to make it harder to crack the password incase computer is stolen.<br /><br />❖ Multiple desktops windows, kind of like how apple has it on their computers<br /><br />░░░░░Prepare for Windows 10 install/upgrade░░░░░<br />❖ If you are running latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update You can reserve your free upgrade in the Get Windows 10 App. Once you reserve by providing your EMAIL ADDRESS, Windows 10 will download AUTOMICALLY when available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.<br /><br />This is from Microsoft website:<br /><br />\\\\\"\"Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />*NOTE: you must have all latest updates done on either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 in order to see the shortcut to reserve Windows 10. White windows logo Shortcut will show up where your clock is located on Taskbar notification area. I provided picture below that points to the icon with blue arrow in the picture.<br /><br />❖ Minimum System requirements to install the Windows 10 are:<br /><br />*Latest OS: Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.<br />*Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC<br />*RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />*Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />*Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />*Display: 1024x600<br /><br />░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░<br />❖ It actually has a Start menu now<br /><br />❖ Free upgrade for everyone (that's new)<br /><br />❖ Cortana, your truly personal digital assistant still available, its Microsoft version of Apple sari. It will be pre-loaded into Windows 10. Cortana will be able to provide regional specific answers to questions. Users will also be able to access Cortana's Notebook at any time to see what the AI knows about you and add or remove information.<br /><br />❖ Xbox is coming to Windows: Start recording gameplay in seconds, compete against console players, and stream games from your Xbox One console to your Windows 10 device from anywhere in your home.<br /><br />❖ Apps don't go away as seen in pictures below.<br /><br />❖ Office 2003 cannot be installed on windows 10. But 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming 2016 office will be compatible. I have tested 2007 and had minor issues. 2010 and 2013 work without any issues on Insider Preview Version of Windows 10.<br /><br />░░░░░CONS░░░░░<br />❖ Price is still up there. In case you are upgrading from XP or just going to buy a full copy. 109.99 or 149.99<br /><br />❖ Viruses are still an issue. Apple OSX has done a decent job. Apple can still catch viruses now days. But windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus. So antivirus is def. needed.<br /><br />This statement is form Microsoft website directly:<br /><br />\\\\\"\"If your computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, Windows Defender removes spyware, but to protect yourself from viruses, you'll need to download antivirus software. You can purchase it from a third party, or you can download Microsoft Security Essentials for free.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />From statement above I can tell you that Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender are useless. I personally dont even like the free Anti-viruses out their. I preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you. Every company will give you a free and then has a paid one. With paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it. That being said: there is not perfect antivirus out there. New infection arise on the internet every minute.<br /><br />As far as Apple OSX goes. Well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple. They verify apps or you will get a notification like: application is from unidentified developer. So viruses are little harder to create on Apple. But they are coming too. VS Windows computer: Microsoft doesn't care about who makes what, they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free Operating System.<br /><br />❖ Windows Media Center, and Windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer included.<br /><br />❖ Windows Live Essentials installed on your system, the OneDrive application is removed and replaced with the inbox version of OneDrive.<br /><br />❖ Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts Games that come pre-installed on Windows 7 will be removed as part of installing the Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft has released their version of Solitaire and Minesweeper called the \\\\\"\"Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\\\\"\" and \\\\\"\"Microsoft Minesweeper.\\\\\"\"<br /><br />❖ Watching DVDs requires separate playback software now. I USE VLC PLAYER ANYWAY. NEVER LIKED WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. VLC SUPPORTS FAR MORE FORMATS, INCLUDING BLU-RAY PLAYBACK.<br /><br />░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░<br />I think it's defiantly worth trying Windows 10. I still think Microsoft needs to test it little longer in Beta face before releasing it. It will have issues here and there like all their previous operating systems. But I think it will be have allot less glitches compare to Windows 8/8.1 release. Free upgrade why not. I will update this review again once the official version is released to general public.<br /><br />░░░░░FAQ(SOME OF THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED BY MICROSOFT ON THERE WEBSITE)░░░░░<br /><br />Q: Is the upgrade really free?<br />A: Yes, it's free. This is a full version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have one year from the time Windows 10 is available to take advantage of this offer.<br /><br />Q: How long does it take to install the upgrade?<br />A: Plan for about an hour for the installation. Newer devices may only take 20 minutes, and older devices may take more than an hour. You'll need to download the installation files beforeyou begin.

Click \\\\\"\"Customize\\\\\"\" in the System Tray and turn off the Get Windows 10 app notifications in the menu that comes up.<br /><br />Q: What edition of Windows will I get as part of this free upgrade?<br />A: If your Windows7/Windows 8 was Starter, Home Basic or Home Premium: you will get Home version automatically. If your Windows7/Windows 8 was Professional or Ultimate: You will get Pro version automatically. If you have Home and want pro. You will have to buy it when its available on Amazon July 29th. Please note that Microsoft will provide Digital and DVD pack for Windows 10.<br /><br />Q: Can Enterprise customers get the free Windows 10 upgrade?<br />A: Enterprise customers with active Software Assurance subscription in volume licensing have the benefit to upgrade to Windows 10 enterprise offerings outside of this offer.<br /><br />Q: Will I get all of the features of Windows 10 once I upgrade?<br />A: Some Windows 10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market.

Why say unlimited if you are going to restrict size?<br />B)  Their upload speed makes no sense.  It's not based on your ISP.  I am doing this at work with a clean fiber connection with 100MB upload.  I have to quit/restart over and over again because it keeps uploading at 4-5MB and after many many tries, it will jump to 70MB upload speed, which is what I expect to get.  Even in the middle of the night.<br />C)  It's stupid when you can create FOLDERS on the web portal but you can not upload to these folder from this app.  You have to upload it to the home folder and do a bunch of moving.<br /><br />How are you suppose to know when there's a new version of the desktop app?

      "1\tI only bought this because it said the product would be automatically upgraded after Feb 2015 (presumably because of the outrage Intuit generated by downgrading TurboTax Deluxe).  The product was not--repeat, NOT--upgraded, and now TurboTax is telling me I have to upgrade to Premier to do the same operations I've done for years with Deluxe.  The copy associated with this product at time of purchase therefore lies.  This is the last Intuit product I'll ever buy.\n",

      "2\tI used McAffee for the first time last year.  It's okay, though I prefer Norton.  McAfee seems to constantly pop-up throughout the year begging you to buy more stuff or add an automatic subscription.  To renew is 40 bucks, so I went back to Amazon to buy a whole new installation for $9.  I am now on the SEVENTH attempt to install.  Each time, it gets a little further before it stalls, so I guess I'll get there eventually.  I regret buying this, knowing I didn't like it last year.  I should have spent a couple of dollars more for Norton.  If Amazon gave refunds on software, believe me- I would can this mess.\n",

      "5\tBig improvement over Windows 8.1.  Faster than Windows 7.  Start Menu!!!  Working Windows key to launch Start Menu.  The Start Menu is customizable live tiles, sort of like the Windows 8 GUI only on a smaller scale.  It is cell phone size, so if you have a WindowsPhone it will be very familiar.  Customizable keyboard short cuts.  There is an option to turn &#34;Tablet Interface&#34; on or off and &#34;Boot only to Desktop&#34; option.  Could go on, but you get the idea.  When installing it will ask about music and video associations.  Suggest you deny until you see the Windows 10 interface.  MPC-HC x64 plays video better than Windows 10 &#34;Movies & TV.&#34;  * Install requires an email and password.  Recommend you set up an Outlook or Live (used to be called Hotmail) account to link to the OS before installing.  After Installation you can add additional email(s) if you want one click access through Outlook.  After install, your schedule and documents and ______ will all be linked and will follow you across multiple devices.  With the Outlook or Live account you will have free access to MS Office on the internet.  (Clear throat noise) Great for cell phones and temporary PC usage.

      "3\tFor 15 years I used Microsoft Money, even after Microsoft stopped supporting and selling the product.  When my spouse started a new business and we had to track expenses in more detail, I decided to upgrade to Quicken/Windows.  I did not like it as much as MS Money, but a large part of the dissatisfaction was likely due to my extreme knowledge of MS Money while having to learn about Quicken/Windows differences and idiosyncrasies.  However, we recently had to buy a new home computer and changed to an Apple Mac, so we had to change to Quicken/Apple.  What a disappointment.  The good news is that I was able to rather easily import all my past years' data (first from MS Money to Quicken/Windows and then to Quicken/Apple).  But there is more negative to report than there is positive.  There is significant functionality missing in the Apple version of software compared to the Windows version.  A few examples:  When viewing an account, you can not limit the transaction views to the unreconciled ones or just the last few months' transactions.  The only option is to have the screen list every last transaction you ever made in that account.  In my case, that can be 10 years worth of data, most of which I want to keep but not display at all times.  Reporting is very limited.  A small number of stock reports are available and they can be modified and saved.  But you can not export the report to a spreadsheet; you can only print it out or save a PDF of the report.  Quicken help tells you that to export the data which makes up the report, you have to manually export the raw data yourself and create your own report!  Not useful.  And when you want help from Quicken, there is absolutely no phone or live support.  Everything is done through forums & feedback on-line.  From what I read on Quicken's support forums and from my short experience so far, Quicken/Windows is where most of Quicken's technical support & development goes. They apparently have little interest or little desire to support the Apple version in an equivalent manner.  My suggestion is to stick to Quicken/Windows or find another vendor if you must use an Apple environment.\n",

Killing everything it encountered, quarantining everything in disarray..

As if I had just bought a new computer it started humming along, lightning fast speed, and running like a Mercedes.  I kid you not, this was bar far the best investment I have ever made.. It saved me hundreds of dollars and I got my sanity back..<br /><br />I only wish they made this in a liquid so I could pour a can in my old Chevy Silverado, but hey, I'm blessed, thrilled and happy as I have ever been.<br />Stop trying to make a decision, just buy this and get your sanity back.

      "1\tUpdate September 20, 2015<br />Tens of thousands of Windows 10 users have been crushed by a Critical Error and the Start Menu, Cortina, and Edge STOP WORKING AND MICROSOFT HAS GONE OFF THE AIR REGARDING THIS ISSUE SINCE LATE AUGUST.<br />There is a CATASTROPHIC ERROR within Windows 10 that Microsoft cannot solve.<br />You only need to put in Windows 10 Start critical error to see the thousands and thousands of Windows 10 users who are in trouble.<br />Unless you want to get stuck like us. DO NOT UPGRADE!!!<br /><br />Update Aug. 9, 2015:<br />My wife's Lenovo Yoga 3, also running W8.1, got her notice a few days ago and I upgraded it Friday night when she no longer needed it for work.<br />This experience was not as smooth. The download was about 2.5GB and took a while. After the lengthy download, it started similarly to the first time noted in the original review. Then a box appeared that said something like Please Wait--We're preparing for the upgrade. So I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, I went to bed and found the PC in the same state the next morning. Something must have gone wrong. Trying to close with the X did nothing. Using right-click and &#34;close&#34; on the task bar icon did nothing. So, I forced a shutdown using the on/off button and rebooted.<br />Then the upgrade pretty much went on its own. After another hour or two, it restarted and it's running OK. I have not used it much and will further update with more experiences.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Got my upgrade notice and immediately downloaded from Microsoft and upgraded my Surface Pro 3 with it.<br />The upgrade experience was seamless. The whole process took less than an hour with no intervention from the user except in the first few minutes to agree to the license agreement, etc. Then the upgrade ran itself, including restarting.<br />Then we have to select express or custom setup. The express setup essentially sends Microsoft all the data it wants regarding your surfing habits, location, default apps for pictures and videos, music, etc. I selected custom setup and picked and chose what I wanted to share. Again, this was fast and painless.<br />I'm using the Edge browser on Amazon to type this. It loaded fast and has worked seamlessly so far. However, I can't find a way to use setting to specify my multiple start pages, like all other browsers, and have to add as custom pages one at a time. Irritating.<br />I was also a tester for the preproduction versions. This is based on my experience with them as well.<br />The best thing is that Windows is now equally touch and keyboard-mouse friendly. You can have it in tablet mode and maximize the square icons display. You can also resize it to become a squarish start menu that occupies only the lower left corner of the display. The difference is that it shows live feeds such as weather, news, and stock market indices. It's as mouse friendly as it is touch friendly. Nice.<br />I timed the start up. It took about 12 seconds from pushing the power button on my Surface Pro 3 for the login screen to appear. The wireless took about 15 seconds to connect to my wi-fi. By the time I typed in my password, it's all good to go, 20 seconds or less. The fast start up of W8 was what prompted me to upgrade from W7 to W8 and I'm glad this was retained.<br />There is a prominent search window next to the Start icon where you can search without having to start a browser.<br />Next to Search is a Task icon. Clicking it brings all open apps in tiles on the main screen. It's not gimmicky at all and very convenient to switch tasks.<br />So far everything works as when I was using W8.1.

I should have paid more attention to disgruntled update customers, attributing most of that to being perturbed about being 'forced' to upgrade to continue some of the features you have become used to.  I have updated many times over past 15 years or so, and usually the upgrades offer little substantive improvement, but I have not had the disastrous experiences others have warned about in the past.  Not so this time, converting from QP 12 to QP 15 has resulted in one of the most annoying and frustrating afternoons I can ever recall.  It uploaded quickly enough, and my information may have been converted, but I have no way of knowing it because the screens are all screwed up.  The screen is mostly white, with data in thin ribbon on left, which will not enlarge.  I can occassionally get a screen by going to partial screen mode, but switching between accounts goes back to blank, and then, the program crashes.  After some frustration, I tried the chat line but after sitting there for an hour while trying to work with it, I have given up.<br />Right now I am so frustrated that I would like to get a copy of the 2012 version and install that, and reload my saved driver and forget the online services that Quicken uses to force these upgrades to a product that used to be good, but has not significantly improved if you transition smoothly, and if you have the kind of problems I encountered, it is a bad joke.<br />I am going to try to\n",

Discontinued support (and functionality) of prior version, Quicken Essentials for Mac (which was great, BTW), forcing users to the new 2015 version.  Putting aside issues with a less appealing user interface, the root of the problem is simple:  the software just doesn't work.  Transaction dialogue box states transactions downloaded, but then none show up under individual accounts.  Work around is to delete linkages then reestablish linkages, daily per each account (one at a time).  Neat, fun.  Absolutely no contact info for Support - just user forums.

You have the option of inputting transactions manually or downloading them from your financial institution (I keep my bank accounts manually, but download for my investment accounts). Also allows you to do tax planning/expense mapping to make itemizing and deductions easy each year.

      "1\tWe updated computers and software last year and I added QB. My old system used Aatrix payroll and I went for the intergrated option and got QB payroll. The monthly payroll fees are costing me $38 for 7 employees, that's $456 per year which is entirely too much. That's more than double what I was paying per year. There is no check designer, so they want you to buy checks from them, so that's another expense. I hand-type my payroll checks to avoid that expense. When I entered my back payroll, I ran into rounding errors on almost everybody so I had to jig with the figures to make the transition. When I entered the back payroll, I was assessed payroll fees just like QB had something to do with those payrolls, which it didn't. You know, I prefigure my payroll on a spreadsheet before I go on line to do the payroll. The way they are charging me, you would think that they are doing all my work! Additionally, the first time I was trying to do a live payroll, our internet went down and I had to go back to my old Aatrix program to do payroll, because QB is internet based. (My employees just wouldn't understand that they would have to wait until AT&T fixed our T line to get paid.)<br /><br />As this is an internet program, guess what, you don't get any kind of manual. They want you to go to FAQ's and find a problem kinda like yours so you can figure it out. I worked with the chat service. There is a big lag between responses like the chat line monitor is working with a bunch of people, so chat line service is really tedious.<br /><br />I haven't done any quarterly reports with QB, but because of the rounding problems I have encountered, I expect it to be a mess.<br />Overall, the program seems kinda clunky to me. I'm not particularly impressed with the look, design, speed, or ease of use.  But I can overlook a lot if the price is reasonable, but it is not reasonable.<br /><br />I see from other comments that it is also a sticky thing to transfer over to another program becausethey'll shut you out of your data.  I'll have to stay with them past the 4th quarter to get my information and start with somebody else.\n",

The conversions were relatively speedy--only about 20-30 minutes for a two hour DVD.  But then I started noticing that most of the files were incomplete; they cut off well before the end of the segment, with the image frozen for the remainder of the clip.  I tried converting these same DVDs using the free WinX converter software.  The WinX software had its own problems; but the image and sound quality was just as good as the Movavi conversions and, most important, all segments were complete.  I ended up using the WinX sofrware for the DVD-to-mp4 conversions and the Movavi software just to trim the files to the desired length.  I wrote to Movavi about the problem (with copies of converted video files to demonstrate the issue), but their eventual response--several weeks later--was incomprehensible, at least to me:  &#34;Please try to copy all the VOB files from your DVDs on your hard drive (please make sure not to copy INO files) and try to convert it again.&#34;  Translation for the non-tech types?\n",

It was so bad, i couldn't even click links on ccleaner or malwarebytes.  The malware stopped all options to download.  I couldn't install chrome or any other browser to avoid all the damage on IE..<br /><br />Finally got it clean and will install WR on her laptop.<br /><br />Now, the biggest issue with WR is their pricing strategy.  Many discuss it here, but the staff from WR are always vacant in their responses about this and ignoring it won't make it go away.<br /><br />When my sub expires in a few months, I likely will switch to Avast Free.  It's got great ratings, and in combination with Malwarebytes and ccleaner, it's a free solution without repaying year after year.<br /><br />Key to WR, and while i know you will ignore my post, as you've ignore ALL pricing references, the people who read these reviews ARE paying attention.  It is a terribly shortsited business model to make your repeat customer PAY MORE than new customers. . You can argue that it's a new customer bonus, but that's hogwash and you know it.  All you need to do is install it and it's on its own for the most part. And you can let it expire, reorder and get a new license for the best price you can find.<br /><br />Loyalty should be rewarded, not snubbed and mocked by insulting us by demanding we pay more than new customers.  Most companies offer the best price, in many cases lower than ANYTHING you can find online.. Some companies offer even lower advance or multiyear discounts as well.<br /><br />Come on WR, we're not insignificant, pay attention to us.  If we leave, you end up with nothing.\n",

(Have you finally go the message, now, with Windows Vista ... oops, I mean Windows 8?)<br /><br />The Office 365 product is OK ... I can use it on multiple devices ... but I just hate using MS programs, anyway.  And I don't like MS being able to keep such close &#34;track&#34; of me ... and such tight control ... of their products, through the internet.<br /><br />I suppose the advantage of having the &#34;latest version&#34; of these products is that ...well, you have the latest version, and it SHOULD be compatible ... and backwards compatible, with previous versions.  And the clear disadvantage, at least in my mind, is that the programs that you once knew how to use ... will change.  MS has been singly responsible for a substantial decrease in my personal productivity.<br /><br />With this type of software, at least through MS, you can expect that the second your subscription has expired, you'll no longer get to use your software, with out pulling your credit card out, again.<br /><br />When your subscription expires, you WILL be able to view your documents ... but will NOT be able to change them in any way.

As far as I know only Malwarebytes has the capability to intercept CrypoLocker. but its limited on what else it can do. Enter Kaspersky.  For some reason Kas can’t block CrypoLocker but it can block or quarantine a bunch of other  threats. As to installing Kas i had a recent problem using a Kas CD. My &#34;Malwarebytes&#34; would not let it install off the CD. Went to kaspersky.com and downloaded the trial version and.. Malwarebytes was OK with that process as I had giving my administrator approval it allow the down load in.  So I now I run both Mal and Kas on our PCs. But here’s the trick to it all.  “Automatically backup your stuff everyday”.  If you take a hit just tell the backup to start using an earlier date when you still had a clean machine.

      "4\tMy Norton antivirus subscription on my PC has just expired and I installed this. It remove the old antivirus before installing itself and update the latest Antivirus definitions. Pretty smooth with only 1 reboot required after installation. My experience with Norton is they protect the PC much better than those free antivirus software especially if you are those who are not so tech savvy. Those freeware websites like to install advertisers add-ons and then slowly disable your antivirus software. Many people has complain about how slow Norton is but my experience is that it is hardly noticeable especially if you use a SSD. The key is to remove any existing antivirus software/s else they will start scanning one another resulting in the lag. If you cannot install Norton antivirus, it is likely that your PC is infected. I would have given it 5 stars if the 5 licenses expiry dates are base on when you activate them. The expiry date for all 5 devices starts when you activate the first one. Hence, it is good to start all the licenses at the same time.\n",

No email from them, no notification when I prepared the extension. Apparently next year they are going to include the extra schedules in Deluxe? Why wouldn't they just make sure to keep all longtime customers happy. I will be doing my return by hand this year and for certain will never give Intuit another dime.

I had problems a few days after installing and chatted with a Norton rep who downloaded a program to control my computer and all he did was reinstall the program - wish he had just told me to reinstall because I prefer to make my own choices.  Also, once this program is on your computer  it's difficult to remove!  Very upset with Norton over this incident.  Also, the tech was nice but he checked to allow my computer to participate in Norton's Cyber Crime program but I don't like to because it slows my computer down having all these monitors and spies on it.  The tech lied and told me that Cyber Crime was required and it kept the program updated.  Not a big deal, just wish I had done a few things differently.  Appreciate the lower price on Amazon.  Another issue that I have with Norton is their hundred different prices.  Even with all of these little issues, I still value the services provided by Norton and appreciate the program keeping most of the viruses and spies off of my computer.\n",

It is these shortcomings that keep sketchbook Pro 7 from being my main tool for sketching - I find I still need CAD (ViaCAD) and Illustration (Inkscape) tools to create the geometry for many technical sketches, which are then finished off in Sketchbook and/or Krita.  This program is awesome with the pen on my Surface Pro 3.<br /><br />The perspective tool is great for the rectilinear stuff, but it would be really nice to be able to have a &#34;3D-smart&#34; ellipse tool as well (or at least one that allows you to &#34;save&#34; a few standard ellipse settings, so you could have multiple ellipse sizes to reuse like with a real ellipse template.  As it is, if you need to duplicate an ellipse, you have to spend a lot of fiddly time moving, rotating, and resizing the ellipse tool to only sort-of replicate an ellipse you drew before.<br /><br />Likewise, another huge addition would be the ability to create persistent construction/guide lines (preferably visible (but never printable) and active by layer) - like the ellipse tool, construction/guide lines are only defined until you reset the guide.\n",

      "1\tIt is not easy to get the program running for the Mac OS X based on the digital download, but it is possible (I am running Yosemite).  Fortunately I found instructions that helped me on another Amazon review (see the reviews on the Rosetta Stone French Level 1 for Mac [Download] page by sreenivas nukala for slightly different instructions if mine don't work for you- but my instructions borrow heavily from theirs).  Note that the Rosetta Stone site does not provide viable instructions on how to to get the download working correctly (at least not where I could find them).<br /><br />Anyways, here's what I did:<br />1. First download and install... you will then go through a number of updates.<br />2. Once you finish with the updates, you will be stuck with the Rosetta Stone program requesting a CD for the language files (You obviously don't have a CD, but you should have the language files). Close and Exit Rosetta Stone at this point.<br />3. I found the language files in the Rosetta Stone TOTALe mounted disk image that should have been mounted in your system as part of the install process, or you can look in the Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 for Mac  (Download) folder in your downloads folder and click on the RSItalianLevel1.dmg file to mount it . You can click on the Rosetta Stone TOTALe mounted disk image and see its contents- copy the file that ends in &#34;.rsd&#34;  (in my case the file name was &#34;SK-ITA-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.5.2.r2.rsd&#34;) .  Per the other directions, you can also find the &#34;language level file at Macintosh HD, Library, Application Support, Rosetta Stone, TOTALe.&#34;<br />2. Next, click into the following folders: Macintosh HD, Library, Application Support, Rosetta Stone, Language Training, AutoInstall (if you have Rosetta Stone Language Learning) Note: If you do not see a folder named AutoInstall, just right click in the white space and click New Folder from the menu that appears. You'll then be able to name it AutoInstall.  (I did not have the AutoInstall file and had to create it)<br />3.  Paste the .rsd file you copied in step one into the AutoInstall folder.<br />4. Now open Rosetta Stone and you should see a message saying &#34;Installing Languages&#34;.<br />5. It should be working now.have the AutoInstall file and had to create it)<br />3.  Paste the .rsd file you copied in step one into the AutoInstall folder.<br />4. Now open Rosetta Stone and you should see a message saying &#34;Installing Languages&#34;.<br />5.

It didn't occur to me that this could be such a problematic program, so I bought it.  I followed on-line instructions to convert the Windows file to a Mac file again and again without success.  Finally, I called Intuit, only to be told that there is no way to convert Quicken for Windows 2013 to Mac by yourself.  Instead you must upload your file to a &#34;secure&#34; website.  Although I was reassured by the Intuit agent that doing so would be completely secure, I was hesitant because, what else would they say?  At any rate, I did it because I do want to completely switch to a Mac platform.  I checked back for weeks, wrote e-mails to the support team, and the file was never converted and returned to me.  After about a month or more, I decided I just had to move on and so I recreated the accounts and downloaded all of the available data.  After entering 18 months worth of data, such as payee and category, for a dozen accounts, I found that I I could not reconcile the accounts.  After checking the monthly balance with the statement, Quicken still insisted that it had to be adjusted as it did not jive with the ending balance of the monthly statement, despite the fact that it did.  I called Intuit for a refund and they said it had been more than 60 days.  Based on the reviews, I'm going to try iBank free for 30 days.

I was not surprised to see the price has increased and I paid more money than I needed because a 3 user license was just fine for me.

My one concern used to be what would happen to the thousands of recipes i had entered if my computer died.  With the latest Cookn editions, all my recipes are saved on the cloud. Even better, they are accessible from my mobile devices as well as my desktop.  I love that I can automatically import recipes I've pinned on Pinterest.  I can also easily import any recipe I find on the web.  It really couldn't get simpler.  The clincher for me is the great customer service.  Whenever I've run into glitches with updates, the DVO team has always replied quickly and given me whatever information I needed to get the software working again.  I really love this aspect of Cookn.\n",
      "5\tI had trouble installing it but got help from aaaaaaAmazon and it works great . Plus I saved about $ 25. Very happy.\n",
      "3\tIt's a pretty good program just be sure you check the product comparison guide on the Reallusion.com home page. Know what you are getting because the standard $49 package does not have the timeline controls and 3D features that you really need for animation.  This Pro version costs more but does have better features and more content.  There is a learning curve.  You won't  be making feature movies in half an hour as some of the tutorials might suggest if you are new to this type of software.  The on-line tutorials don't bother to tell you they are using the Pipeline version of Crazytalk, the most expensive version of the 3.  Standard, Pro and Pipeline.  There's I-Clone too but that's another higher catagory.  When your watching YouTube tutorials be sure to look on the top bar left or right depending if you're using Mac or PC by the X / minimize bar.  This will show you what version they are using.  If they are using Pipeline you won't be able to perform some of the features that they are doing and it's disappointing. I felt a little bit deceived. That's why I'm only giving 3 stars although I should probably give it one more. It is fun to use.\n",

      "1\tThis software is really terrible.  I purchased the license for two years and its protected my computer for only about 50% of the time I've had it installed.  It constantly has an error message and in most cases, you can't even open it to see what the issue is.  It will not run any scans and if you go to the site to trouble shoot, there is a message that says something along the lines of &#34;if you are having trouble running a scan we know this is an issue and we're working on it&#34;.  If you try to get support by right clicking on the item in your tray, you just get a message that says &#34;We fixed the problem&#34; but the error error (exclamation point) is still visible.  This is one of the worst product experiences I've had in a long time.\n",

      "2\tDisappointing - we've used TT for years, but may switch next year.  Why?  The various 'upgrades' are less user-friendly.  The most annoying is TT's default for having to go thru their website in order to print out anything.  For our extension we actually went to the IRS website to download the form - TT wouldn't let us do that without going thru the website - ridiculous.  We've been printing out all the forms before without that extra step.  We'll see what happens when we complete the forms -\n",

      "1\tI read other people's reviews before I bought this but figured it would work well enough.  I was wrong.  I honestly can't believe how terrible Dragon Dictate really is.  The dictation simply does not work.  I can't get through two sentences without a mistake by the software.  Trying to fix the problem using the voice edit functions just adds more and more errors.  It takes me far more time to use Dragon Dictate than to just type.<br /><br />Frankly, this software is so buggy it is worthless.  If it worked like it was supposed it, would be great.  It reminded me of software you would get in the early 90s.  Awkward, buggy, difficult to use, does whatever it wants instead of what you tell it.  To add insult to injury, people who are used to working with Macs and Apple products, which work beautifully, seamlessly, and easily, will be infuriated by this piece of junk.  This software should not be on the market.\n",

I use Gimp and PDN, and they're good, but I was looking for something with a little more firepower, especially in areas of design.  I bought this on a whim when it was on sale, and I couldn't be happier with it!  It's chock full o' great features.  Some of my favorites are the perspective guides and rulers.  There are also a ton of brushes that come equipped, which is fantastic!  If you're new to digital painting/drawing, or are looking for something that can either mimic a pencil on paper feel, or provide great design, inking, and coloring options, I'd highly recommend Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7.\n",

      "2\tEven though the reviews on this weren't the best, I tried this because I couldn't get AceMoney to work with my USAA banking accounts. And when I called USAA technical support, they said they didn't support AceMoney and suggested Quicken. But after trying Quicken for a little while, I decided that I liked the user interface on AceMoney much better. It was much more intuitive, and I was able to find what I wanted to do considerably faster because I didn't need to drill down through multiple levels of menus. So I went back to AceMoney, looked through their support forums, and was able to get it running with the my USAA accounts. Since I'd already purchased this Quicken, I left it installed side by side with AceMoney in case I ultimately found something that Quicken could do that AceMoney couldn't. But after several months of use, I've yet to find anything to drive me to try Quicken again.\n",

      "5\tThis is the third year in a row that I have purchased a Norton subscription. Prior to Norton, I always bough McAfee Security products but the student pricing convinced me to purchase Norton. I have continued to purchase Norton security products since as they work great on all of my devices. I have Macs and PCs and it is great that my subscription easily works on all of them. It is an easy to use software that also has an attractive interface. I have never had virus or malware problems on any of my computers since getting Norton installed. The only concern I have is that the firewall can sometimes make it difficult to connect to my network attached devices, but it is pretty easy to change the settings to fix the problem.\n",

The software would not apply the credit I receive for paying Kansas taxes.  (My wife and i both live in Missouri, and work in Kansas).<br /><br />I spent about 6 hours on the line with their tier 2 support before they finally asked me to discontinue using the state software, then print out and file my own state taxes.  No refund was offered.  I have the case number if anyone is interested.\n",

Wondershare has designed the program to match the user interface of the most current Microsoft Office (Office 2013 at this writing) and it functions so flawlessly that others who've seen me use it have asked why their Office suite doesn't include PDF Element. If you work with Office, you already know how to use the common features of this software.<br /><br />My work requires me to send and receive several PDF documents a day; with PDF Element I'm able to make any needed edits or conversions quickly and easily. As with any PDF software, poor-quality originals will require more effort to convert; however, PDF Element has properly dealt with several artifact-ridden scanned pages for me which competing programs couldn't touch.<br /><br />I'm very happy with Wondershare PDF Element and recommend it.\n",

Problem is it the default format it saves in can't be opened by the prospective employer unless they have the same software. You have to remember to hit the export as a PDF or Export a Word doc button to save in a universally accepted format. Also the software attaches cover letters when you send from within the program and you can't view the resume and letter as one file. I also can't figure out a way to export just a letter as a PDF or Word doc so that I can send it or review it separate from a particular resume.\n",

Since all but being forced to upgraded to this version, I read all the negative reviews and was apprehensive.  However, Quicken guarantees your money back if not satisfies, so what did I have to lose? I'm happy to report they finally got the message and addressed the flaws!

      "4\tI have been using Norton 360 since 2009 and never had a problem. I was unhappy to learn that there was only one more year for Norton 360 and it had been downgraded from the one I knew and trusted. Now for the product at hand. Do not install it unless you delete whatever Norton security that is on your computer or it will do it but it will lengthen your install by about an hour. The install itself is pretty straight forward. and I have installed it on four computers, one each of Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Saw no real difference in the installs and it works well on all. I can not comment directly on whether as some have said it takes less resources and your computer in turn runs faster. Mine does, but I made other changes at about the same time. Due to this I can not say whether it was totally Norton. Like all Norton products, it goes about its business and protects your computer. I have it set up to automatically scan the computer which I never did before and it seems to work well. Unlike Norton 360 which told you when it last updated the virus definitions, it only tells you they are up to date or not. I had to call Norton to find this out as it is not obvious at least to me. You loose the ability to do Registry cleanup which was great after you deleted a program. Everyone who buys this product should complain to Norton, maybe they might put it back as it should be. The best thing is that it can be used on any wired or wireless product you have.\n",

I've used just about every anti-virus program out there but Kasperksy is always well designed and it doesn't bog your system down.  I do not plan to switch products again.  If you know you have an anti-virus program running, that is a problem.  With Kasperksy, you hardly notice that it's there.  It's a great product from a well established company.  Give it a try.\n",

I called to cancel the renewal and the tech support 100% did not understand English. It literally took me 23 minutes to give my email account to the women on the phone. then another 15-20 minutes to have her inform me that she can not refund my money and that I had to go to a website to get it refunded. I took down the website and it did not work So I had to call in again to get this site read to me by a fluent English speaking person. They again were very difficult to understand, but it took me 15-20 minutes instead of the hour spent on the previous call.\n",

They all fade in with the background.  Why M$ insists on the Fisher Price scheme with garish colors for Windows 8 (and for 10 it appears) but eliminates colors almost altogether for gray icons and buttons is beyond me.

There is no program that is bulletproof but Norton comes close. Yes, previous versions have taken up system resources but compared to other companies Norton provides the best overall system  protection available. The internet is like the old west, an open frontier that can be hazardous. Norton is easy to install, maintain, and is capable of running in the background with little or no user input. Norton will protect you and save you money. You get ten devices, they can be computers, tablets, phones, or any combination. Devices can be managed by logging into &#34;Manage Devices.&#34; You can delete a device and get back the license for that device, allowing you to install on another device as many times needed. You just can't have more than ten active devices at once. Your computer guy will thank you and I thank you. Please click yes if this helps, thanks. JJ\n",

They stay in touch and are very honest about your issues. I decided to take a chance at upgrading to the new version and it has features beyond what I expected.<br />First of all, I am the keeper of the family recipes. Some of these are very old and I couldn't figure out how to digitize and save them so I was loading them in Word. This program will capture them from a scan and even keeps a copy of the original. It's so incredible to read Mom's recipes in her handwriting on my computer! I can surf the net and download recipes into the program and for ONCE!!! everything is in one place. I no longer have a little cookbook on every site with a few recipes in it.<br />If you're a cook, or a baker, or just like to think that &#34;you'd like to make that someday&#34;, this software is really what works.

      "1\tI will NEVER buy another third party software download product from Amazon nor any Intuit product again, after my experience with a TurboTax 2014 download. Don't get me wrong, I use Amazon frequently and like their service and a loyal TurboTax user for 20+ years. But I will not buy someone else's software through Amazon ever again. I mistakenly downloaded the WIN version rather than the MAC version when I purchased TurboTax 2014 Premier through Amazon. Amazon and Intuit both say they stand behind their products, but read on before you buy downloadables. I do not own a Windows computer so the software was no use to me. Amazon said I had to seek a refund from TurboTax since there is no physical disk to return to them. I did so, filing a claim after following TurboTax's hard to find claim procedures. After about three months with NO REPLY from TurboTax, I tried to call them. (Good luck trying to find an actual phone number to call.) I followed all their instructions and submitted my claim again, which I was told has to be reviewed by a &#34;team&#34; of reviewers to determine whether my claim was legitimate. For about three more months, I heard nothing from TurboTax, so I sent monthly follow up emails reminding them they are supposed to be considering my claim and repeating the details of my claim. Nothing. And this is on the heels of the fiasco last year with TurboTax pricing that caused many loyal customers to jump ship. Then, finally, an email saying that if my claim is approved, I can expect a refund check in the mail in 8-12 weeks. That was about 3 months ago. Not a word, not a check. Nothing. I can only conclude that Intuit is not a reputable company. I am also disappointed in Amazon, which seems not to have figured out how to provide customer service for digital download products.\n",
      "3\tThe download worked and installed OK but when I checked for updates there was a new version available on the developer site so I ended up doing back to back downloads.\n",
      "2\tI not only don't like it, I paid for it hoping it would work, and so far I have not be able to get it working.  I've tried to contact Adobe and Amazon, and so far have had no response from either.  I won't buy another Adobe product again.  Sad thing is I am out $79.00.\n",
      "5\tThis is great!  I upgraded from Version 10 and particularly like the Scan feature.  Time to tame the beast that is all of my recipes.\n",
      "4\tI read all the reviews and frankly most of the issues listed had to do with computer settings or monitor settings therefore Operator Errors and not the software.  That said, Intuit customer service is nonexistant.  So if you are not really software savvy, I mean really certified in usage of several software programs you will have a learning curve when using this software.  This package assumes you have at least a midrange skillset with software.<br /><br />The program has had very few issues, I use it to the fullest. Actually some of my clients prefer this package so it is one of the several I use to assist them in their record keeping.  It has been so adaptable that several clients with over twenty rentals, other businesses on the side as well as other incomes generated are easily kept current of where they stand.  It is easy to view balance sheets, EOY, Assests/Liabilities, Stocks,Sales Tax, Property Tax, Business Taxes and  Annual tax information as well.  Setup does take some time for each new client who prefers this product as they are smaller scale, but it is well worth it in ease of use.<br /><br />For those with issues, perhaps you could take a class on setup and usage in varous software programs.  When you become certified in four or more packages you will find new confidence, fewer issues as well as a new joy in resolving work related issues.\n",

However, being forced to upgrade by the threat of removing that addiction is just plain old blackmail.  To add insult to injury, the program keeps getting worse.  Loaded with features your average user won't ever use, and your power users will discover are broken, these releases become more buggy every year.  Not to mention the shear anxiety that now accompanies every use.  At one point, all my downloads went to &#34;temp accounts&#34; and some came up with data that just wasn't right.  I had to put the whole thing aside and work on it when I felt up to corrupting 30 years worth of data (yes, I keep backups - I just hate having to go through data restores - don't trust the whole process and I have 25 years in IT).  If I could have stayed with the 20xx version I would have.  I'm guessing the whole personal finance software business is kind of a loser since they couldn't seem to care less about a product which was once the flagship of their organization....\n",

I had a current backup of our last Quicken file from the old computer.<br /><br />I don't know where to start.<br /><br />Quicken corrupted the data file including our payee list. Repeated attempts reload the file from backup failed, and the various data validation and fix programs suggested by the \\\\\"\"help\\\\\"\" personnel did nothing.<br /><br />Despite working with our very helpful bank people several times, Quicken 2015 insists that the bank is \\\\\"\"blocking\\\\\"\" Quicken and it cannot connect.  Bank personnel have checked everything at their end, and they insist that they are not blocking anything.<br /><br />We cannot send a payment to anyone using Quicken 2015.<br /><br />We've had a number of very frustrating 1 hour sessions over the last two weeks and the expensive program can't perform a single one of the simplest banking functions.<br /><br />It can't keep track of our balance, and it can't send a check.<br />I have no idea whether its advanced investment functions work, and I don't care.<br /><br />I'd like to see Quicken produce a \\\\\"\"Quicken Simpleton\\\\\"\" edition that just works the way it did 10 years ago.<br /><br />Oh, almost forgot.  I've tried the Chat line several times. I won't reproduce the conversation here, but several other people have and you should read those.  I'm not even sure that you're \\\\\"\"chatting\\\\\"\" with a human being.  The responses sound like a computer, or maybe a person rigidly reciting a script. They suggest the same thing over and over and when that doesn't work they suggest it again.  And they waste time saying \\\\\"\"I understand that must be very frustrating.\\\\\"\" and \\\\\"\"I'm very glad you have come to talk to us.\\\\\"\" and \\\\\"\"Is it OK if we do that now?\\\\\"\"<br /><br />You send them a description of your problem at the beginning of the session, and they either do not or can not read it.<br /><br />They are neither experts in the program, nor, I suspect, native speakers of English.<br /><br />So. The program is worthless and useless, riddled with bugs so it can't perform the most basic functions.  There is no useful support from the company. They've got your cash, so they don't care.<br /><br />A complete waste of money. We are looking into our bank's free bill pay service, and our 20 year relationship with Quicken is over.\"\n",

      "2\tThis software has worked great for me of the last few years.  However, starting a few weeks ago I was having weird issues with my PC where I was unable to connect to the internet.  I wasn't able to access the network and sharing center either.  I search around, via my phone, but wasn't able to easily determine the issue.  I decided to do a system restore but when I clicked the icon, it wouldn't open!  So I went into safe mode and did a system restore from there; followed by a complete system scan.  Everything seemed fine for about a week until it happened again.  Same thing, did a system restore in safe mode and an even more thorough scan.  Everything was good for about a week or two and again, unable to connect to internet.  At this point, I suspected Avast may be the issue.  I went to msconfig to try and stop it from booting on startup, but it wouldn't let me!  I booted into safe mode and disabled it from there and restarted.  Upon startup, I was logging into the internet.  After reading several RECENT negative reviews on the product, I decided to remove.  The last few weeks have been frustrating and I hope that Avast can work to improve their product.  But for now, I look elsewhere for internet security.\n",
      "4\tCould not get the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack to Install using the add new features instructions that came with the product key that I bought from Amazon.com .<br />I spent over an hour on the phone with Microsoft and , let one of the<br />support guys have access to my computer only for him to tell me that I<br />needed to schedule an appointment with a stage 2 technical support rep. and<br />that it would be Friday July 24,2015 before they could even work on the<br />problem. So, I went ahead and scheduled for 9 to 11 am Friday. When I got<br />off the phone I was disappointed that I couldn't get the windows 8.1 pro<br />pack installed. But, I kept thinking about it and went on line and found a<br />few reviews of people that have had the same problem with it saying that<br />the product key was good but, the program say that there was a problem and<br />to contact the website for support. Then I found a review that one customer<br />had the same problem but, he was able to uninstall the Mcafee anti-virus<br />and tried it again and the 8.1 pro pack installed fine. So, I decided to<br />give it a try. I uninstalled my McAfee All-access security program and<br />followed the instructions that I printed for the product key and low and<br />behold it worked. Everything installed like it was supposed to. And, I<br />reinstalled McAfee security and activated my Windows 8.1 Pro with Media<br />Center. Evidently, the security program wouldn't let me upgrade without<br />uninstalling it first.\n",

      "4\tI have tried several recipe organizers and this one is the best.  There have been a couple of glitches, but the staff is extremely responsive and answer the same day.  They are also always updating their editions to fix problems.  Entering recipes is a pain, but it is going to be so.  I have collected cut-out recipes for 25 years and pasted them into 2 large books.  I tried the scanning method to enter them, but that is nearly as time-consuming as entering them by hand...  I have made changes over the years or I like to give different instructions than those written.  So it took me several weeks to enter my 400+ recipes.  I now have a copy of the program on my Envy tablet-PC (couldn't easily find this, so the help desk at DVO sent me a link) and also the app on my android phone.  It is super handy to be able to look up the ingredients of a certain recipe right on my phone while at the grocery or just at home making up menus.  It is also easy to read from the tablet or phone while preparing the recipes in the kitchen.  I have not had problems w/ the app crashing, except at first on my husband's IPad.  It eventually worked, and no problems since.  The main difficulty is syncing between all of those devices when I add new recipes.  It can be done.  I have found I need to close the desktop version so that it saves and backs up.  Then I close all of my apps on other devices.  Then open the desktop and press the cloud-shaped sync button.  Then open each app and press the sync.  After all that, the recipes are all in the same places.  But considering I don't intend to enter a bunch of new recipes in the future, this is not a bad procedure.  I have tried the menu planning and grocery list process.  The instructions online are quite confusing.  But once it gets going, this is a very handy feature.  I have been writing menus and grocery lists by hand for years, so this will be helpful.  The only complaint is that the 'pantry' items like spices are listed on the grocery list....  It would be super handy if you could mark off things you have on hand so that they would not appear in the list.  My other suggestion would be that when entering recipes that some common instructions would somehow be available as drop-downs or something.  I had to type 'minced' 'chopped' 'softened' so many times that it drove me crazy.  Overall, it is a great product.  It is worth the investment of time and money.  If you have problems, contact the DVO people; they are great!\n",

      "4\tThis isn't a video capture card; it's much more. If you can get the video/photos/sound thru your computer to your monitor, Screen Capture can put it on a hard drive, big thumb drive, or &#34;the Cloud&#34; for you.You have old VHS tapes you want on a media server? You can &#34;get there from here&#34;, most easily thru a Wi-Fi connected AVR. &#34;Copyguarded&#34;? Don't worry, what you see on the screen of your monitor is what you'll record. Want to record from Amazon Prime or Netflix(tm), or the &#34;encrypted&#34; sources like Vudu(tm) ? Stream them to your computer, and pick them off the screen in 4K if you want to (BIG files!), then you can burn them to H.264/Blu-Ray, or keep them on the bargain USB 3.0 terabyte drives available. You are doing this for your our PERSONAL use and NOT to circumvent any legal agreements to the otherwise. (Lawyer-speak.) I gave it 4 stars as there's no 4.5. There is SOME generational loss from the source to the file, which is an aggregate of video artifacts you won't get around from every source without spending $2500 or up on hardware/software. On a 46&#34; class &#34;2K&#34; upverting SONY(tm) Bravia from a viewing distance of about 8 feet, from an &#34;HDX&#34; source (a little better than Blu-Ray), the file streamed via my media center (20 gig, 2 hour movie) only shows some time base error artifacts. The picture is not QUITE as good as a good commercial Blu-Ray disc. I've worked in professional video since 1968 with 1/2&#34; reel-to-reel black&white video (PORTABLE!) and with the old 2&#34; broadcast recorders and digital now. I'm super-picky.

Once you get the hang of it, animating is fun and I can't imagine can be made much easier.  Some people apparently want to be able to make a cartoon in five or six clicks of a mouse - although it is a probably as close as you can come to it!  This software is designed as an intro to creating powerful custom animation.<br /><br />No powerful software comes without a steep learning curve.  It does have a 'beginners' mode.'  If you want to buy this software and use it be prepared to spend a lot of time and then you will find its value.<br /><br /> But:<br />Their support system stinks.  Even after registering they won't give me the debugged upgrade to 10.3(or whatever it is and still be 10) - When I click update in their menu they give me window saying...&#34;BUY version 11! - only ----- dollars.&#34;  That's bizarre - I've never seen a company make just an upgrade of a current version so difficult.  Most companies WANT you to have the best possible version of what you paid for.  Just getting signed into their support boards and registering the software was huge hassle.<br /><br />Help is limited to online support boards which only have answers to complex esoteric things and are not designed for people starting.<br /> Usually you can look on the internet for support for common software, especially games, but this is too esoteric to find little things.  You can find videos on it on YouTube.<br /><br />So the company that makes/sells this, Smith Micro... leave a lot to be desired in support.

I have printed one cookbook for all of my children for Christmas a few years back and plan on doing another one this year. I love the way that my laptop, i-pad and i-phone work with the cookin' cloud. I have my recipes where ever I go. I love being able to email them to my family and friends at the drop of a hat. They never stop improving it, and work very hard to do anything for their customers. I also have to add, that it is very simple to use, and the live recipe feed is so very cool!!\n",

      "4\tBenn using Quicken for almost 20 years now.  It always does a good job with the things that I need it to do.  I gave the latest release 4 stars because I seem to be having trouble keeping my bank accounts tied-in for automatic updates.  I've had to reset the on-line accounts several times on different accounts because they had stopped updating on-line.  That said everything else works well and the mobile app seems to do a pretty good job as well.<br /><br />I would suggest a cloud file storage system that would allow you to access/use Quicken on multiple computers depending on where you are.  It would be nice to be able to work from my laptop at home, work computer at work and/or have my wife use her laptop to get in and add bills, pay bills, etc.  Best way to do this would be using the cloud.  I actually use iCloud to host my working file and so far it seems to work OK but I know Quicken does not recommend this and several glitches I've experienced could be a result of trying to use iCloud for my working files.\n",

I have spent 7+ hours over the past several days....been given two case numbers and have been back and forth on the phone and through email for hours trying to get the online banking problem fixed. I am beyond exhausted. Especially frustrating to have them upload my company file and tell me it's fixed...after waiting for 3 days, only to have all the same issues.

      "4\tUPDATE: Upgrading to four stars: much better than I thought. You still can't pay bills directly through the program, but updating is easier than in Windows, and a lot faster. I find it easier to edit and use split transactions. Missing: auto backup and &#34;copy transaction.&#34; I do miss those, but if you use a Mac, you might find the rest of the program to be better.<br /><br />I'm retired, so I no longer need a lot of features, just lists of deposits and expenditures, balances. It does this fine. I can't pay my bills through Quicken, but I like paying them through the bank website better anyway. However, Quicken for Mac does not present a list of downloaded transactions for me to review and modify. This is the worst part for me, along with the fact that I can not download Regions Bank transactions with the Mac version like I could with the Windows version. However, not having to go to Windows to use Quicken is a major benefit for me, so I'm using it. It is definitely an ugly stepchild though.\n",

I've always loved the idea of having software to manage my bills, but I've found few products that make this actually work.  Adding to this review, the refund process from Quicken is terrible. Even thought it has been purchased on Amazon and could easily be refunded through Amazon, Quicken requires an emailed receipt. According to their website, &#34;Refunds will be processed with a paper check within 3 - 4 weeks.&#34; Seriously? Their customer service and their product are back in the stone age.

      "5\tI've had none of the issues mentioned.<br /> I have all the more expensive editing software and find this easier and faster to use.<br />However, It does seem slower than v12, but that may also be attributed to editing larger files in higher bit rates.<br />One issue I've never been able to resolve is to save my Windows settings.<br />I have to restore down every time and also resize the review window and timeline.\n",

On the list it says &quot;12-month plan $9.99,&quot; which changes to &quot;$9.99 per month,&quot; which really means &quot;12-month plan $119.84.&quot;  I realize that Microsoft also uses a 12-month subscription model, but this seems to be a bait and switch.<br />Hopefully, this is an error that Adobe will correct - but this is what the product listing looked like on 7-22-15<br />Having achieved some degree of familiarity with these complex programs, I would caution beginners not to expect to know if this program meets their needs within one month.\n",

It begs the question - if that's your mindset, what will you do next to your users detriment?  We know its free of cost for most, but you must understand that you still have a responsibility. With that statement, I hope you will not consider pulling the plug on your service so people lose their files.

      "1\tBeen using Quicken since it was DOS.  This is the worst version yet.  It downloaded a bunch of stock splits that I now can't get rid of.  They don't match reality and no matter what I do I can't get rid of them.  I also loose connections to my online financial accounts, different ones every time, probably two or there a week.  Their &#34;FIX&#34; either locks up my computer or just doesn't work!  So I do it manually.  It would also be nice if you could export out of quicken into a fresh quicken file.  Example:  I wanted to separate out my son's brokerage and savings account into a new file.  You can export into a CSV but good luck mapping the fields when you try to import them into the new file.  I tried copying the file and deleting the accounts I didn't want but then I had all these Ghost accounts that I couldn't find to delete.  I finally had to start from scratch and lost all the history and now have to go to a backup of the original.  Online help is useless, basically reinstall.  Don't bother it doesn't help!  This is probably a good application if you have limited data and limited history.  Did I mention the reports are horrible and tedious if you want to customize.\n",

If you have any issues with getting it to work or issues with anything including billing, etc. you have to go through there web page support which doesn't appear to have anyone on the other end and no one returns my inquiries.<br /><br />Product does work on the Mac however.  Not as good as Nero but only solution for the Mac.  I did buy the plugin and Blu-rays burn fine though I was billed twice for the plugin.<br /><br />I wish there was an alternative seeing as how it's so difficult to contact someone if you need support.\n",

The formatted resume cannot be saved, however you can save (I think it was called) the &#34;electronic&#34; format. It is not a format that would be given to a possible employer but would at least save the resume information for future use. My suggestion is to have all information and resume paper on hand so that you do not waste time searching. Some of the job suggested script is a little hokey and unrealistic. All in all, it will provide many (40 I think) resume formats and a cover letter on the trial version. I would not pay over $15 for this.

      "5\tPanda Free Antivirus 2015 was just rated the BEST free antivirus by PC Magazine, and several impartial Information Technology testers on YouTube!  Detection and elimination rates are very high, and in some cases, perfect!  I have also read that this cloud-based Panda product outperforms many commercial antivirus software suites that one has to pay for!  In my specific case, I was getting sick and tired of paying a rapacious yearly renewal fee for my Norton360 antivirus (about 90 dollars!), when it was available online for much less!  One would thank that Symantec would charge a steady, loyal customer less for their product, not more.  So I removed (cancelled) Norton360 from 3 of my PC's, and installed Panda Free Antivirus 2015 on them.  I also continue to use Malwarebytes (a free anti-malware, anti-spyware software) as a second line of defense (I do periodic scans), and I have had no issues or infections.  Panda Free Antivirus 2015 is a highly effective, proven, free antivirus package, scans quickly, has a good simple interface, and is light on your PC's resources.  In short, it's perfect!\n",

But search we must, as I refuse to bow down to their model of indentureship-(pay monthly or you don't get to use it!!).<br />No thanks Adobe. I tweeted when you announced this horrible, non-thinking of your loyal users- attitude that you just put a noose around your neck. If Corel would wake up and Xara steps up to the plate, anyone could create a Dreamweaver clone and we would buy it in droves.

      "5\tI'm a small business owner and I started out with Quickbooks. Used that for a few years and wanted to upgrade. I'd heard alot of good things about Xero, so I gave that I try. WOW! It's a quantum leap ahead of Quickbooks. So much more user-friendly, intuitive, and more powerful. Xero streamlined a number of important tasks for me (invoicing is so much faster now, and clients love my new online invoices). They keep releasing great new features. I read that Quickbooks online had to scramble to update their software when Xero first launched. Bottom line: Xero is the more innovative player in this competitive space, and they are knocking it out of the park!\n",

      "2\tThe one big flaw in this typing program for me is the virtual keyboard. Users should have the option to hide the virtual keyboard when practicing lessons. The virtual keyboard sometime trips up my brain when learning new key strokes by showing what key to press before my brain has enough time to process the movement. If a user is slow to press the appropriate key then the virtual keyboard shows on the screen which key should be pressed. I can see how this is beneficial for some users nonetheless there should be an option to hide the virtual keyboard in lessons for users that may find it a distraction. There are options to hide the virtual hands but not the keyboard.\n",

When balancing your checkbook, can you sort checks by name?  No.  Or by amount?  Not that, either.  Or by check number?  Sorry.<br />My advice is: talk to your accountant and bookkeeper.  If they really can't work with a program other than QuickBooks, then decide how badly you want to keep them.  If you want to keep them enough, hold your nose and buy QuickBooks for Mac.\n",

This is about as &#34;hands-off&#34; as any program can be and does not slow down my oldest computers.<br /> Yes, I reccomend this product and company based upon my experience. They put out a self running product that is far superior to the big brands that start with the letter &#34;N&#34; (the sewer worker) and &#34;Mc&#34;, both of which severely throttled my crappy computers. IOLO works seamlessly with the fast workstation boxes that we use in engineering and CAD/CAM.<br /> That is what matters to me. The IOLO was able to repair the mess that Art Carney and the Scottish name did on my boxes. For those that want a program that fixes and blocks problems; here you go.<br /> I have no connection to the company other than being a paying customer. I am only looking at the stuff again as my yearly subscription has expired.--------------- I suggest buying the full load as the System Mechanic portion cleans up your old buildup of trash. Besides, IOLO has never fouled up my wanted software.<br /> I hate the &#34;five-star&#34; review as there is always something wrong with any product. My complaint is that I don't get it for nothing; otherwise your experience will likely mirror mine. It is pretty nearly perfect in that it is completely effective so far, and it takes no maintenance input other than paying for it.\n",

Installation is easier now that there is an email-directed installation protocol. I installed this on my smartphone in minutes. I sent my email address FROM my phone TO the Norton site (there is a place under your account that says \\\\\"\"add a device\\\\\"\") and I had it up and running in no time.<br /><br />This software is not 100% proof against all malware--last year, I did get an infection from a very clever piece of malware that used a trick to get installed and the previous edition of the software did not recognize it as malware.

      "2\tI purchased this as an instant download on Amazon.  The code didn't work.  I had to call the customer service, speak to someone from India about the problem.  She sent me an email with a link to tech support.  The tech support person, instead of giving me another code, took over my computer and entered a code for me... not the code I was given.  Then, since he had control of my computer, he ran the scan for me and changed settings on my computer.  He wanted me to enter the password for my email (I told him no- I didn't want to give him access to my email).  So now the program works on one computer.  I still have two more computers I was planning to install this program onto.  But I won't.  Because I would have to get ahold of tech support and give them access to my other computers.<br /><br />The program also changed settings on my computer that I'm unable to change back.  When I tried to do a system restore- shutting off anti-virus and firewalls- I was unable to.  I tried several times.  It seems my system restore does not work at all anymore.  This program also bogs down my computer- I had just installed a new hard drive a month prior to installing this and I do not have many programs on the computer.  Overall, this program is a waste of time and money.  They have shady tech support and customer service.  I'm not installing this on my other two computers.\n",

      "4\tHonestly, I didn't have very high expectations for this product.  I have tried android apps from this developer and they were pretty weak.  That said, this program delivered what I expected.  It says right on the cover that it is for basic words and phrases.  It isn't fair to judge it harshly by saying it doesn't teach reading or writing.  The software never claimed to be anything more than a launching pad for the language.  For this purpose, it works fine.<br /><br />I travel to Cambodia every year, and I am familiar with the rules of the language.  There are many ways to address people with varying levels of respect.  The complexity of the honorific system in Khmer is much too complex for this basic program.  It also feels like they used the same phrases for all of their language programs, and then tried to fit Khmer phrases in to match.  This isn't always practical, and the result is that some of the phrases are strange.  For example, Khmer people just say &#34;choam reap sua&#34; or &#34;sua sdey&#34; for hello at any time of the day.  The program teaches &#34;good morning, good afternoon, and good evening&#34; - but all of these are very strange to say to a native speaker.  They are not wrong, but they are from a written tradition and very unusual in casual conversation.  I believe that Instant Immersion just teaches these three phrases in all of their programs.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-many words and phrases are useful and practical<br />-male and female voice for every word<br />-motivating progression system<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-lazy execution - not individualized for learning Khmer<br />-some words and phrases are uncommon in the vernacular\n",

But I will give Intuit a little credit - Quicken for Mac 2015 (QM15) is a good step forward from Quicken Essentials for Mac (QEM) but still far behind their Windows counterparts.<br /><br />I have used Quicken for Windows since 2007 (I've used both the Deluxe and Premier versions). However, I have now drank the &quot;Apple-aid&quot; and converted to a MacBook in 2014.<br /><br />I tried QEM in 2014, but was extremely disappointed and frustrated that I did request a refund.<br /><br />However, Intuit made me an excellent officer for QM15, so I tried it.  It was good enough that i used QM15 for about six weeks.  But still, the frustrations and disappointments kept mounting so I reverted back to Q Deluxe for Windows 2013.<br /><br />Here are some of the gaps I noted:<br /><br />Bank account reckons need help.  Transactions that are not entered exactly in the method that the bank downloads them will create new transactions during the import process.  The Windows version will attempt (and does a remarkably good job at) matching the downloaded transactions with previously entered ones.<br /><br />Investments - not being able to select a date to review the portfolio is extremely frustrating - receive a month-end brokerage statement on the 5th day of the month, and was not able to find a method to show the portfolio as of the last day.<br /><br />Reports - very lacking.<br /><br />Loan amortizations - completely missing<br /><br />On the plus side, I do like the drag and drop for transactions - enter a transaction into the incorrect account, and it can be dragged and dropped into the correct account.<br /><br />If Intuit follows their typical course of action, many feature of the Quicken 2013 products will stop working in 2016.  Hopefully their Mac products will be better by then.<br /><br />As of now, Quicken is the only program that I am using my older Windows notebook for (although I am curious to test-drive Windows 10).  So I may have an interesting decision next year as to the course I take with the Quicken Product.\n",

I  tried three different ways to make the image under the various tech instructions and then tried the PCmover.  The data transferred fine, which I could have done easily with a flash drive, but the only programs to transfer and install fully were readily available online programs like Adobe Reader and Google maps.  I have installed and reinstalled other programs, and still after over another month I am still have problems where the programs are unable to access the data.

      "1\tI bought this product at Office Max, and I regret it.<br />I tried to make a simple birthday card, a job that was easy with my old software, but a cumbersome chore with this product.  Instead of giving me an intuitive front, inside left/top, inside right/bottom, and back, it gives 1, 2, 3, 4, and it failed to be consistent where pages 3 and 4 wound up on the page if I tried to leave the back of the card blank.  It wasn't even consistent in where pages 3 and 4 were printed between the print preview and what actually got printed.  As a result, I had to print several draft cards before I got everything in the desired positions, wasting paper, ink, and most importantly, time.  I wish I could return this product.<br /><br />I should also mention that the Undo / Redo for the &#34;page&#34; (1, 2, 3, or 4) gets forgotten as soon as you look at another &#34;page&#34; of your card!

Essentially, your computer grinds to a halt and if you open task manager it shows the Kaspersky app consuming 100%.<br /><br />Likewise, the so called 'automatic' updates seem to be a myth and every time I turn on my PC I'm greeted with &#34;Your databases are extremely out of date&#34; and have to manually update them.<br /><br />I had much higher expectations, and this product did not remotely meet them.

      "1\tIntuit made a big deal about the fact that they were doing rebates and free upgrades. However, there doesn't appear to be any way to get a rebate or free upgrade after April 20, 2015. So those people who bought after that point are screwed.\n",
      "1\tDidn't work for me I removed it within a day.\n",
      "1\tThe old versions of this software were excellent.  I have followed all of my personal finances with Quicken since January of 1992 and swore by the program.  Until this version.  It crashed the first time I loaded it and it clearly wasn't ready for release.  After updating it the first few times it quit crashing.  Starting this month it started dumping out of the program when I download from my bank.  I can't tell you how many times I have had to shut down the program due to hang ups and freezes before during and after downloads.  If you can't download without issue then you need another software.<br /><br />The truth here is that Intuit is so focused on making money off selling your personal information that the software is no longer about following your finances.  The software is about spying on your finances.  It will not download without you being signed in to the Intuit mothership.  It regularly has pop ups, that can't be turned, off to sell you additional items.  At one point the software would no longer download from my bank because it couldn't talk to home and send away my information. This is not a stand alone product, it won't work unless it is allowed to spy on you.<br /><br />I'm running a windows 8 operating system but I don't see that as a factor. As a long time user I can't recommend this product and would tell you to look elsewhere for tracking finances.\n",
      "5\tsimple and easy to use.\n",
      "1\tIf you're going to buy this, be aware that you will receive no useful support if you have a problem.  I set the software to back up every week online, but nothing happened.  What's more, it would not even allow me to back up manually. After waiting for 30 minutes to reach chat support, the tech wanted to remotely access my computer.  (As someone who's designed software, I can assure you this is something you never want to do.  These minimally-trained techs can trash your operating system in a few seconds.)  After about 20 minutes of unsuccessful chat troubleshooting, the tech sent me a link with written instructions, which did not help.  Eventually, I located a support phone number (800-695-0678), but after an hour on hold, I gave up.  I even tried to design a workaround to trick the software into backing up, but after a few minutes it timed out.  Currently reviewing other security software, and by the end of the day I will have uninstalled Norton and moved on.\n",
      "1\tSince installing it for 3.5 months I have had 2 .dll issues.  One Glary fixed, the other one &#34;File not found: VBA6.DLL&#34; needs registry edits and downloads that Microsoft will not allow.  Looks like I'd have to do a complete reinstall of Windows 7 and all programs to fix it.  UUUgh!!!\n",
      "5\tI have been using Norton security for the last 10 years, I was little upset when they changed the format and changed the features. After installing the new version and using it , it's still a great security program. The screen navigation is changed but still very simple to use, they added some security features which are beneficial to fight off some of the latest viruses and malware. What I like about Amazon digital service is that as soon as I paid for the item I can download immediately to my my computers no waiting.\n",
      "1\tI ended up going to an accountant and found that the product really screwed me over - to the tune of about $3000! It simply does not have the right questions if you have any complexity to your finances. If you aren't sure, believe me the extra $130 I ended up paying my tax accountant was well worth the investment!!!\n",

      "5\tCode Work nice and fast, no issues\n",
      "5\tBlock is amazing and gives you the extra back up support you don't receive from competing brands.\n",
      "5\tSo far so good! Great cheap price for PC security. The actually company was charging me $45 for this and I got it for $21.05 on here and it works just the same- No brainer to me; purchase this product instead of buying from the actual website\n",
      "4\tMust have not used it soon enough. I'm getting messages about not having a proper license to use it. Does not seem to be an application any longer. I cannot seem to access it. Who do I need to contact, since I did purchase it.\n",
      "4\tI'm a longtime user of Quicken. Generally speaking, I like it; although not too thrilled with some of the new changes. What I really do not like is that there is no way to get help. You can find some answers on the Community pages, but there are times when you nee to talk to a person. Maybe I should mark them down to three stars!\n",
      "4\tSame old-Same old Quicken! But whattaya gonna do? How many improvements can you make to checkbook processing?<br /><br />It does the job. I buy a new version every few years during a good sale just to stay current. You know, the files get converted!<br /><br />I am quite sure I will keep using it, unless something much better than TurboTax comes out. Data transfers quite well between the products.\n",
      "1\tTotal rip off. Does not work and can't return it.\n",
      "5\tI was skeptical about purchasing software from the Amazon site, however, it was easier and less expensive than purchasing it from Microsoft.  I was very happy with the process and feel confident that my online proof of purchase information is safe with Amazon.  Great experience, easy.\n",
      "5\tVery easy to use. The software has a great help feature. I would recommend this product to anyone with a small business.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\tTried to switch from Windows version to this one and this is unusable. Maybe if you've never used Quicken this MIGHT be mediocre, but compared to the Windows version it is a disaster. I have actually kept an old Windows laptop around just so I can use the Windows version of Quicken, the Mac version is that bad.\n",
      "5\tWorked as promised!\n",
      "4\tThis will identify and get rid of malware that your computer already has. Have done two scans in a months time and it has found and eliminated some malware.  Would love it if it could find and repair all the issues on my computer.\n",
      "5\tRecently my main production PC broke, and I had to replace it. My disks were intact.<br />The same day I got a mail with info about PCmover. After reading the spec.,<br />I bought the program, and installed it in the new computer.<br />Old system disk connected  via USB. The program worked for a couple<br />of hours, analyzing every aspect of the old system and the copied everything<br />exept the OS. Everything was completely restored even some programs that<br />are hard to install.<br />Two years ago I spent a lot time moving three systems from XP to W7.<br />That was a nightmare. PCmover is worth every cent it costs.<br />I strongy recommend it when upgrading, as it also is able to<br />move from XP to a later system.\n",
      "1\twill not download either\n",
      "5\tIt works perfectly, thanks!\n",
      "4\tworks great and for free!\n",

      "5\tWarning - the only problem I had is that Amazon sells a version which will not on windows 8 and I have windows 8. As noted in other reviews, I called Nuance tech support for Omnipage and they sent me a link to download the correct version. And I am very happy Omnipage. I bought a scanner which came with Omnipage 4 SE. Of all the OCRs I have used, Omnipage performs the best. So now that I have upgraded my computer and scanner, I purchased Omnipage 18 from amazon. So just for the fun of it, I scanned two very complex documents together, sideways. Omnipage read them and yielded an almost perfect text document of each page.  The only problem that I found was that the page numbers of the documents were not perfectly centered. Other that that, it was perfect.<br /><br />The speed of conversion was fast. I have a laptop made to work very fast. Some software can slow my computer to a crawl. But with Omnipage, it takes less than one second to convert a page. I am impressed.<br /><br />Since Omnipage sells for $149 on other sites, even if you have windows 8, I would buy the software from Amazon and have Nuance update it. And don't worry, the techs at Nuance receive many calls regarding amazon and know what to do.\n",
      "5\tH&R Block Premium is a great program and comes with the standard guarantee that they will help you should you get audited. Much better program than the competing product.\n",
      "5\tStill Loving being PROTECTED!!  At a REALLY GOOD PRICE!!  THANK YOU!!\n",
      "1\tFirst off, let me say I love the software itself. But please, PLEASE AVOID THE DOWNLOAD OPTION. I have had one technological nightmare after another this week and Magix Customer Service Dept is a joke. I bought a new computer a few weeks ago that turned out to have a faulty motherboard so I had to get that all replaced, but my original Magix disc was trapped in the new computer that wouldnt turn on after one initial shutdown /reboot.  I use this software as my main editing program for my Youtube channel so I needed a replacement ASAP. Decided to go with the digital download for convenience but joke was on me I guess. The digitial version appeared to be missing options -- some of them ones I use the most, such as captions. I searched online on tech forums trying to find the solution, everyone was saying &#34;Oh, just go to Help menu and click on Free Download option&#34;. I go in my program, look under Help menu -- no such option listed. I email Magix, tell them the situation to which they send back an email which clearly showed me my request for help was only casually scanned because I got the &#34;Go to your Help menu, click Free Download..&#34; after I specifically said in MY email that that option does not appear to exist. They send me a screenshot of what I'm supposed to see, I send them one back of what my menu looks like. THEN I get an email basically saying &#34;Looks like the file is corrupt, please take off, do a registry clean and reload program -- but keep in mind this could severely mess up Windows and we're not responsible for any damages&#34;. Then they make it impossible to find out how to get a refund on the purchase. So crushed at the money I wasted on this -- could not have happened at a worse time. Like I said, the program itself is very good but PLEASE order the physical copy, save yourself the headache I'm going through.\n",
      "5\tMalwarebytes is awesome and very good at it's job. Worth buying a lifetime premium subscription.\n",
      "4\tTurboTax worked just as it should overall. BUT you shouldn't need this version to simply do a Schedule C. But that's not Amazon's problem, that's TurboTax's problem. Many have complained that TT removed features from the deluxe version and that is true.<br />After the taxes were done, IRS adjusted the return. Not sure why. And I didn't get my Amazon card because the IRS adjusted my return.\n",
      "5\tThis is really wonderful software for basic photo editing software.\n",
      "1\tThis is not a review of the software but of the digital download ability of amazon.<br /><br />Basically it wouldn't work.  I got a refund but its disappointing this day and age when they cant make a download work.\n",
      "3\tNot a lot of options out there for macbook Blu ray player. So I have nothing to compare it to. but as a bluray player it sucks. It hangs from time to time and gives jittery playback.<br />Giving it 3 star only due to amazon pricing. for $30 its alright.\n",

      "4\tI upgrade each year.  While some features are improved, it is so minor (and some things work worse) that I honestly do not know why I continue to upgrade each time they come out with a new package.  I guess I am just afraid it will stop working with my bank or credit card if I do not (which I did have happen in the past).<br /><br />If you are looking for a home (or small business) package, then this is it.  I have tried a few others, but have always come back to Quicken (I have been using Quicken since 1991).  It is the best and most reliable I have used.<br /><br />If you are upgrading from 2014, it probably is not worth it (but being the loyal customer I continue to purchase each version as they release).\n",
      "1\tI work as a Physical Therapist Assistant.  Physical therapist and physical therapist assistant have been listed on many top 10 fastest growing jobs for the last five years.  I was extremely disappointed to find that neither of the these professions were among the &#34;1250 sample resumes&#34; that are advertised.  I did find one for an occupational therapist and thought I could at least get some ideas from that, but it was an occupational therapist that seemed to be applying for a sales rep job????  This was a waste of money.\n",
      "5\tI'm a CPA and I have about 80% of my business clients now using Xero.  I believe it to be better all around than other accounting solutions out there.  It has some limitations in terms of reporting, but with integrated payroll included, I don't know of anything better.\n",

      "2\tThe disaster that was Intuit's removing full Schedule C from Deluxe re-emerges.  There is no free upgrade anymore.  I was told that, despite Vice President Bob's communications, that the upgrade offer was terminated on April 20.<br /><br />The worst part is that nowhere could you find this information.  Some places said yes, some said no, I went with Bob's letter.  Nothing about an expiry date on the upgrade offer.<br /><br />I'll work around it for now, but I'm not giving Intuit another dime, ever.<br /><br />For the cost to them of essentially nothing, they lose a customer of at least 20 years.  Hell of a marketing team.\n",
      "1\tThere was an error in my order.  I wanted to order the 2012 edition of the Turbo Tax Deluxe and downloaded it.  It was exactly what I wanted and provided the information that I needed.  The problem was with the billing that I received for both the 2102 version and the 2014 version.  I did not download the 2014 as I purchased that version locally from COSCO when I filled out my 2104 tax return.  If the 2014 was ordered it was an error on my part and was not downloaded and therefore not used.<br />I would appreciate your removal of the billing for the 2014 version and bill me only for the 2012 version.<br /><br />Thank You Very Much,<br /><br />Monte Allred<br />mallred@sbcglobal.net\n",

      "2\tThat's right. NO. THREE. POINT. EDIT. The most fundamental building block of NLE (or even for the old tape to tape days) is not a part of this &#34;powerful&#34; video editor. Who designed this? Who decided that inpoint and outpoint were no longer a part of editing? Shame on me for just assuming that a three point edit would be part of the process in this program. SHAME ON CYBERLINK for making an editor without it.<br />So why two stars? Why not just one star? Because it does edit. It does export in a variety of great and useful formats. It is not a memory hog (compared to Media Composer or Premiere) and it does offer a number of bells and whistles. Adding clips to the timeline is easy, adding transitions is easy, moving clips around the timeline is easy. Making titles and subtitles is easy. Its so freaking easy to use this software, but it will take you FOREVER to make precise edits on your timeline. Essentially you drop the WHOLE CLIP into the timeline and remove what you DONT want!!! Talk about backwards.<br />Here is what is horrible:<br />Left key and right key do not move the cursor in the timeline. It is a combination of keys to simply move the cursor. FIX PLEASE<br />There is only a Preview window. No option for preview next to timeline, so no side-by-side comparison of coloring between shots<br />Basic audio editing like rubber banding has to be done in a different &#34;room&#34; not on the timeline<br />Oh, yeah, and there is no three point edit. Are you kidding me?<br /><br />Who this is probably for:<br />Skateboarders who want to set their trick videos to music (tons of options for that stuff)<br />Parents who just want to pare down the ton of video they shot at the birthday party<br />Anyone who has more time than they can handle to assemble accurate clips<br />Absolute beginners who just want to physically manipulate the video and not think about how one clip relates to the next<br />Anyone who doesn't need to sequence, doesnt match on action, doesntmatch audio to video, or doesnt shoot long clips<br /><br />Who should avoid this:<br />Anyone with experience in editing. Especially if you think in terms of three point edits.<br />Anyone who shoots a bunch of their b-roll in one clip (I cant even imagine that nightmare)<br />Anyone who doesnt have time to unlearn what they already know about editing<br />Anyone who likes to work quickly and effeciently<br />Anyone who needs to sequence<br /><br />I am so sorry that I actually bought this software. There is a free trial. I should have tried it. What was I thinking? Now I am $70 lighter (thank goodness for the sale price) and there is no way to get a refund. I am stuck with this headache inducing piece of junk that makes editing so much harder than it needs to be.<br /><br />Dear Cyberlink,<br />Your interface is pretty, your workflow isnt half bad, your icons make sense and the screen isnt cluttered. You made so many aspects of editing easier than the other guys. But you ruined step one. WHY?<br /><br />Will you give me a refund? I doubt it.\n",

Not only can I add my personal recipes but this version will recommend popular recipe downloads and search the internet for recipes for me and then allow me to automatically save them in the program. After a computer operating system upgrade my Cook'n program wasn't working correctly so I emailed the company and got a response within several hours that included an apology for my problem, clear instructions and a link for a new download along with a personal comment to let their representative know if I had any other problems. I have used computers for many years and have never enjoyed the level of customer service I have experienced with Cook'n. I have contacted them in the past with questions and have always received a personal response. I highly recommend Cook'n not only for the quality and capability of the program but also for the amazing customer support. And, did I mention that my recipes automatically sync across my computer, iPad and iPhone so even if I am out I can check a recipe to see if I need to pick something up from the store!

What a monumental let down to find out that this version dropped all stop motion features.  Is the Chroma key the next feature to be dropped? I hope I'm in time to stop my district from upgrading since this is one of the 4 multimedia projects in video storytelling. There is no option to contact Adobe for a resolution. I would appreciate a refund please.<br />If you only need regular video editing this will be great. You won't have any features that make you pay more for if you actually want to use them. There is still a bit of effort needed to navigate and learn the software but well worth the effort. YouTube and Adobe TV have tutorials for every step. It really is a decent introductory level video editor with the additional benefit of also having pretty advanced features when you are ready.\n",

Norton then improved for a couple years, but they seem to be getting worse and worse.  I uninstalled from both my android devices as they were both running intolerably slow.  Slow screen response to slow software activation.  Keep in mind both my phone and tablet are the premium Samsung devices on the market, and now run like it again.<br />The bloatware within the Chrome browser also was beyond a problem in Windows OS.

      "5\tAs a busy, multi-business operator, I find the convenience of operating in the cloud indispensable. I currently use Xero in 2 businesses, with multiple partners, in multiple states. We can each complete our individual tasks (invoicing, billing, reporting) and at the end of the quarter or year, turn the whole thing over to our CPA. We just implemented ZenPayroll as an add-on, it makes payroll a breeze. While not all banks sync with Xero, the option is a great time-saver. If you are currently using Square for your merchant account, the transactions, inventory and customers can flow in, minimizing duplication of effort. The customer service we've received from Kahuna has been incredible. If there were 6 stars, we would selected that for our review... Not only do I tell all of my small-business owner friends, I recommend Xero whenever I can.\n",

But once I purchased the standalone version, the dehaze function disappeared! Apparently it is not available in the standalone version. So to me it almost, almost felt like a bait and switch. A very unpleasant feeling and I lost trust in Adobe.<br /><br />Sure, they will argue that you purchased the standalone version, you can't keep having upgrades (think software long ago). I don't dispute that, but at least be upfront about it in a very clear manner. At least here I present you my experience just to keep you informed. Hope it helps. If I were mistaken, I hope someone from Adobe can right this. So far, I'm a very very disappointed customer!\n",
      "2\tNot worth it. I thought this might be easier than re-installing all the applications one by one, but in the end, PCmover seemed to mess up with the Windows startup files, I ended up resetting the new PC to factory default and starting over after a couple of hours of effort. I had high hopes for this product to work, but now I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone. 24-7 customer support appeared to be overseas and sleazy.<br /><br />Background: After having had a PC's SSD fail (data was backed up), we were only trying to take a system image of a Windows 7 laptop (not having issues), put that on an external drive, and transfer it to a new Windows 8.1 machine. As the laptop was not particularly having issues, everything should have gone smoothly according to the PDF documentation on the developer's website. After the 1st migration, the brand new machine indicated trouble at Windows startup, and attempted to repair itself but couldn't. The only thing I could do to start Windows was to either 'refresh' (keep the files but undo the changes in applications) or 'reset' (bring the machine back to factory settings). I did the 'refresh' in order to start Windows, but that beat the purpose of this software by wiping all the apps. (The ones I chose for transfer were all supposedly compatible with the new OS.)<br /><br />Thinking that may have been because I tried migrating multiple drives/partitions at once (although the company gives precise instructions how to do so, which I followed to the letter), I gave it a second go, this time just choosing the old main C:\\ drive with applications (mounted VHD). Same problem - after finishing the process, Windows 8.1 wouldn't start.<br /><br />At one point I contacted the tech support phone number. From the name of the rep & accent I'd guess it's answered in India. Which I wouldn't mind, if the service is courteous and competent. The rep was convinced the old PC (the one migrating the image from) was the issue, although I tried to tell himwe took the image from the machine that wasn't having issues. He insisted I should install a 'small piece of software' for him to diagnose the problem. This was my husband's laptop, and he had many windows open (he's a game developer), so I didn't want to close the programs to run the diagnostics as he was gone at the time. So I didn't go through the entire process, but that was also partially because I was a bit taken aback when the rep kept asking me, &#34;Are you Asian?&#34; after I gave him my name. At first I didn't answer since that wasn't relevant to my inquiry, but he repeated the question (as if that should make us buddies??). It was strange to be asked such things in a tech support call, and as I wasn't able to tell what he could do with the system info sharing software, I hung up.<br /><br />Afterward, I reset the new PC to factory setting, because I didn't want to mess up the boot record/wanted a clean start, and just used Windows Easy Transfer (built-in, free) to transfer the files only. Then installed all the applications myself. The failed PCmover process took 2-3 hours of my time and only broke the Windows startup; it may have taken slightly longer to re-do it with Windows Easy Transfer, but it didn't introduce any startup error in the new PC, so that felt much better.<br /><br />Maybe if you have a simple, one-drive (image)-to-another-drive migration with most common productivity software, this might work. I wouldn't try mounting multiple disk images. The software said the process was success, but I had to undo everything (which I wasn't even given an option to 'undo' through the application, like the documentation says it should). So I feel like I just threw away $43 (price + tax).<br /><br />[Edit: The good people of Amazon made it right, when I contacted & explained the software corrupted a brand new PC's startup files. So I got the money back - thank you. Hence 1 star for the product, +1 star for Amazon customer service (not the manufacturer).]\n",

And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.<br /><br />Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered.<br /><br />Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.<br /><br />Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it wouldn't uninstall.<br /><br />When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads.<br />Your computer, your choice.<br />Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible.<br />Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?

That being said (and counter-intuitive in that I switched to a Mac), the half-baked version they developed for Mac does not even support Quicken's own bill pay service! I might as well keep my transactions and billing details in Excel, then pay through my bank. I have heard rumors that this is in the works, but my experience with Intuit tells me that it would be years away if at all. I cannot get my ~$75 back, yet I plan to dump this in lieu of Mint or some other solution. The Mac version is a total failure in that if you value the convenience of keeping track of and paying your bills through one interface, you need to keep looking.

I purchased the Photography Plan during the Prime Day promotion, downloaded the installers, and went to work. I am still using my old version of Photoshop CS3, and I was excited to try out all the new bells and whistles.<br /><br />Two days later, after spending 5+ hours in chat with Adobe Support, I am cancelling my subscription, running every cleaning tool I can find to get rid of all the Adobe folders that have added gigs and gigs of useless crap to my Common Files folders, and doing a system restore back to before I ever started this nightmare.<br /><br />The applications installed, but with errors.  No error messages, but they wouldn't launch, or crashed. They uninstalled, but left so many settings and keys behind, my computer started behaving oddly.  Photoshop would crash every time I saved and exited an image file.  Adobe support ran three different cleaning tools during my sessions with them, and they still couldn't uninstall and reinstall Photoshop and Lightroom properly.  The fact that they were clearly following a script (run tool, set up alternate admin account, disable antivirus and firewall, change permissions on application folders, then give up) didn't help at all.  I was told a &#34;system specialist&#34; would contact me, but I have not heard a thing from them after ending the support session. I can't be too hard on them, though, because this software is so poorly written and so badly coded, it's beyond a nightmare to work with.  My computer is running sluggishly and many system settings have been changed by the Adobe installs (I'm running Windows 7x64, and my laptop is way over-spec'd for this software).  The bloat in my user profile alone is inexcusable.<br /><br />Photoshop is by far the best image software out there right now, and I love working with it.  As soon as it is released on disk again, I'll be purchasing a new copy. But the Creative Cloud model is poorly thought out and poorly executed, and I'm extremely disappointed by this whole experience. I've lost 8+ hours of time to this awful application package.

      "5\tI'm a hobbyist woodworker with a large format CNC Router.  I've been looking for a capable CAD/CAM software package that I can legally use at home.  I have used Inventor for years and had a student license when I was in school.  However, now that I am a working stiff, I can't honestly use that student license anymore.  I spent months looking for software that I could reasonably afford that wouldn't cost me as much as my cnc machine to use.  I found it in Fusion 360.  Fusion 360 is a new kind of software platform for Autodesk.  Rather than a pricey up-front cost strategy, they are offering several subscription services ranging from free to (currently) $40/mo or $300/year.  The free license is available to hobbyists and &#34;start ups&#34; which means you can use the software for free as long as you aren't making a profit with it.  If you do end up developing a product for sale, you can roll into the $40/mo or $300/year subscription which is quite affordable even for the adventurous hobbyist like myself.  As far as the software is concerned, It is really quite good especially if you consider the price.  It is not as convenient to use as something like Inventor.  It lacks hot keys and other powerful features like parts libraries.  It also has a bit different kind of assembly methodology using &#34;joints&#34; rather than constraints.  A joint is basically an automated way of doing 3 constraints at once which can be convenient, but can be frustrating as well when you want to do more complex constraints.  That said, it is an EXCEEDINGLY powerful software package.  There is nothing better in the CAD market for under $2-3K for the cad capabilities and absolutely nothing like it for under $4-8K on the CAM side.  It is a fully parametric, fully direct modeling, and fully T-Spline sculpting CAM package with assembly capabilities as well as a model based integrated CAM system.  Further, it is a product that is growing in capability all the time.  It may not be the perfect software for enterprise level work yet, but for the hobbyist and small shop, its more than enough especially at the price level of free.  I do a lot of woodworking and this software is great for making technical and sculpted parts.  However, there are certain things I wish it did that I have been told are coming:  1) V-carving... This is nice for making lettering and signs.  You can do embossing, but making really good letters is not easy at the moment.  2) Part patterning/nesting... when you cut stuff out of sheet stock you really want to make the most of your materials.  Right now, there is not an easy way to even pattern parts with the same CAM operations.  If you need multiple parts, you either have to create a specialized gcode program with work offsets yourself or machine them one at a time.  3) Feeds and speeds calculator... You need this to keep from breaking or burning up your bits.  Right now I use G-Wizzard by CNC Cookbook.  It would save time if Fusion would do an even basic calculation to set these for you.  Because of these short comings, this software is not ideal for CNC routers, but I've been told that these things are coming so maybe I will revise my review to be a full 5 star review when these features are complete because then I would need no other software to do what ever I want.  **** UPDATE **** This morning I got an update of the software.  There is now a CAM Patterning ability.  Maybe it was there before and I didn't notice it, but I just found it this morning.  That is a BIG plus.  I have upgraded my review to 4.5 stars.  I can live without a feeds and speeds calculator as I have one already, but being able to pattern parts in sheet goods is HUGE.  I hope they do a nesting feature too.  If only they did v-carving, I would be super happy.  If they had a sculpting library available for relief carving I would be EXTATIC.  Maybe this is coming too.\n",

      "1\tVery disappointed. I always file under extension so I bought Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe in July. I used Deluxe 2013 for last year and none of my circumstances have changed materially. Well, running 2014 Deluxe I discovered that I was solicited to pay $30 in order to upgrade to Premiere, because Deluxe no longer supports entering S corp K-1 schedule info for Schedule E. Yet I read in various posts here that Intuit had acknowledged their &#34;mistake&#34; and provided free upgrades for Deluxe customers in my situation. Well it turns out the free upgrade was only if you filed your return by April 30, 2015. The irony is TT reps have stated here that they will have this &#34;fixed&#34; for 2015 returns, which means that for some reason the only customers &#34;burned&#34; by this are those who bought their TT Deluxe in good faith in order to file their 2014 returns on extension. WHY should WE be penalized?! I paid the $30 begrudgingly, because I had done most of the work and wasn't included to start all over with H&R Block software. As far as I am concerned if a tax software is going to drop a major component of what they cover, it's obligated to make this clear in its marketing both in online descriptions and on the box itself. Nowhere does it indicate that Sch K-1 coverage has been dropped.<br /><br />The software seems to work fine, as it did last year.

I would prefer a simple subscription and only upgrade when there is a good reason. The last few versions I've installed seem to get worse with each version. They must have learned from Microsoft! But the 2015 version is the worst yet! The installation was anything but smooth. I had to restart it twice. Since then there have been several updates, some of which corrupted everything and I had to reinstall. With each update I hope the bugs I have been fighting have been fixed, but they haven't. Here is a list of the most annoying bugs:<br />* When entering a payee in a register the auto-complete box covers the field, so if it is a new entry I have to type blind until I hit enter.<br />* Occasionally CTRL/B doesn't start the backup and I have to dig through the menus to find where to initiate the backup.<br />* When selecting a category, the auto-complete doesn't let me hit the down arrow to navigate to a sub-category. The same is true of check numbers.<br />* The enter key doesn't move to the next field when filling in the opening dialog for reconciling an account. It does in other places in the program.<br />* The remembering of payees is erratic, sometimes it remembers, sometimes it doesn't.<br />* I have dual screens on my computer, but they have different resolutions. When I move quicken to the larger screen and make it full screen the panes get messed up and I can't see most of them. Reducing the size allows it to fill the panes correctly.<br />* When second screen is disconnected and I open Quicken, it tries to put it on the disconnected screen and I can't get it back. A real problem when I take my laptop with me on the road!<br /><br />Come on Intuit! Let's do some testing before you release new versions. At the very least the stuff that used to work should continue to work. And please fix the constant hanging! I'm notsure which is worse, Quicken 2015 or Windows 8.1!\n",

If you take someone like me that used Illustrator only somewhat regularly, often skipping a month or two without using it at all, this is simply going to force me out.  Let's say I need it for a project that takes 3 hours.  And that's all I use it for in a 6-month period.  I'm paying Adobe $180 to &#34;rent&#34; their software for that one project.  I suppose I could go through the hassle of stopping and starting the subscription every time I open it up or decide I don't need it for a while... but then if I need to pop it open again a week later, I have to pay the $30 again.  Of course I'm not going to do that, so... yeah, basically when my old version of Illustrator ceases to function next time I upgrade a computer or an OS, I'm just out.  Very sad.  I've loved Illustrator over the last 15+ years of working with it.\n",

Made the purchase right before leaving home, came back 5 hours later and my Adobe CC software had already registered the subscription and all features were again unlocked.  Excellent.

When I started using this payroll in 2010, the fee was $299. So this is a 74% increase in 5 years. That's about 12% per year.

I have found their support staff excellent have always responded to my questions and all problems have been resolved in a timely manner.

For reference I'm running a windows 8.1 machine with 18GB of ram, and plenty of processing power. There wasn't even an error. The installer simply said that the 'installer was interrupted... no modifications have been made to your system'.  Which is an incredibly unhelpful message, especially when it appear below the INSTALLER COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY part, which normally means that the installer worked.  Now I did manage to get it installed, and it's a really stupid trick. I had to be an admin. As a regular user, even using the admin password, even using Run As Admin, it would not install.  Once I switched my user account to admin, it installed (though I did have to reboot once in the middle of the installation, per the prompt which instructs you to do so, but uses the ever so vague &#34;unless you've rebooted multiple times&#34; qualifier).  I haven't had a chance to try the software itself out yet. I'm hoping that since I've gotten it installed I can switch back to the safety of being a regular user without it breaking. I'll update this review as I go along, but for now I'm leaving it at 3 stars. A painful installation, but a successful one.   *EDIT Forget successful. While it technically installed, the program won't even open. As soon as I try to start it the typical &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows has stopped working&#34; message appears.

The reason why Free is NEVER FREE...  ***FAST FOWARD***.... And once I have it installed on my computer. Went to the AVAST page on how to OPT OUT OF DATA COLLECTION .... Guess what it is not letting me opt out.  I called the AVAST PHONE NUMBER talked to somebody in their &#34;TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT&#34;  NAMED JOE in San Jose.. He gave me his agent number which he probably made up. # 1172  I told him that my computer wasn't allowing me to optout of the data sharing. He said he didn't understand what I was saying. I was now PISSED OFF and I repeated the EXACT SAME THING. All of a sudden now he understands what I am referring to. ..He said that even though he is in their technical department he can not help me... He claimed that there were no supervisors for me to speak to. He told me he would have to report this to their &#34;engineers&#34;.. and that for me to get this resolved  I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM..  THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO PAY TO UPGRADE TO OPT OUT OF THE DATA SHARING... WHAT COMPLETE GARBAGE ...  ... And here is the report I am sending to the BBB...&#62;&#62;  I downloaded Avast Virus protection from Amazon.com  I had to read and sign off on the AVAST PRIVACY Disclosure statement that said I could opt out of their data sharing program.   Once the AVAST program was installed on my computer it started operating BEFORE I WAS OFFERED to option of OPTING out of data collection.    I was reading the directions on how to OPT OUT of their data collection program. My system wasn't letting me opt out. So I called their support phone number  I called AVAST  1-866-951-7679  https://www.avast.com/en-us/support  I spoke to a rep who said he was in their technical assistance program. He said his name was Joe and I asked for his Agent ID number which he was hesitant to give to me. AGENT # 1172 is what he said. He told me he is in SAN JOSE.   He told me that he didn't know what I was talking about. Once I got upset he then told me he knew what I was talking about but he couldn't do anything to assist me. He said that I would have to PAY FOR UPGRADED SERVICE TO OPT out of their data collection program. I asked for a supervisor. He told me that I could not speak to a supervisor.

Over the years I did wonder if there was something better, and I did download a number of trial run subscriptions.  None of them were as good as my old software, COOKBOOK.  Two years ago along came a new computer and my old DOS program would no longer work.  I was forced to find something else as I was tired getting that old computer out every time I wanted a recipe!  That is when I found Cook’n!  I watched Dan’s demo video and said to myself “this is the one!”  It is the only one I reviewed where I could easily get all 300+ recipes from my old software into the new.  Using the “snip it” tool made it very easy!  This software does so much and I have not even touched on some of the things it will do.  I love it that when I see a recipe online that I would like to  have, all I need to do is have Cook’n open and enter the name and I can “capture” it right into my software.  I have had some issues that were easily resolved by the great support staff.  They try to respond quickly and I have not had to wait long.  I love using the computer and I have enjoyed the fact that you can do so much with this software.  I highly recommend it!\n",

      "1\tThe program is EXCELLENT, but the CC program pricing is where it falls apart.  While the other programs are fine under the CC deal, the cost for the DW only option, or lack of ability to choose a package even, is where they fail -- miserably. I love you Adobe, but you have let this LONG time buyer down greatly.  The Pricing Model for &#34; Forced Leasing&#34; is not appropriately priced.   For anyone who is looking for an amazing Website Tool and can afford the monthly fee, this IS IT. But the complaints that you see here, are toward the pricing model, not toward the program necessarily. Long time users have fallen away from Adobe due to this. I have proudly purchased Adobe products, since 2.0,  I have spent thousands of dollars investing into Adobe products for over 20 years, because they are excellent, no one does them better. However, this model of &#34;leasing&#34; the program, is killing not only long time users, but new.   There are many people who can not afford this level of investment every month just to &#34;keep it new&#34;, most casual users will use older versions of a program for a while, till they can save up for the newer versions, with this model, it makes it impossible to even do that. Sadly, Adobe is forcing this leasing model on individuals who truly need this program, and who are not making money with it, but will never be able to buy it at this rate.   Yes, I totally understand they are doing it to prevent the pirated copies out there, I get that. I know they had to do something... But there must be some other way, instead of writing off a huge market . I need this program, but i can't do the price, so I do without. I am sad, so very very sad for Adobe having to make this drastic and loyal customer killing move.\n",

      "1\tI mostly have negative comments about word 2010 to 2013 upgrade: * Table width is now constrained by the document margins, which means that users cannot change the format of their old documents without dramatically altering their layout. Why not giving users a choice? I do not see why this is so complicated... * The neat draft mode and plan mode icons disappeared from the status bar. Why removing a handy feature? That does not make sense! * It's no longer possible to show/hide the ruler with a mouse click. Another neat feature gone for no reason * Cumbersome spellcheck compared to that of 2010 * The navigation button below the right scroll bar disappeared (the one that was similar to F5, but with more features) - Why? * Messed up text boundaries that can no longer be shown without getting annoying lines across the entire document * Modifying the ribbon requires awkward manipulations * Handy features disappeared form the right click menus (e.g. update style) and they cannot be modified as in earlier versions of Word * Silence of the Office team despite bitter remark from users on various fora. This place seems to be an exception, that's good. As far I am concerned, I made up my mind. I'll stick to Word 2010, but I am afraid I won't be given much choice with the new versions of Windows. This 2013 release and the way criticism is handled gives me the feeling that Microsoft is moving further away from a customer centric culture to a developers culture, where techies know better than the users what they need and what's good for them.\n",

      "4\tI was hesitant to buy Dragon Dictate after checking out the reviews, but now that I've been working with it for a week I'm very glad I took the risk. Yes, the program was very frustrating for the first few days while I &#34;trained&#34; it to recognize my voice, but the accuracy improved every day and now I would guess that it's about 90-95% accurate, which is perfectly acceptable for what I use it for. I have found that my Mac's built in mic doesn't do so well with the dictation portion of the program so I would recommend checking into a mic upgrade if this is what you'll be using Dragon for. I dictate into a handheld recorder (Olympus brand) and then use the transcription function to get my words on the screen, and this is proving to be a huge time save for me now that I've struggled through the initial training process. My advice, don't get frustrated. Give yourself a week or two of working with the program before you decide to kick it to the curb. I don't think Dragon is for everyone, but for those people who have the patience to stick with it, the program can be a really valuable tool.\n",

Avast Technical Support says that the problem is with Windows, not Avast, and they refuse to help me unless I pay them.  The crash is inside Avast's updated module ngvss.sys, and Windows has been stable on my system for more than four years, that is until this new version was installed.  It looks like I have no choice but to uninstall Avast, permanently, and switch to a competing product, Panda Free Antivirus.\n",

      "1\tI have been a religious Quicken user since the early 90s.  I have gone through numerous upgrades over the years and have experienced any of the problems that I've seen mentioned in the user reviews over the years.  However, with the 2015 version, that story is very different.  I upgraded a couple months ago due to the 3-year rule that Intuit has in place now for online services.  I was very happy with Quicken 2012 and would have stayed with it, but I was forced to upgrade.  The first problem I had was the file corruption/password lockout issue that Intuit has since released a patch to address.  I had that problem right after I upgraded.  After I fixed it, Quicken worked fine until this week when it decided that it wasn't going to show me downloaded transactions for my checking account anymore..  It shows that they have been downloaded in the one step update summary, but they are nowhere to be found.  I have about 6-7 accounts that I download transactions for, but this is the only one having the problem.<br /><br />I've spent a couple of hours trying to figure it out and Google the problem.  I see others have reported similar problems, but I don't see a fix.  I guess I'm going to open up a ticket with Intuit tomorrow.  Needless to say, I'm very unhappy with this version so far and Intuit's overall strategy to force people to upgrade to versions that they don't need.  I wish there was still a decent competitor like Microsoft Money to keep Intuit honest.  And I wish Intuit would make a Mac version that was as good as the Windows versions have been.  I hate having to fire up a Windows machine just to balance the books.  Oh well... Maybe some day.\n",

      "2\tI am a expert user of Autodesk inventor and almost all other Autodesk products.  When this product came out our company purchased the ultimate edition.  In short I feel as if I am being forced to pay for beta testing of this product. And maybe this is because I come from the Inventor side of things where the product is very usable.  Fusion seems as if it is a product that needs to mature before it is usable in a engineering production type scenario. The user interface is very lacking and hard to navigate when compared to Autodesk Inventor and any other parametric software The video rendering has issues when being used with Hybrid graphics cards It has Zero integration with other Autodesk desktop software Importing and exporting native Inventor files is not easy and requires multiple steps. You need internet access to view and edit existing files.  No offline option (local copy) that I know of for current cloud based files.

      "1\tI decided to try this after a miserable failure with Windows version of home and business and Wells Fargo Bank last year.  The reviews seemed better than I’d read in a long time for the OS X version so, after trying iBank, thought I’d give it a try.  Also, most bad reviews are based on this not looking/working like quicken for Windows.    Here is what I've learned:  1. When you set it up, be very carful of account type.  It’s best guess with (Wells Fargo) is frequently wrong, eg credit card accounts being identified as checking accounts.  The only way to fix this is to delete the account and start over. 2. Adding old QIF files have to be converted to QFX files if you’ve started with downloads from your bank.  This is easily done with a utility from Money Tumb.  It costs 34 bucks, but is well worth it.  The rub is there are times when the downloaded transactions disappear.  I needed this as I started with a bank download and had to back fill transactions.  If you start out with QIF files and then download you may be able to avoid the backfill and cost for Money Thumb. 3. Renaming an investment account after downloading may cause it to disappear, but the data and balances are there.  After nearly an hour in chat with quicken support, I tried hiding it in the list where you can do that, (you could see it there) and un-hiding it.  That caused it to reappear.  This is what I mean by buggy.  Put you beta testing hat on where you use this software and back up frequently.  After adding accounts, look closely at the preceding account set ups to make sure nothing is scrambled. Overall this version works better with Wells Fargo than my last Windows Home and Business running in Parallels, and better than iBank.  It does look quite workable after the initial bumps. Updated review down to 1 star.  Downloads with Wells Fargo have stopped working.  It's unbelievable how unstable this software is after all these years.  The usual advice and something you have to do all too frequently (disconnect and reconnect accounts for download) no longer works.  If you look, this problem has come up repeatedly over the years.  Unbelievable.\n",

However, after all my purchased software reverted to trial software that I cannot use, now I know that the software is subpar.   I am really regretting that I purchased Creative Cloud.  The first mistake was day one, I somehow ended up with a prepaid one year membership.  The last I ever want to do is prepay a corporation for a subscription service.  Because, when they don't provide the service as advertised, guess what, they don't offer any refunds for the lack of service.   The larger cultural issue is how corporations in general give such lousy customer service.  Once they have your money they really will do everything possible to hold onto it regardless of whether they are right or wrong.  (One exception is Amazon, kudos for their convenient return policy.)   So right now I have an unusable subscription that I have to put my time and effort into fixing myself.\n",

I only purchased this because Intuit intentionally discontinued support for downloading transactions in order to coerce people into giving them more money for a lower quality product than they already had.<br /><br />I would buy this again, only because there is no competition right now.

I bought the previous version of LT from Autodesk, downloaded it on my laptop, used it for a few months and then my laptop was stolen.  After getting a new computer I made several efforts to contact Autodesk and reinstall AutoCAD on my new laptop.  It was nearly impossible to get someone to speak with me.  If you're a small business or individual assume that you will never (ever) speak to Autodesk without paying for it through some sort of support agreement.  When I finally did get someone to &#34;help&#34; me she provided me with a link to download AutoCAD, which turned out to download the trial version, and would require me to pay the entire value again.  Now I need AutoCAD for another project and here I am having to buy it.  Again.  My advice is to ALWAYS BUT AUTOCAD IN A BOX.

I could see really no improvement from the previous version.  The previous version of this product also doesn't work properly with Vanguard if spouses have Vanguard retirement accounts with the same employer.  The problem was still in this version of Quicken.  Vanguard gave me a workaround but it is tricky to do.<br />What is really, really bad now is that release 7 of this product had a bug in it.  The bug messed up the password and you could not open your data file.  Release 8 was issued on May 23, but Intuit did not push this out to their users.  Today, July 14, I was unable to open the file that I had spent many hours doing updates to the previous date.  Intuit had me upload the file for password removal, but then I received an email saying they couldn't repair the file.  So, I've lost a lot of time as I spent time today working with the customer support.  I do have the backup from last week, but not worth the time to redo - time will be spent on an alternative.<br />Don't buy this product!!!

      "5\tMcAfee LiveSafe is a protection suite that I have been very happy with over the last year.  I had a trial for it that came with my new computer last year and I like it enough to subscribe for a year.  Well.. it's renewal time coming up and you can either get price gouged by McAfee via auto-renewal (where they charge you full retail), or you could turn off auto-renewal and order and apply a new one year sub at a 25% discount (current offer at their site), OR if I click on renew subscription from inside Live Safe, they offer a 38% discount, OR.. buy a retail card for a savings of 62% currently here on Amazon digital services.  Clearly, I went for the 62% discount via Amazon, got my code, and proceeded to try to attach it to my existing account.  Thing is.. the instructions are obscure and if you don't do it exactly right.. you will get an error and need to talk to live support.  &#62;&#62;&#62;  How to add this product to your existing active McAffee Live Safe install:  first and foremost.. you must get to the correct website page to start your your journey ----&#62;  mcafee.com/mls/retailcard  then enter the registration code and follow the instructions.  If that fails for any reason, you will need to talk with live support.  Note: I personally did not do this, but the Customer Support person who fixed my problem did (via Citrix remote session) and said it is very important to access the correct retailcard page when adding to an existing account.  Key Point:  Follow the directions exactly as given in the &#34;how to&#34; instructions given by Amazon with the product and you will probably be fine.  If you don't read the instructions and follow them exactly... expect to have issues.  Since they sell a truck load of retailcards (both physical and digital) in the market place, I really don't understand why we can't just add the retail card registration code directly within the McAffee user panel on the PC.  It would be so much simpler and less troublesome.. but hey.. maybe someday.\n",

It works very intuitively and online support was quick and responsive (within two hours I got an email response that completely fixed my problem - I needed to update the drivers to my graphics card). You can choose between different screen sizes to record (or just grab your entire display if needed), press the Record button, do what you will on the screen, and then hit Stop to save. There's an option to hook up a microphone to your computer so you can speak while you record everything on the screen. I just ordered a USB microphone and will test it over the next few days to see how the audio component sounds.\n",
      "5\tI have had PC Matic for over a year now. Just got a new laptop and renewed it again. The best to deal with if you ever have customer service questions too. Talk to someone in English!!  It's a pleasure. .  No pop ups and all that annoying crap to deal with!  I highly recommend !!\n",

      "4\t\"\\\\\"\"Norton Security with Backup\\\\\"\" seems to be the replacement for Norton 360 and perhaps some other similar Norton products. Up to now, Norton had multiple security offerings with different sets of features. Now the main options seem to be 5 devices without backup or this version, 10 devices with backup. (This reminds me of how Microsoft's marketing department works, with Windows Home, Home Premium, Professional, and so on...they like to keep you guessing which one does what.)<br /><br />The best thing about Norton is that it seems to deliver on the security promise. I've seen friends' computers ravaged by viruses...not pretty.<br /><br />When you purchase from Amazon, you receive an email containing the product key and a \\\\\"\"how to redeem this item\\\\\"\" link. The link in turn tells you to go to norton.com/setup and enter the product key. (Not sure why the email couldn't just say that in one spot, but whatever.)<br /><br />What you actually happens is that Norton will ask you to log in to your account, or create an account if you don't have one. Then you'll have a chance to enter the product key. After setting up the first device, all you have to do is log in to your Norton account on the next device, and you won't need the product key again.<br /><br />In my case, I had Norton 360 installed on several systems. Norton Security took care of uninstalling 360 on my Win 7 and 8 systems. I had to uninstall 360 manually on my old XP laptop, but this was not a major problem.<br /><br />I keep a separate administrator account on my Windows systems. Most programs are smart enough to prompt for the admin credentials if you try to install something as an ordinary user. For whatever reason, the Norton Security installer doesn't work this way. I resorted to right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"\"run as administrator\\\\\"\" to get around this limitation. In the future, I'll break down and log in to the administrator account.<br /><br />Norton does continue to have some annoyances. One issue with the new product is that they seem to have removed the ability to allow regular users to configure things like when high CPU alerts occur. It also appears that you must be an administrator to configure backups. Not an issue for folks who always run as administrator, which is kind of like driving without your seat belt. Not a problem until it's a problem.<br /><br />More annoying is the nagging warnings you get as renewal time approaches. With Norton 360, I was getting daily popup windows, which reappeared shortly after I closed them. And the renewal links offered a shamelessly bad deal. Mine offered to renew the Norton 360 5-device license for the \\\\\"\"special price\\\\\"\" of \\\\\"\"only\\\\\"\" $69.99. So the 10-device version seems like a bargain at about $55 here.<br /><br />Now over a week after updating to Norton Security, I'm getting emails about how my Norton 360 has expired. The good part is that my \\\\\"\"special\\\\\"\" price of $69.99 is still available. OK, you are dumb, how dumb to you think I am? These dumb emails don't have an \\\\\"\"unsubscribe\\\\\"\" link.<br /><br />So while the core security function has been working for me, I'm a little tired of Norton/Symantec overall. Right now, the Norton Security tray icon on my Win 8.1 system has a little red exclamation point...it says \\\\\"\"you have not removed outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer\\\\\"\". Well, I don't even *use* Internet Explorer, so probably not a major issue. A colleague once said the only proper use for an exclamation point is the sentence \\\\\"\"I've been stabbed!\\\\\"\". Some folks need to take that to heart.<br /><br />Maybe more serious is the issue of trust. If you \\\\\"\"trust\\\\\"\" Norton to protect your digital life, it's too bad you can't trust them to treat you fairly at renewal time. All the nagging popups aside, at some point they should inform you about the new product, and give you some shopping options if they can't offer a competitive price.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'll be doing some serious shopping when renewal time comes around next June.\"\n",

      "4\tgreat software.  The customer service team and Dan Oaks the President and founder have been working tirelessly to get the website, the Mac software and the iPhone/iPad apps all working together seamlessly.  Just today Mr. Oaks emailed me saying they are working updating the older recipes in the archives so that they are Mac compatible to download.  The new iPhone app is improving on a regular basis.  When the old app wasn't working they decided to tackle it from the ground up and rebuild.  It took a while the but the results are worth the wait.  If you LOVE recipes, have an addiction to collecting them on the web and in magazines and emails etc but need ONE Amazing place to organize them all, Try Cook'n with the apps.  I have not used the Android apps but I understand they work the same way.  I have tried every major and minor cookbook software available for the Mac, this wins Hands Down!  Expect a few glitches as they work out the new iPhone app in phases but customer service is helpful and resolves them efficiently.  Do not let any growing pains deter you.  This Software is the ONLY Software I have ever used with recipe capture right from the internet. For those of us who get bored with our recipes easily we NEED this feature, always being on the prowl for a new idea.\n",

      "5\tI have been using the Creative Cloud since the initial release and being using the CS suites since CS2 and CC is more than what I expected. You get much more than just get the apps you get plenty of services that once you start using you wish you can never go back. Typekit for instance is about $50k worth of fonts and it is available to use with the subscription. The market has plenty of great brushes, clip art, and many templates I use on a daily basis. The cloud storage is also a great way to share PSD files for anyone who doesnt have Photoshop and it is perfect for collaborating and using the automatic version control.<br /><br />I see a lot of harsh reviews and the majority of them are users who didn't even purchase the Creative Cloud. How can you review something that you never used?<br /><br />With the applications we are still getting plenty of updates and they are consistently adding more and more features that make you more productive and save you a lot of time. The new libraries in the Creative Cloud Apps is worth updating to to CC alone. You pretty much have all of your assets like images, fonts, and color swatches saved in a library and is synced though out all of the apps. And if you use the object in the library, let's say the company logo, and your company just updated it. All that you need to do is update the logo in the library and it will update all of the logos in your projects with that library logo. Just AMAZING and such a time savor, also great to quickly add company colors and fonts.<br /><br />I could go on and on about new features and enhancements from CS6 to CC 2015 but I would recommend downloading the trial and going to Adobe's website where they have videos and training's on all of the applications and all of the new features.\n",

      "5\tI bought the Cook’n software a couple of years ago to help me with a food allergy issue. I was put on a 4-day rotation plan, where I couldn’t eat the same thing on consecutive days. I was bewildered as to how I was going to sort all my menus out until I hit on the Cook’n software and its category system. It was a breeze!<br />Another plus is that I can run around the Internet looking for recipes to suit my allergies and, when I find one, I can instantly post it into my software. Even if the recipe doesn’t suit me exactly, I love it that I can tailor any ingredient/amount to what’s healthy for me. I can access my recipes any time; put it on my tablet for easy use in the kitchen; and easily share recipes on social media or e-mail.<br />I recently joined the Cook’n Club. What a gold mine! Besides getting a FREE COOKBOOK EVERY MONTH, I am participating in the Cook’n forum, which is a perk in my day.<br />I recently had technical issues (for reasons still unknown). The tech staff at DVO is top-notch! They stuck with me until the issue was resolved, and now I am enjoying Cook’n all over again.

One important note though, if you plan on using avi's or DivX files, they will not work without a codec pack installed. Other than that small thing, it's great and really worth the price.

It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family's smartphones.<br /><br />However, I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5, and now Adobe's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side.  Specifically, the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers.<br /><br />Looking at updates to the *previous* Lightroom 5, there were bug fixes of course, but Lightroom also gained the following functions:<br />- Lightroom 5.2: added Feather control for the Clone/Heal brush, added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction.<br />- Lightroom 5.4: added support for Lightroom Sync.<br />- Lightroom 5.7: added integrated Aperture/iPhoto importer.<br />Nothing huge, but definitely some useful features.<br /><br />Now with Lightroom 6, features added to the CC (subscription) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product.  The first of these is the Dehaze slider, but I guess there will be others in the future.  And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe.  I'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one.<br /><br />I've read in a few places that Adobe claims the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for.  However, this flies in the face of real world examples from the small (Angry Birds supplying many new levels for the initial 99 cent purchase) to the quite large (Microsoft giving all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users a free copy of Windows 10).  You need a better excuse, Adobe.<br /><br />Edit - if you've own a previous version of Lightroom *do not* buy the Full version here - buy the Upgrade version directly from Adobe and save $70.version directly from Adobe and save $70.\n",

      "4\tWhat do I want most with my anti-virus? Simple, something that runs in the background, doesn't eat up all my resources, and only pops up to let me know when there is a genuine problem (and you should too). This may sound straight forward but is a surprisingly difficult combination to achieve in modern AV software.<br /><br />I have used KAV in the past and decided to ditch it several years back when it started to become a bloated pig like all the other Norton/McAfee products have been quite please. Then after using a competitors AV for several years (about 6-8) I decided to re-evaluate my AV to see if I was still using the best or was there something better.<br /><br />Enter KAV. After some research and a little testing with some known (quarantined) discs, I found that KAV had very good detection of both some very old and very new virus. I also was pleased to find with a little resource monitoring that KAV used somewhat less than my current choice. The interface had been simplified since I had last used it (but still has lots of options) and the sub price point was better as well.<br /><br />The con's. Not too many. There is the occasional false-positive, but I don't know of any AV that is 100% on this (unless they are letting things through the cracks). The only other, which won't be an issue for most, is that there is zero support for windows 10 until it is officially released.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend as long as the Win10 support is ready by release date as I am sure many people will be upgrading given that it's free and easy to do.\n",
      "1\tThe people at McAfee must have engineered this security software with the assumption that it was for the protection of users who are not very good at understanding how to avoid threats on the internet and how to avoid unintentionally downloading viruses and malware.  If you have a seven year old using your home computer to do homework on the net, McAfee Security Center might be worth a look at.  However, if you don't have a seven year old using your PC, and you are aware of some of the risks that are out there, then this software package is probably not for you.<br /><br />I installed McAfee Security Center without any problem.  At first, it seemed to  work okay.  After a while, it took over the system and there was just no way to get any control over it.  It sucked up all available memory.  I run Windows 7 with 4 gigs of physical memory.  It slowed the system up dramatically.  It was preventing perfectly safe sites from loading.  However, I wanted to keep it on my hard drive to use for scans, so I turned it off.<br /><br />Even turning it off didn't work, because anytime I would load a new web page, it would start up again and I would get a reminder message to turn Security Center on.  I installed it a few months ago and uninstalled it within a few weeks.  After a little thought, I reinstalled it a few days ago, hoping for a different result.  Not!<br /><br />For sure, I'm a conservative user.  I don't go to weird web sites.  I don't open email from sources I don't know anything about.  And I really try to keep an eye on security through scans and updates.  For someone like me, McAfee Security Center is sheer overkill.  Maybe if you don't have any understanding of viruses or malware, and/or have a computer with gobs of memory, like maybe a dozen gigs, McAfee Security Center might be a good thing.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't.\n",

And by day three there was nothing the anti virsu program would let me into  but MSN.  I couldn't watch videos because my UTUBE suddenly wouldn't start. Nothing worked. It took me three full days to get the program unistalled because it also blocked me from doing a reset to a prior time which I tried for an entire day.  I finally had to reset my computer to factory settings, loose all of my applications and everything else to get the damn thing out of my computer and start over.

      "1\tI would not buy this crappy software if I hadn't been using Quicken for 10+ years already.  Features don't work as advertised (auto fill was completely screwed up after upgrade until later release), the crack staff have released updates that screwed up thousands of customers, only to pull the release, leaving us stranded, support is left to the &#34;community&#34;.  Expensive, poor quality, terrible support.<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade when the &#34;turned off&#34; web-connect for bank download for the old version I had been using.  This is really terrible, money-grubbing, awful behavior.  They claimed they notified me, but I never received any notice; to make it worse, I lost an entire Saturday morning, because when on-line services stopped working on the morning they decided to turn it off, the old version I had been using, just returned a generic error message.  Once I finally learned what had happened, I was forced to upgrade.  That was a disaster.<br /><br />Like others, I had to install it three times.  On first try, Quicken crashed, leaving the install incomplete and the software would not run.  On the second try, password vault (when using your Quicken Cloud account as the authentication method) didn't work, leaving me locked out of my own data.  On the third attempt, it at least installed, but then many features didn't work until I downloaded several patches.  It wasn't until this past weekend that I found the &#34;Mondo&#34; patch that fixed a bunch of issues.  (Seriously, &#34;Mondo&#34; patch??  Are these programmers high-school hacks that find the &#34;coolest&#34; nerd name they can think of?

      "3\tI'm a relatively new user to this program, so this isn't a definitive review but rather a &#34;first impressions&#34;.  There seems to be a lot to like in terms of features, capabilities, and quality of results. But it's really, really hard to get past just how clunky the user interface is. Some examples:  1) This is really a program for working on a single image. Although it does include a &#34;browser&#34; that lets you pick the image to be edited from a folder, the browser is slow and doesn't really add any value.  2) For Raw files, first you pick the white balance setting, then you open the file. If you don't like the result, you close the file, pick another white balance setting, then reopen the file. Repeat until you're mostly happy. Virtually every other editing program lets you adjust the white balance while you're seeing how it affects the image. Almost every other editing program gives you an &#34;eyedropper&#34; you can use on a neutral point in the image to set the white balance, but not this one. Also, white balance is purely color temperature, with no ability to adjust the magenta/green axis.  3) There is no Undo. This is a non-destructive editor, so it's certainly possible to go back and reset things by hand as long as you remember how they used to be set, but a lot of times it's just easier to hit CTRL-Z to undo a mistake or an experiment. Not here. CTRL-Z takes you to the last &#34;restore point&#34; you create by hitting SHIFT-Z. If you haven't created a restore point, CTRL-Z has no effect.  4) You always have to start from one of the presets. You can create your own Custom preset that has no initial effect and use that as a starting point, but should that really be necessary to do?  5) Before/after comparison is limited to a small window with a movable divider. That's not unheard-of, but most editors provide a button you can press to momentarily show the Before image.  6) There's no preview for the &#34;effects&#34; (the adjustment layers that make the changes). To see if you want to use a particular effect, you have to add it and then, if you didn't want it, you delete it. Deleting an effect always requires clicking &#34;Yes&#34; on a confirmation dialog and there's no way to turn off that confirmation. Since there are 85 effects to choose from, this gets old really fast.  7) Cropping is only available during saving. Cropping is completely free-form and by eye; there are no presets for particular aspect ratios, no way to set a specific crop size, and no way to determine what pixel sizes you're cropping to.  For the photographer who just wants to make his pictures look &#34;true to life&#34; or &#34;slightly better than real life,&#34; there's not much here that isn't available in more established products that have a much more pleasant user interface. Also, as the name suggests, Franzis COLOR Projects provides only minimal capabilities for producing black-and-white images (Franzis offers two other programs for that purpose).  The creative, especially the professional creative tasked with producing color images that project a particular ambiance, flair, or emotional impact, might well find Franzis COLOR Projects to be worth the hassle. It's capable of an incredibly wide range of creative &#34;looks,&#34; and those looks seem to be very nicely done. Learning one's way around the 85 effects and their respective controls, 84 preset settings, and 35 color-film emulations is going to take a fair amount of time and dedication.\n",

Buy from Amazon and pay the 'extra' money over the so called 'discount' offers Movani offers if you install the trial version and then uninstall it. Upon uninstalling, they offer you a 40% discount but after you fill out the payment data, the system gives you an error message and you are back to step one. Their support was worthless (probably India). Now I have to watch my credit card activity daily to see if I was ripped off by them. BUY AT AMAZON AND KNOW YOUR DATA IS PROTECTED. It is worth the extra few bucks.\n",

The Tuneup is offered as a free 24 hour trial but if installed it becomes the most intrusive item running on your computer. It adds drag to your computers performance and good luck uninstalling it. In the end I had to completely uninstall Antivirus 2015 in order to get rid of PC Tuneup. This was not an issue with the 2014 version. Buyer beware.\n",

And I can't tell you how easy it is to use. I am not an accountant. I am not a bookkeeper. I am the owner of an ecommerce store using Amazon and Shopify (actually 3 Shopify stores: US, UK, AU), and transacting in 3 different currencies. My home currency is the USD as I'm based in the US.<br /><br />Quickbooks was nothing short of a pain in the a$$ when it came to reconciling three currencies from my PayPal accounts. And accounting for the inventory across these various stores in Quickbooks.... well, forget about it. What a nightmare and complete time suck.<br /><br />Xero is a breeze to configure, use, and most importantly, implement. Don't get me wrong, you will spend some time importing your historical data into Xero. Most of my transactions consisted of PayPal, bank account, and AmEx charges.<br /><br />I completely trashed all my accounting transactions for 2015 in Quickbooks and started from scratch in Xero.<br /><br />You do NOT need to do this! They offer an import feature if you need to import your Quickbooks file.<br /><br />I wanted a fresh start. So I decided to really learn Xero by beginning from scratch. It was the best way to learn for me.<br /><br />For those of you on Shopify and Amazon (my platforms), I highly recommend you use Stitchlabs to sync it all, then set up and connect Xero to Stitchlabs.<br /><br />Your life will be so much better!<br /><br />Mine is.<br /><br />Now how do I break this news to my accountant...\n",

I purchased Cook'n when I was running Windows, and am now an Apple person, with a MAC, IPad, and IPhone.  So, I have used Cook'n through many Updates, and I must say, they are serious about being the best at Cooking Recipes, and even though I have had issues in the past, their Technical Department has always taken care of me.  Lately, with the new Version, I worked with a Technician that helped me resolve the issue in no time.  Since I was a Baker in my last profession, I value my recipes, and have about 5 personal, printed recipe books, and can share a recipe with anyone.  In the past it was time consuming, BUT NOW, 2 clicks and the recipe is sent, in a beautiful format.  The accessibility to use my recipe in my kitchen, by just opening my IPad is the best use of my time, as I no longer have to search my books.  What I love the best now, and we all have evolved into INTERNET users, is how we can search the internet, find a recipe we like, capture it and put it into our Personal Cook Book, and save it, especially if it turns out to be a 5 Star Recipe.  Cook'n is the perfect organizer for us all who Use, Save, and Share Recipes for our Family and Friends, and I highly recommend it.  Thank you Dan for creating this tool.\n",

Otherwise deal with lawyers, don't buy $300-$600 living trust packages of documents from strangers (companies without attorneys).

      "4\tI previously used spreadsheets and Mint to handle budgets and account balances. I am very happy with the Quicken Deluxe 2015 PC software. It was easy to download, install, and the setup was fairly intuitive.  Figuring out the budgeting system and loan took a little more time but I had an accurate snapshot of my checking account quickly.  The software does not connect to my Wells Fargo 401k account automatically.  I suspect that may be an issue on the Wells Fargo side though.  It tracks loan balances and asset amounts based on linked payments and is excellent at letting me know where my money is going.<br />I am not at all impressed with the Android companion software for Quicken 2015.  It is very lacking in features and the most important part - knowing how much money you have left after all bills are paid - is not available.  It just shows you how much is in your bank account at the moment.  If I wanted to view that I would use my bank's application. In order to see how much money you have left you will need to login to the computer that has Quicken loaded.  Definitely a disappointment. My husband would be more involved in the budgeting system if the Android companion app was better. Would be nice to have an accurate ending balance on the phone and the ability to take a snapshot of a receipt, tag it and assign it to an account rather than having to login to the PC to make individual entries later.\n",

      "5\tI switched to a Mac in January 2014 after being a windows user since the days of DOS.  I was shocked that Quicken wasn't available when I switched over.  During that year I tried iBank and Moneydance.  I wasn't real pleased so was always on the lookout for something better.  I was real happy when Quicken for Mac 2015 came out.<br /><br />I have been using it since September 2014.  I ran Quicken and IBank 5 in parallel from October through December of 2014 to determine which I liked better.  I picked Quicken.  No, it isn't as good as the version I was running on Microsoft in 2013, but:<br /><br />- The interface is superior to iBank every way<br />- Ease of use is superior to iBank in every way (the ease of reconciliation is a perfect example - it is a nightmare on iBank)<br />- iBank's better investment portfolio tools did not matter to me<br />- I did not need the broader reporting capability that iBank provides (I just want reports to support my itemized tax return and these are fine)<br /><br />Rather than converting my iBank files, I decided to start fresh with the new year.  Part of the reason for this is that migrating old files is not easy.<br /><br />I have been very happy.  No issues in downloading transactions from my financial institutions or otherwise.<br /><br />If you are a basic user (track income, expenses, download financial statements, manage budgets, report for tax purposes), Quicken is the best of what is available.  If your needs are greater or you really need all of the advanced features that are available in Windows versions, then you will probably be complaining and may want to look at iBank.\n",

F-Secure is more affordable if you don't need a lot of extra bells and whistles.<br /><br />It's banking protection is solid with only drawback, you can't add any bank websites if F-Secure banking protection can't pick them up. The browsing protection is solid and for those who aren't tech savvy can use F-Secure Safe Search to browse safely for those who do a lot web searching and trying to avoid sketchy sites.

Despite the previous edition (branded NIS) having no problems, Norton Security crashed my system non-stop.  I uninstalled and the problems went away.  Later, I upgraded to Windows 10 and decided to try this again.  So far, Norton Security is working without problems, at least none that I can pin on Norton.  Changing rating to 3 stars.

It also has very a limited reports function (e.g. can't see how my net worth changes from month to month based on the fluctuation in my various investments because the program can't make such reports).  For me, an absolute, unequivocal waste of money.  I bought it because I recently switched from PC to Mac.  But fortunately (?), I did keep my PC. So, when I realized how screwed up this Quicken for Mac program was, I got the Quicken  2015 upgrade(?) for my PC so I could continue to enjoy all the functionality of Quicken I had come to appreciate.  At which point, frustration mounted upon frustration and took me for a ride.  For one thing, Quicken 2015 for PC can't learn categories.  For example, Safeway and City Market (obviously grocery stores) continue to be listed as Personal Care instead of Groceries (so far, can't change it).  My Electric Utility Bill, continues to be categorized as Insurance (so far,can't change it). And I can't switch back to my very useful Quicken 2012 version because Quicken has removed the financial institution download function unless you upgrade (?).  Now I have to go back a whole year and recategorize quacky Quicken's recategorization of my spending.  What a flipping' zoo Intuit has become.\n",

      "1\tI was so excited to get this anti-virus software.  I did all my research, read all the reviews, including the one on PCMag which gave Webroot its Editor's Choice Award.  Then, the minute I downloaded this software, the nightmare began.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I wish I could crawl into a time machine and set the dial for the exact moment in time prior to my purchase of Webroot.  Barring this, no other way exists for me to ever retrieve the wasted hours of my life I spent dealing with this program -- not to mention the time I am now spending writing this magnum opus painstakingly detailing my nightmarish journey.  That time is gone forever.  The only thing I can do is warn others of my experience.  Hopefully someone will benefit from my pain.<br /><br />I strongly caution anyone against purchasing this program unless you have an extremely strong constitution coupled with the patience of Mother Theresa.  If that is you, I wish you Godspeed.  Just don’t neglect to gird your loins in preparation for the uphill battle that awaits you.<br /><br />COMPUTER SLOWDOWNS AND FREQUENT CRASHES:  Not long after downloading this program, my computer slowed down, and I noticed delays between my keyboard and mouse and my computer.  My computer kept freezing up and I could not unfreeze it via the task manager because the cursor was frozen, as well, so I had to perform hard shutdowns.  Then I would reboot my computer and the same thing would happen again.  Although my computer (six years old) would occasionally freeze or stop responding, after downloading Webroot, the change was profound.  It was happening so often I could get nothing done.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I called Webroot and spoke to an extremely surly tech who sounded like I had just awoken him from a nap.  I had to ask him to speak up because he spoke in a barely audible mumble  that clearly conveyed I was inconveniencing him by my call.  My questions would be met by absolute silence -- not just the brief pause one would expect from someone preparing to deliver a thoughtful response -- but more like the Silence of the Lambs – silences so profound and prolonged that I was forced to ask him if he were still on the line.  He told me Webroot wasn’t the cause and that it must be my computer.  Following my conversation with him, I did some online research and found lots of reviews by people who reported the same issue, so it couldn’t have just been my computer out of millions.  Too bad I hadn’t done that beforehand, instead of relying on the “experts.”<br /><br />FAILED TO BLOCK MALICIOUS PROGRAM FROM DOWNLOADING ONTO MY COMPUTER:  I went to a website that had free software and accidentally downloaded a program that turned out to be malware.  I didn’t intend to download this program.  I may have inadvertently clicked on something.  I don’t know.  But somehow it began downloading and running on my computer and I couldn’t stop it.  I went to the control panel and attempted to delete the program, but it would not let me do so.  Instead, it would ask me if I would allow it to make changes to my computer.  I was forced to say yes hoping the “changes” it intended to make were to uninstall it, but of course that wasn’t the case.  It probably just downloaded more crap and poured more and more malicious code onto my system.  Now, mind you, all this it did WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A MURMUR OF PROTEST FROM WEBROOT!!  Contrary to its own documentation (available online) which states that in the event Webroot encounters a suspicious program, it will prompt the user and warn against downloading anything from that site.  Barring that, if Webroot fails to block the virus or malicious program from breaching its security, it is supposed to recognize and quarantine the program so that it doesn’t then go on a rampage, raping and pillaging everything in its path.  In my case, none of the above occurred.  On the contrary, the program downloaded without a hitch.  Afterwards, my system began freezing and crashing like crazy.  And if I thought things had been  bad before, I was grossly mistaken.  Finally, the problem was resolved by my operating system and not by Webroot.  My operating system intervened when I had booted it up for the umpteenth time and ran Check Disk.  I watched as Check Disk ran and read what it was doing.  It was deleting corrupt files, and checking security descriptors.  At one point through all of this, Webroot flashed a notice that it had “removed  a threat.”  Really Webroot?  Not a moment too soon.  Like some fat, lazy security guard who ambles onto the scene of a crime after a civilian bystander has taken down the thug.  Thanks a lot.<br /><br />WEBROOTS’S RESPONSE:  Webroot said that it cannot block all programs from downloading because people call them and complain that programs they specifically want to download are blocked.<br /><br />PASSWORD MANAGER PROBLEMS FROM HERE TO DOOMSDAY:  First, the password manager extension didn't appear on my toolbar.  Spoke to someone in tech support who was very nice and helped me to fix it.  Called again because I was trying to use the password manager and it wouldn't work with a lot of the websites I tried to save.  Initially I thought it was me because I'm not very computer-savvy.  So I went over everything with the tech (who was also very nice) and he walked me through everything until I was sure I understood how to use it.  Then, when I tried working with it on my own, I found out what a horrendous, buggy program it is.  I saved dozens of sites to the password manager that seemed to be working fine.  Then when I would later go and click on them, Webroot would react strangely, sometimes taking me to the site and not filling in the login and password, sometimes only filling in part of the password, etc.  I tried re-saving the login/password info for these sites numerous times. I literally spent hours doing this. The password manager would say it detected a change in the password and when I clicked on confirm, it would either just capture the first character of the new password, or run okay but continue to prompt me that it detected a change in the password every time I logged onto that site.  There were at also numerous sites that I couldn't even get the password manager to work with at all, despite trying again and again, ad nauseam.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I was told by one person in sales/customer support that he used the password manager on his own computer all the time and that it worked great.  He referred me to the online documentation, which I assured him I had already read.  By that point, I was all too familiar with the ins and outs of the password manager feature.  He still found this difficult to believe.  Next I spoke to tech support and was told basically the same thing, that it could not be Webroot that was at fault, but that I must be doing something wrong.  He said that Webroot is the number one software on the market, so I guess then it couldn’t be them.  I invited him to remotely access my computer and check it out for himself.  When he did so, he was surprised that, indeed, things weren’t working so great.  He then proceeded to tell me it must be my computer that wasn’t working well.  I asked him what could possibly be happening on my computer that would cause an internet toolbar extension to malfunction?  He threw  out a few ideas, like maybe I had hardware issues, or another program was interfering with the password manager.  I invited him to look at my programs and see if he could find something that might be conflicting with Webroot and he could not.  NOTE:  Afterwards, I read reviews by others who were treated in like manner.  Apparently Webroot has the attitude that it’s product is perfect and that if the user encounters problems with its software, it must be their fault.<br /><br />ATTEMPT TO GET A REFUND:  Since I purchased this product on Amazon, I was unable to get a refundbecause of Amazon’s policy.  I told Webroot that I wanted a refund from them and was told they couldn’t do so because I hadn’t purchased the product from them.  But surely they had sold the product to Amazon who then sold it to me, right?  So in essence they did sell me the program.  At any rate, I was so disgusted I just wanted to get rid of the damn thing.<br /><br />MY LAST CONTACT WITH WEBROOT:  I grew finally frustrated with one tech and asked to be connected to a supervisor.  I waited and waited.  The line rang, and I thought the supervisor was going to pick up.  Instead, I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO SOMEBODY’S VOICEMAIL!!  I was livid.  I talked to yet another tech and was again told I couldn’t get a refund.  After he had been dealing with me for awhile which, granted, could not have been pleasant by that point, he threw out that I could just get a refund.  When I said that I had been told that was not possible, he insisted that it was.  So conflicting information on top of everything else.  At that point, it was just the icing on the cake.  He told me the my issues about the password manager would be “escalated” to another tech support department who would check on things “from the back end.”  They were supposed to email me the results of their findings by today.  As of this writing, I have heard nothing from them except an email telling me they were going to look into it.  Great.  I was told over the phone that they would have already looked into it by today and gotten back to me.  Buyer beware.\n",

However, it is very annoying when it flags things that are not viruses (which all Antiviruses do) such as Spotify, PowerDVD, etc.. and I have to add them as an exception. These are generally fixed in an update, however they get borked again within a few days.\n",
      "5\tI use Photoshop AND Paintshop.  There are just some things in Paintshop that Photoshop doesn't have (and visa versa).  As a newer photographer, Photoshop is more for the advance user.  Paintshop is for the everyday user at home and it is easier to figure out than Photoshop is.  When I got my Paintshop, it came with Facefilter...not necessary, but was really fun to play with.  It's a program that gives makeup/makeovers for photos a boost.  I had a photo where a girl looked like she had bruises around her eyes.  She was very blonde so you could not see her brows.  In Facefilter, I was able to add realistic looking brows and in Paintshop I used the makeup touchup tool to get the bruises out from her eyes--the photo looked MUCH better with those touch ups.  I highly recommend this software and for the price, you just can't beat it (the Corel site still sells it for almost $80).\n",
      "1\tDoesn't have a sync.  I've read a lot of other issues with basic functionality and connectivity but I didn't experience those.  However, a cloud solution that doesn't have a sync option is pointless.  Everyone else has it, and doing what everyone else does is the bare minimum in any product.  Not what I would expect from the largest cloud provider, except that the cloud services always have some truck-drivable holes. I get 1TB from Google for $120/year.  I have 350GB of photos, and prefer to keep two copies in case I accidentally change or delete in my working directory. It would be nice to archive all my other various and sundry files (such as my old Technet subscription ISOs) so I was very excited about unlimited from a first tier provider of cloud services. I expected all the functionality of the file backup folks like Dropbox, Carbonite, Backblaze, etc. plus the bandwidth of Amazon.  Maybe even some on-line redundancy, geographical separation, etc. Instead I got a product that's like an electric car with a crank instead of a plug.  The largest on-line retailer in the world, with an incredibly high tech distribution center with 100 foot tall automatic product retrieval machines feels that backups of my info (which is important enough that I'm paying for it) should involve a manual process.  I am stunned.\n",

I experienced minimal, what I call &#34;looping&#34; errors, in which tax software asks you to provide some basically irrelevant information during error checking that should have been automatically adjusted but a change you made threw that automatic adjustment out of whack. So you keep getting asked for information out of context but the interface and help sections cannot tell you how to answer. It is usually like, &#34;On line 45 of section 3, you entered '0'; this cannot be a '0.' Enter the correct number of insignificant manifestations now.&#34;<br /><br />All tax programs claim to give guidance, but the help sections are often limited.

      "1\tWe have used Quickbooks for our retail store since it came out, many years ago. It was great at first - easy to use, reasonably priced. But recently it has become difficult to like this software and Intuit itself. Each year they have a new, money-grabbing tactic; abandoning version support, forced, costly upgrades, charging per employee, limiting installs. Now, I am starting an additional business with only two employees. I have been researching using Quickbooks with Payroll, but after reading the reviews here and on the Costco website, I will not be purchasing it. I called Quickbooks directly to ask questions, but the hold time was endless and when I finally reached someone, their English was so poor it was difficult to ask questions and understand answers. I did, however, gather that it would be expensive for me to implement the software for my minimum needs. I suspect that both the on-line and physical versions with payroll include additional and hidden charges that would make using this prohibitively expensive for me, and it is clear the company is migrating to on-line only, so purchasing the physical software is likely to be a waste of money when they abandon that version. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INNOVATIVE INTUIT SOFTWARE COMPANY? I can recall years ago thinking I should invest in Intuit because their products and service were unique and superior to others, but obviously that is no longer true. I will be purchasing a competitor product. Sad.\n",

      "5\tThis is an amazing recorder. So simple and lightweight. Very light on resources and does the job very well. I tested it on GTA V which runs ~60FPS for me and recording brought it down to 45-50FPS range but it's not bad at all considering how heavy on resource a game like GTA V can be. Also tried many other games and most games played and recorded above 60FPS which is a very good thing imo.  I've used Fraps, Dxtory and many others in the past but this one definetely is much better. No complicated stuff just press a button to start recording and when finished press the button again. The videos come out to be very crisp and smooth.  Plenty of options if you wanna configure stuff. You can adjust the resolution and quality of the video so you don't have massive files which take forever to upload to youtube etc.  Haven't tried twitch tv broadcasting as i don't have a fast enough upload to use it it anyways.  Conclusion: If you record videos frequently, this software is an improvement over others i've tried. It should help you a lot.\n",

      "1\tLoyal Quicken customer since 2000, seriously thinking of moving to another program.  The bugs in this version is beyond frustrating.  After four months of using it, I finally called the customer service in May, and after doing everything I was advised to do, the &#34;fixes&#34; only lasted for a week.<br /><br />Issues:<br />- the keyboard mappings for using Window's standard shortcuts (copy/paste/cut) has to be reset every.single.time. you open Quicken.  Even though it says the Window's option is selected the shortcuts do not work, instead I have to select &#34;Quicken standard&#34; then close the program, reo-open and choose &#34;Window's standard,&#34; close then open again and then it works.<br /><br />- I can no longer connect to the Cloud and ultimately sync it with Quicken Mobile which was the reason I upgraded to Quicken 2015 in the first place.  If I connect and sync, the next time I open up Quicken it says my password is incorrect.  I try opening up a backed up version but I can only open up a version that dates back two months.  That is two months worth of input that has to be re-done, think about that - not fun!<br /><br />I have backed up the files, uninstalled Quicken and re-installed.  Same errors persist.  Not acceptable.  I hope the files are backward compatible, I might just permanently uninstall 2015 and use 2012 instead - hopefully without the syncing and mobile options these issues will go away.<br /><br />Intuit, you had a very satisfied 15-year Quicken and Intuit customer in me.

      "2\tI am giving this a 2 star rating because I was not happy with the install.  I was using Quicken Essentials for the Mac and bought this new version last year thinking it would run on Snow Leopard, but it didn't.  I finally updated to Mountain Lion and decided to &#34;go for the gusto&#34;.<br /><br />First off, it requires that you logon to Intuit's website before it will let you have access to your converted  data. This was confusing to me because the installer never explained why I had to logon.  When I got to the site it didn't really do anything except something with Mobile App.  So, I did it and then I was able to get to my data file.  If I tried to skip this step it closed my converted data file.  (FYI, I was also using Intuit's online Chat for help, but they really weren't much help. They never were able to explain why I had to logon just to convert my data.  And when I asked they couldn't tell me where my data was stored ). Based on the way this works, someone without network access wouldn't even be<br />able to convert their data at all.<br /><br />I also keep copies of past years in a separate data files and I wanted to convert these so they would be up to date and usable with this software. The installer took me through the steps again, and again forced me to logon to Intuit.  Come on! I already did this!  Why can't you just convert my files and let me start working with the program?  (I kind of wonder why they did this and did they take a copy of my financial data without my knowledge.)<br /><br />Then I tried to find my newly converted data file, just because I like to know where my data is located on my Mac.  I had to get a techie  to find it because it's now stored in Library under Application Support (and Library is hidden under Mountain Lion, unlike Snow Leopard). I would rather have it prompt me for a location.  Plus, when I found my data file I actually discovered 3 other copies from previous conversion attempts.<br /><br />After all that I was able to get to my data without any problems.  Now I'm just getting used to the new layout, etc.\n",

      "1\tI'm giving this one star because TT has eliminated the Cost Basis Lookup Tool, necessary to compile one's investment costt basis. In the help forums, they actually recommend that one take the hours it would take and compile it by hand, a la prior to the age of computers.<br /><br />https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2757203-cost-basis-lookup-tool<br /><br />In their reviews, people have been complaining how many have been now forced into upgrading to the Premier version from the Deluxe, but the Premier Version also does not do what it has in the past, and worst of all, TT offers No upgrade or alternative. The Premier Version no longer handles one's Investments as it was specifical lydesigned for, and did in the past.<br /><br /> As of 2014, The Cost Basis Lookup Tool has been removed!  This was apparently a subscription service, Gainskeeper, that Turbo Tax used so that at the flick of a button one's cost basis for investments held for many years  could be calculated taking into account reinvested dividends, stock splits, etc.  No where is this admitted to; one finds it out as you fumble and fumble with the software.  I finally called TT.  Their support has not been told about this, but with the 3rd person I talked to, he compared screens for 2013 vs 2014 and found that 2014 no longer has the Cost Basis determination connection button.  TT uses the Very disingenuous reason that they've done this because starting in 2012, investment companies have to keep this information for investments made starting in 2012.  For those many many of us who need it the most, having investments that go back well prior to 2012....TT suggests....and get this.....that you research it out, going back to investment houses you many no longer use or may no longer be in business and figure the cost basis, with  dividends, stock splits, etc., by hand!<br /><br />This is a terrible disservice, obviously designed only to save them money, ignoring the very time consuming, if even possible, burden on the taxpayer.  I don't know other options, but the third person I finally spoke to at TT  knew, not from TT to benefit the customer, but by happenstance, that the company TT had contracted with was Gainskeeper and apparently one can get a subscription (at the cost of more than the total cost of TT Premier) to figure one's investment cost basis.  And wasn't that what Premier was specifically designed for, investments?  So the Gouging is not only at the Deluxe level, but all levels. Given bad options,  I would gladly pay extra to reinstate this option. And, given these changes from quality to gouging for profit, I'd expect more bad news in the future, so disappointing.\n",

They told me how to configure my computer or Kaspersky or Firefox or Eudora - I forget now which or what, but all I can say is they were kind and patient and knowledgeable, and got me through both of my issues. And I loved the survey at the end: one question: helped or didn't help?

I do menus two weeks at a time and finding what I wanted was a nightmare. Now everything is on my computer (iMac 27). I quickly scan the contents of my cookbooks in Cook'n, or I can search for recipes with  particular ingredients. I decide on the meals and then schedule them on my calendar app and print out the calendar. The best thing is that you don't need to print out any recipes. I have the iPhone and iPad apps so I just bring the recipe up on my iPad, put on the stand and use it right in the kitchen. All of these devices sync with the Cook'n cloud so you have your recipes wherever you go. Recently we rented a cabin in a state park and cooked the entire time out of the recipes available on my iPad.<br /><br />Finally, I want note their strong customer support. I have been using this software for over a year now and as updates have occurred in both Cook'n and my devices, a couple of issues arose. I emailed customer support and within 24 hours, they replied and resolved my issue. I would recommend Cook'n to anyone.\n",

      "1\tI waited a few weeks after buying this to write the review since most software updates take a while for me to get used to.  After 3 weeks I still hate this.  The only reason I bought it is because they stop the auto-update capability after a couple years, of course Intuit knows this and they force your hand at buying their new release.  I wish they'd just allow us to pay a bit more to renew the old version.  About 1/2 of my accounts that used to update seamlessly now have some glitch and I have to go in afterwards and fix errors.  It no longer recognizes regular inputs (like monthly dividends) and auto-fills the info, I now have to do that manually.  It's insisting many of my stock accts aren't matched, then attempts to remedy this and goes back in time to make adjustments, messing it all up and taking tons of time to figure out what it actually did.  I suppose if you have a simple portfolio this would work just fine, but it you have a number of investments at different brokerage acts, it's a disaster.  This will be the last version of Quicken I'll buy, if no alternative appears I'm going to go into heavy spreadsheet creation mode and do it myself.\n",
      "3\tMalware bytes is great, but the website protection blocks certain types of peer to peer traffic. I have to disable the website protection to use any kind of p2p software. I purchased it for the actual antivirus, not the web protection so it's no big deal. I recommend disabling website protection and using a combination of adblock and common sense to avoid sketchy websites. Malware bytes is also becoming pretty popular, so I feel like it is becoming less effective as viruses are written to avoid it's detection. It never hurts to run one time scans from other antivirus providers to be more thorough.\n",

      "1\tEvery annual update of Quicken is less compatible with Bank of America accounts.  The program will not maintain links to online checking and credit card accounts.  When links are re-established per Intuit's instructions the software downloads months worth of transactions that need to be deleted manually, ONE BY ONE.  This has become beyond tedious.<br /><br />Please note:  You cannot talk to anyone at Quicken.  You cannot email them.  Online chat is useless.<br /><br />If I did not have my major banking activity with BoA I might think this program is OK.  I have been using Quicken for over 10 years.  However, if you bank with BoA and/or use one of their credit cards often, DO NOT expect Quicken 2015 to work well and DO NOT expect Intuit to care enough to fix this.  They clearly do not.\n",
      "1\tI won't buy this again, it expired. WTF?\n",
      "5\tBuying through Amazon is much cheaper than renewing through Webroot. If you already have the program installed on your computer, you can buy the new version from Amazon and then go into your console and update the key. If it's a new install, it's just straight forward and you will be walked through by the installer program. Webroot also has a nice internet command center where you can see the status of all your protected systems. We have two computers, a tablet, and two phones protected. If any of our phones are lost, you can send a message for it to be audible (if you misplace at your house), you can locate it via GPS (if you leave it somewhere), or if you know it's been stolen, you can remotely wipe all of the data.\n",

Occasionally there are issues but they are usually resolved very quickly.<br />Being a Realtor I usually don't know in advance how much time in advance I will have to prepare meals.  Cook'n helps me make the best of a busy schedule by allowing me to access my recipes from my phone.  I'm always able to access while at the grocery which helps with ideas on the go.\n",

      "1\tI've used Turbotax for over 2o years.  2014 is the last year for me.  For the past 10 years I have owned a rental property in a foreign country and have prepared my taxes using Turbotax Deluxe.  This year I had to upgrade to the Home and Business version at a substantially higher price.  Strike One.  When I started to input my data on the rental property Turbotax software notified me that I had been claiming too much depreciation in past years and would have to file amended returns going back to 2010 as well as filing Form 3115 requesting IRS to allow me to change my depreciation method.  WTF???  I was relying on Turbotax to choose the appropriate depreciation method since I had inputted the fact that the property is in a foreign country and also provided the Canadian address.  Apparently turbotax has been miscalculating depreciation for the past 10 years despite the input data being correct.  Strike Two.  Now I have to do a lot of refiling and may incur penalties and interest (which, I assume Turbotax will pay) but even if I am held harmless the amount of time and effort spent, plus having to hire a CPA to fill out the form (Turbotax has not offered to provide any assistance with Form 3115, nor to pay the CPA's fee) it is still going to cost me big time.  Strike Three!  I am not the only person that has been burned on this depreciation issue.  The Turbotax community website is filled with similar stories.  My guess is that there will be a class action suit against Intuit over this.  They can count me in.\n",

Then the domain user or alternate users on that computer are not prompted to sign in or at least don't HAVE to.<br /><br />I asked Adobe about turning all that crap off and their answer was basically spending the big bucks for enterprise controls. Not even a GPO option or a reg edit. Turds.\n",

However, unable to open program and complete installation. Initially contacted AMAZON for assistance and was referred to Adobe. However, Adobe does not provide either phone or on-line chat support for this product. Adobe basically provides a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) type of support for this product which deals with software installation errors. However, I never even got to installation error messages or a screen to enter my software keys/serial numbers. It would appear that the actual file for installing the software after downloading it from Amazon is missing. Finally went back to Amazon for phone support and &#34;met&#34; Bryan who speculated the download was perhaps not compatible with the latest Apple OS revision. After requesting he agreed to a full refund, which they normally don't provide for downloaded digital products. Refund received promptly. Amazon support was okay in that they refunded my purchase price. Adobe support is non-existant for this product\n",

You export a file in Quickbooks Desktop, import it to Quickbooks Online, TA DA, it works.<br /><br />That couldn't be further from the truth. Prepare to enter an adventure filled maze of data entry and inconsistent terminology as you wander around aimlessly trying to input the report information that quickbooks desktop so easily exports but somehow quickbooks online cannot easily import. Absolutely mind boggling.<br /><br />Fret not, there is chat support........ for a bit. As you make the switch, there is a helpful little window that says &#34;Let Us Help&#34; or what have you. That disappears after about a week or two, and then they would just LOVE to hear your voice instead! You can find the chat support again if you can find the magic path. I may as well include it here:<br /><br />Quickbooks Online Chat Support<br />Sign in to QuickBooks Online.<br />Click the Help (?) icon.<br />Click any link under Topics.<br />At the bottom, click the Contact us link.<br />Select the Contact us tab.<br />Under Get Connect, expand Call.<br />Click the Payroll Live Chat.<br /><br />In addition to my super fun time doing data entry and my taxes going out late because i couldn't make some numbers match.... Intuit thought, no... no, there is more fun to be had.... How about we bill you AGAIN for an annual license even though you bought one on amazon?<br /><br />Oh, you think that's enough? NOPE! How about $27 fee for sending out your payroll! WOOOHOOO!<br /><br />I wish I could send Intuit a bill for my hourly rate of all the time I wasted trying to convert to this product.

      "1\tThis was a solid program for a while on my PC. Enjoyed that it would leave me alone and did what it was supposed to do. Easily programmable and not to difficult to navigate. Recently Norton had issued an update to their software which for some reason had it deleting all my steam games and mods downloaded from Nexus/Steam Workshop. It even attempted to delete the steam overlay. I have over 200 quarantined .exe files that had no threats of any kind. Games like Half Life 2, the entire Fallout series, Warframe, and BattleBlock Theater had been labeled as hazards then were removed without any warning. In order to get them back I will have to remove them one by one out of quarantine and set Norton to ignore them. I imagine I would have to go into Norton and approve every new game installed if I continued with them. Luckily my time with Norton is ending soon so I can easily change services.\n",

      "4\tYou get what you pay for - and for the price, it is good enough. Its $12/year for unlimited BACKUP of photos, including raw. It is not meant to be a live synced drive like OneDrive, Dropbox etc. Contrary to some other comments here, you are able download an entire subfolder, and it comes in as a AmazonCloudDrive.zip file containing the stuff you selected. Also, you can access all the photos and sync using the tablet app, which is what most people do to show their holiday photos etc. (iClould free storage would be too small to have every file at random access).  You should consider the data as COLD DATA to be retrieved in case your local HDD goes kaput or you accidentally deleted something. Saying that though, unlike Amazon's 'Glacial Storage', you actually do have live access to every individual file. I've got over 1TB of photos/videos - probably 80% are raw file photos and jpegs. The rest videos (that are not part of the unlimited deal) So for $12/year to put this into a 99.999% availability offsite cloud storage, its good enough or else, I'll have buy more and more hard disks.  Your workflow could be 1) Take pictures 2) Download to your pc 3) Upload all to cloud first 4) Then work off your raw files. 5) Share/show across all tablets using the tablet app.  With that in mind, the big CON is there's no Explorer / external client to access the files - it is all done via web browser, or tablet app. The problem with this is I cannot sort or select files if I had a more 'normal' client.\n",

      "4\tQuickbooks online plus is a fantastic product, however it can get a little pricey. For example, I've owned quickbooks pro for a number of years, and always upgrade after 2-3 years (the most recent version I've owned is quickbooks pro 2014). With quickbooks online, you have to pay a monthly (or yearly if you choose) subscription price, where as the desktop version is yours to own forever. The amazon price is good for a year only, but after that you'll be at the mercy of intuit's price However, if you believe you'll upgrade every year anyways then it might be worth it. Looking beyond pricing, here are the features I've found most useful in quickbooks online:<br /><br />1. It lives on the cloud: It allows me to work in the office & at home, without lugging my laptop around (this was what I used to do when I had the desktop version). With quickbooks online, you can access your company file from any computer with an internet connection (and there is no software to install). This also means your data is backed up and safe every time.<br /><br />2. Mobile App: Quickbooks online also has a mobile app that can be downloaded for your iPhone (not sure about android or windows). While I believe the iPhone app is still a little basic, it does help me save time. For example, if I'm in the field and I incur an expense (i.e. we buy our workers lunch) I can take a picture of the receipt, enter the amount, payee, select what kind of expense it was from my chart of accounts, assign the expense to a class (I make heavy use of the class tracking feature because it lets me track income for each of my rental properties separately). After I click done, the expense posts right away (which means I don't have to save the receipt and enter it when I'm in front of a computer.<br /><br />3. I save time entering transactions: I have my checking & credit card accounts connected to it. Quickbooks makes matching transactions that you've entered to a bank or credit card charge a snap. For example, ifI buy food using my credit card and enter the expense either through my phone or the computer, quick books will let you match that transaction to the charge on your credit card statement. This makes reconciliation go by much much faster.<br /><br />Overall: If you own quickbooks pro desktop and are considering upgrading, I'd strongly suggest you use the thirty day trial intuit offers to setup a sample company and play around with it. A lot of the features & terms are the same as quickbooks desktop, however the layout is a little bit different and you do have to play with the settings to make it suit your custom needs.<br />If you've never owned quickbooks before, then I would recommend the online version. My review is for quickbooks online plus, but you're needs might be met by quickbooks online simple start or essentials which are a little cheaper. Intuit has a comparison chart so you can see which edition has the features you need.\n",
      "3\tI had used Norton 360 for several years and liked it. I had no problems while using it. I bought a new computer 2 weeks ago. I downloaded Norton Security without problems. I like the way it performs continuous scans in the background and gives indicators of whether websites are safe. However, a malware program got onto my new computer that called itself &#34;cassopesia&#34; (I am not sure of the spelling). It was a pseudo Internet search engine that would launch itself whenever I tried to use Internet Explorer or Firefox. The malware did not cause any harm to my computer, but it prevented me from using the browsers I wanted to use. It also allowed countless ads to appear on my computer, even though I had installed Adblock for both IE and Firefox. Norton Security did not detect that the program was on the computer. I called the 800 number for customer service. Apparently, Norton has farmed out its customer service to a third party. Even though I had just paid for the program, I was told I would be charged $249.99 to have the malware (that Norton Security missed) removed from my computer. I felt I had no choice because the computer was unusable as it was and I had to access the Internet to work on a project for work that was due that night. I was told that the fee would include a free year of Norton Security. The customer service representative that assisted me used two freeware malware removal programs and never did remove the malware or 2 other programs (adware) that had installed themselves. He was able to get IE and Firefox to work, although he admitted that &#34;cassopesia&#34; was still on my computer. I was able to complete my project that night and meet my deadline for work. I then had time to research malware removal programs the next day. I found online reviews that stated that Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is the best program of its type. There is a free version that just scans when you ask it to; it then removes the malware that it found. The commercial version will scan continuously in the background and alert you if malware is detected. It will then remove the malware. I downloaded the freeeware version and ran a scan. It immediately found the &#34;cassopesia&#34; malware that the 2 programs that Norton Security Customer Service failed to detect. Malwarebytes removed that program as well as the 2 adware programs that Customer Service identified but could not remove. I am not saying not to buy Norton Security because it does do some things well. However, it also misses some malware, and its customer service practice comes close to extortion. I will continue to use it because I have almost 2 years of service paid for, but after that I will explore other options.  Addendum: 7/6/2015 I would like to upgrade my rating to 3 stars from 1 star. Apparently the program that downloaded itself onto my computer is called a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP). Here is what Norton's customer service told me today: &#34;Potentially Unwanted Programs do not fall into the definition of harmful software; hence Norton does not detect those as a threat.&#34; Apparently I had a PUP on my computer that scammed me. Norton stated today that they do not charge for customer service. I would rate Norton Security higher than 3 stars if it detected and removed PUP's. The PUP apparently directed me to an 800 number connected to the PUP and not to Norton Security's customer service. Live and learn, I guess. Hopefully, this will help someone else.\n",
      "1\tIt REALLY is as bad as everyone says.  I figured I would try it and deal with (learn) the platform differences.  But, I couldn't even start.  Intuit's conversion utility that needs to be run on a Windows machine to convert your Windows qdf file to a MAC importable qxf file doesn't work.  I contacted intuit customer support via Chat and they confirmed utility is &#34;busted&#34; and they offered to do a &#34;partial&#34; conversion for me if &#34;I SENT MY DATA FILE TO THEM !!&#34;.....I'm not going to send my financial data.<br /><br />So as far as I'm concerned, its busted right out of the box.\n",
      "4\tI've been using Kaspersky Internet Security for 6 years and after I discovered Amazon,  I continue to come back. I'm pretty thorough in my price shopping and when it comes to price, no one I know beats Amazon, not even close. Don't be concerned about saving additional money by buying an open package, I've done it when available, no problems. . Of the top 5 like products, the companies engage in adding, improving features, etc., by leap frogging each other so I guess I MIGHT have found something a little better, however, Kaspersky has been stable, no crashes, easy to fine tune. I especially like the &#34;Virtual Keyboard&#34; and the &#34;Safe Money&#34; apps included in the package, read about them as space here is too little to cover adequately. Stick witb the Internet Security package, costs a little more but seriously  worth it.\n",
      "5\tGo to the paragon web site and get the latest version of this software- Paragon migration OS to SSD 4.O (English)  My story how I wound up using this software great software:  I got the 256 Gig version of this Adata SSD(Solid State Drive for my desk top computer. Once properly installed and operating it ran great and fast-I ran Parkdale speed test and it ran 10 times faster than my old Hard Drive (HD). Strangely I saw no difference in the window index experience but the computer was noticeably running faster.  This is my first rodeo with SSD but not with HD's. The first problem I ran into is that my computer OS(widow vista)did not recognized this drive so it makes the Acronis software difficult to run with this problem. I went on Youtube and found this is a basic problem with these SSD drives, any brand. Anyway I went to YouTube and watch this video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3zSenz4m80 The fellow on this video explained this problem with a Samsung SSD drive and shows how to fix it by using the management features found on windows.  Once I got pass that I down located the free Acronis software per the instructions that the Adata gave. Well that downloaded software did not work. I wasted about 3 hours trying to do that. no dice, I went to Acronis website and down loaded the 14 day trial version of migration software. It down loaded fine and the software worked fine without using any codes and such. With the trial version I migrated my HD data to the SSD, no problem.  I used the 2nd HD slave space on my computer instead of the USB port to install the migrated data because I didn't have the cables and adapter to connect this SSD drive thru the USB port. It copied my main HD drive in about 20 minutes- sweet. I was replacing a 500 Gig drive with about 130 gigs of used space on it. I was expecting the migration software to fail but it worked okay. It transfer the data from larger Gig size HD to the smaller Gig sized SSD.  It should not be that hard to do, but it is. HD memory have always been a pain to install so SSD's are not any different. I spend about 8 hours messing with this drive by going to researching different web sites,watching different YouTube videos and just manipulating this drive. The next installation should take about 20 minutes or more. My suggestion to the Adata manufacture is that they should provide the instruction with a detailed video on YouTube for rookie like me-showing from unwrap to final operations including the drive manage features of window.  Anyway have fun. I used an old computer I had to test this SDD to see how it worked. It was worth the hassle. I have other newer computers I need to install SSD;s it will be snap to do now that I understand the procedure. Next time I will buy a SSD that comes with a kit with USB cables included for migrating my Lap top computer HD to the SSD. Asked the vender if this one should come with the USB cable adapter if you are upgrading your laptop or where you can get one.  Second purchase( 8 months later):: This time for my computer with a OS windows 7 and with a I,000 gig hard drive I bought this same drive again because it works and I thought it was going to be a piece of cake. How wrong I was The acronis software explained that it would require several boots to clone the drive. So I let it do it's thing. It didn't work properly. It copied the part with the operating system and finished there. It did not boot several times only once so it finished there with 30 gig formatted on that drive. I perform the same thing several times and the same thing happen. I went to the manage part of windows and viewed the SSD and it was split in two different Volumes. messed with the volume's.. I later found out I should have just extended the volume to attach them together. Somehow I thought I had lost 18 Gb of the SSD by messing with the volumes . So the SSD drive now has 238. shown in windows disk manger instead of 256 Gb. The bios still shows it has 238 Gb This was strange so I check several help blogs in the internet and found this is a normal size memory that windows lets you see for a 256 SSD  The missing 18 Gb is hidden doing some other work that the SSD needs to do. So I decide to go with that size memory.   I looked for another migration software and found one called Paragon Migrate OS to SSD 4.0 English. Paragon some bad reviews on amazon but I decided to give it a shot. It cost 20 buck for the password to unlock their down load. I selected the 64 bit version and used that. I installed that and used it. It worked like a charm. What I liked about this software is that it does not required you to reboot for the software to  do it's thing. A window appears and the progress is shown there. It does it's thing until it is complete. No reboots until the work is completed.  This is my main desktop computer and it works great now, again 10 times faster. This computer has a small power supply (220 watts). I check the load to see how that was. It normally draws about 77 watt at idle mode now with the SSD it is drawing  63 watts. So it used about 14 watt less. With use on different loads the 14 watts savings stay about the same.  I found that the paragon migration performed a better job that Acronis.In fact windows perform excellent using this software, The other computer that I used acronis- the windows is a little unstable when it boots and during operations I lose windows every so offend. It just a redundant old computer I have so it's not that important to me. It was having this problem on the original drive so it must have been an existing hardware or software problem. I just used this computer as a test platform so it's okay. So mission accomplished on the second drive using paragon software.  Next:  I will remount the first SSD I bought into my new laptop with windows 8.1. First I Migrated software using the CD port of the laptop to the SSD. Paragon migration worked fine. The SSD is now installed and running on my laptop. Missionaccomplished. Windows 8.1 is running as fast as windows 7 when using the mouse and keyboard. The touch screen is as fast as a Microsoft Surface Tablet. Sweet.   In conclusion- Paragon migration OS to SSD 4.O (English) software saved the day. I am glad I bought this product\n",

      "1\tDO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!<br />As a small business owner (multiple retail locations), I will make a conscious effort to write a pragmatic review to hopefully help others, but the 1st line sums it up.<br /><br />My top 2 complaints are 1. Price vs. value and 2. Memory usage.  I would gladly take my non-supported QB Pro 2012 back in a heartbeat.  After being forced to upgrade, I have quickly come to the realization that Intuit made some changes to the UI/appearance and added a few menu options, but that's about it.  This, combined with things like &#34;Online Banking&#34; which is now &#34;Bank Feeds&#34; that no longer work in the native (QB) application just degrade the return on investment.  I'll provide additional details later...<br /><br />Second, and this is a big deal: QB Pro 2015 is a SYSTEM HOG.  I'm not sure if it's all the background connections or just the software itself, but when I open QB, EVERYTHING on my laptop slows down to a crawl.  The only way to get everything back up and running is to force-close QB and restart.  My other latency complaint is that when you're working in QB, every mouse click and keystroke has a noticeable delay.  This makes ledger entries, adding transactions, editing transactions and just about everything else a headache.  I can honestly say that just due to the latency alone, it takes me about twice the amount of time to perform routine tasks vs. QB Pro 2012.  I've setup a lot of rules for adding transactions, but still have to manually add more than a handful each week... this has gone from quick and easy to beyond painful.<br /><br />Misc notes (based on what I've discovered so far):<br />-Bank Feeds (formerly Online Banking) does not work within the application, even if your accounts were imported from a previous version and setup.  I now have to visit each financial website (banking, credit card, etc.) via browser and download the file from there + import.  This 1. takes significant additional time and 2. completely defeats the purpose of setting up the capability within QB.<br />-The maddening yellow &#34;What's New&#34; pop-ups: I think I finally got them to go away, but these were irritating to say the least.  Most were duplicates (same screen) and again, added to the latency of the software by taking forever to clear.<br />-Payroll: I'll spare all the repeats, as enough feedback has already been written about the new payroll service.  We've switched providers and I encourage other small business owners to do the same.  Intuit's new payroll service and per-transaction pricing are ridiculous.  Read the fine print carefully, because even if you do all the work, there is still a per-check fee.<br /><br />My recommendation to those considering this software is DO NOT BUY.  There are alternatives out there and this will be our LAST Quickbooks purchase.  My recommendation to Intuit (for what it's worth) is to take a mulligan, punt, or whatever and chalk this release/edition up as a lesson learned.  There has to be a pricing model that makes sense to 1. remain on a prior version yet 2. provide subscription updates.\n",

      "5\tI read some of the reviews here and was concerned about what was being posted.  I've used QuickBooks for 15 years and I've taught classes to help others learn it.  Having been a CPA now for 25 years, in my opinion QuickBooks is the single easiest and best accounting software ever made.  Mastering all the features and best practices of QuickBooks takes a little patience and collaboration with other good accountants who know the software well but once you understand how to use QuickBooks it is an enormous time saver.  If you're stuck with using some of the features try looking for videos on Youtube or take one of the classes on Lynda.com.  It may take you a year or more to learn how to get the best out of the software but it's well worth the investment.  As you read the negative comments here, please be cautious about making your decision based on what some are saying.  Every accountant I know loves QuickBooks and it's oftentimes the first and only software we want to use.\n",

My purchase of Movie Studio was made after downloading the trial and seeing my imported video divided into sections which was my purpose. This encouraged me to then buy the software. What I hoped to accomplish was to divide my 2 hour captured VHS video into defined sections for easier viewing. Indeed there were sections, but when I tried to insert an &#34;empty space&#34; or an &#34;envelope&#34; sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Once the empty space was inserted, the length was too long so I tried to make an adjustment...so difficult and it never did work!!! Trying to undo and start again was a horrible experience! I literally had to close the program and then once reopend, I got error after error message until finally it did work. Then I had to start all over again. After this failed attempt, I tried to just create a nice transition effect which also was very difficult to do and finally I just gave up on that. Since I had paid good money for the program, I tried simply making a nice title. Yes, I did that easily, but when I tried to change the background to one of their custom colors - well that didn't work either. Now I am left with yet one more useless and expensive program on my computer. Unless you simply want to combine already created small video clips into a larger video, I would stay away from Movie Studio 13!\n",

      "1\tPURE UGLY - I bought Bitdefender Total Security 2013 Value Edition M2 - 3PCs/2Years originally to get rid of products like it. And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.<br /><br />Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have encountered.<br /><br />Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.<br /><br />Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it still wouldn't uninstall.<br /><br />When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads.<br /><br />Your computer, your choice.<br /><br />Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible.<br /><br />Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?  Please send them to albackus@gmail.com.<br /><br />Today is July 4, 2015. I’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. Stay tuned.\n",

      "2\tAfter using Quicken since it went on the market for Windows and upgrading from time to time now finally to Quicken 2015 for MAC following Quicken Essentials I am disappointed. Quicken 2015 looks and acts too different....it is hard to start using especially to reconcile accounts out of the box compared to earlier versions; is not as easy to navigate on the screen and does not display what I want to be looking at on the default displays; and seems very unfamiliar at least initially. I am glad I did not delete the previous version after converting. I have been running it in parallel with Quicken Essentials for two months after converting the Essentials file, and I'm I still not comfortable with it.  I have to admit that the file conversion was easy; but, using the new program for simple, familiar things is NOT. I do not use the program to it's max and I'm certainly not a power user. Primarily I use it for record-keeping and maintaining account balances (for accounts paid by different methods) that's reliable and portable and easy to use. Most previous Quicken versions in Windows and Mac were comparatively easy use from the outset but each new update got  progressively more difficult. I hate that trend. What I like about Mac &#34;Apple&#34; stuff is that they don't stick you with profoundly different feeling and functioning software update. There are other MAC financial programs out there that do the basics. Sorry I didn't check it out before purchasing Quicken 2015; but, you should. If I had the opportunity to do it over I'd stay with Quicken Essentials while checking out other options. IMHO the upgrade is not much of an upgrade.\n",

I've spent about two days getting everything set up, including various tests, etc.  It would have gone faster if I had removed the AVG trial version first; when removing the trial version it gives you the choice to reinstall the free version and that is what a person should do.  Before beginning to install AVG, make sure you know the name of your network if you have two or more computers on a network on which you'll place AVG.  When getting the code in the email or on the web after purchasing the AVG product, make sure you write it down!  When you get your user name and password on AVG's web site, make sure you write that down also!  When you install the software everything goes rather smoothly if you followed the steps correctly.  I had a problem on one computer with an error in the software, but it asked whether I wanted to repair the software--I said yes and after several minutes everything was working OK.

      "5\tI have been using Quicken and QuickBooks for many years, and I think Quicken is the best personal money management software out there.  You can customize items for sorting - I use it for rental properties (their rental property software is lousy in my opinion), but you can use the various information fields for different rental properties and it works very well.  I wish that the predictive text would only predict entries in each account rather than predicting entries from another account - I have about a dozen rental property accounts to manage, and the predictive text often predicts an item appropriate only to a different account when downloading from the bank.  I especially like the new feature of being able to preload reminders for bills, as the insurance bills for the various properties come in at odd times, and keeping track of them has been difficult to do manually.  I don't think this was in the earlier version I had  been using.<br /><br />The reporting function takes some getting used to, as the filters sometimes are confusing, but once you get used to setting up a report, you can reuse the report year after year by simply changing the date range.  This is a nice feature in my view, especially at tax time.  It has a lot of goodies for helping with income tax, but I don't use them - they may be a help to many though.  Not sure.  But the reporting function and the ability to customize the reports is very useful.<br /><br />I also use the software for managing personal finances - all the goodies for budget etc are useless to me, but they don't hamper using the basic functions, which is really a good thing, as many other software companies add features that make the basic functions more difficult to use.  Intuit does not.  If you are left brained, it is great software.  If you are right brained, as my wife is, the predictive text problem is vexing for her.

It was the perfect idea, no cables no laptop sitting around. I bragged on my Movavi software and all my video editing capabilities and such. Well I brought the Power Point home, set up Movavi (just like i have hundreds of time before to capture other things), started the presentation and started cooking breakfast. I come back in and Movavi is frozen no response, first time I have ever experienced this. I had time to try it one more time before work so i set it up and watched it the whole time (FUN FUN) clicked end show, and yet again it freezes up no response. So at this point im pretty agrivated so i get online and look around for some ways to convert the file directly. AND GUESS WHAT I FOUND?! Movavi has POWER POINT CONVERSION SOFTWARE.

I don't know how iBank compares to other Apple finance programs, but I would give it one star. The program is not difficult but it requires numerous steps to do simple things. As someone commented it is hard to understand how to generate a simple report. The manual is not vey helpful, you spend time trying to find something and then when you find it the description is confusing. You cannot speak to a support person. You engage in online chat, which makes it even more difficult to describe and then resolve problems. My wife has a much cheaper program for Apple - it is not very good, but it is no worse than iBank5 which costs much more. In brief the program is not easy to use, it is hard to solve even basic problems, and the support from the company is lacking. I can't see any good reason to buy this program.

When I read some negative reviews before I purchased the download I chalked it up to people who had older versions of Quicken and then bought or downloaded the latest version.  In other words, they had something to compare the latest version to.<br /><br />Pros<br />I really like that my bank accounts, retirement accounts, HSA accounts, and brokerage accounts can be synced and downloaded into Quicken.  It is a great site to have all your accounts on one screen.<br /><br />Most of my accounts were set up to sync except a HSA account where I invested the money.<br /><br />When I had an issue I would go to the Quicken forum, ask the question and usually get a correct resolution.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Some brokerage accounts like Vanguard do not download correct data.  Sometimes cost basis ends up in share amount etc.<br /><br />When you start on Quicken unless you have one of two accounts you spend days cleaning up all the incorrect information that was downloaded from your accounts into Quicken.<br /><br />After using it for 3 months, there is garbage downloaded that is just strange.  Example, I could not reconcile a bank account and Quicken mysteriously downloaded 2 deposits that I never deposited.  Had to delete these in order to balance.<br /><br />Also, my HSA account transactions mysteriously were added into a Savings account even though the accounts were not tied together.<br /><br />I am constantly correcting stock prices, share quantities and cash balance accounts.<br /><br />It seems like the time spent correcting and balancing my accounts has become a full time job.\n",

I did download the app for mobile and so far, my accounts have been in sync. Overall, I think it was a sound investment for beginners like myself who want to update from using old school handwritten means for budgeting.<br /><br />I'll have to work with the Program more to see if I run into some of the issues that I've read about but I'm optimistically looking forward to no particularly bothersome glitches.\n",

LATER:  and the I learned that Quicken for Mac could not do certain reports I had become accustomed to using, so I broke down and bought Quicken 2015 for PC  .  And then, much to my horror I quickly learned that Quicken 2015 for PC can't learn categories.

Instead it has been a way to rapidly contact abysmal technical support. All contacts with technical support have been in India. I sense they've outsourced the entire Quicken product line to India. Release 6 came out in early May 2015. Note how the number of one star reviews has increased since that time.\n",

However, as the years went by and I was updating to later versions and / or / upgrading to more comprehensive versions I ran into two problems.  One of these problems was that Quicken would not allow me to use records created on a less comprehensive version on a more comprehensive and later version and the number of bugs that I kept finding increased exponentially.  Not being able to scroll down sufficiently to see the totals is a massive problem and clearly demonstrates that whoever designed/programmed and or tested it, has no idea that being able to see the totals is very important.  I suspect that the design, programming and testing were done in India, Philipines or South America in order to save money at the expense of providing a quality product.  I have reverted to a 12 year old desktop because it has a very old but far more reliable version of Quicken. When that PC craps out, I will revert to using a spreadsheet.

      "4\tFor many years I'd used Microsoft Security Essentials, as it did the job.  However, by early 2014, I'd noticed that increasingly often when I'd get performance issues, it would be MSE doing some sort of scan, and after the Windows XP retirement date, Security Essentials would stop working on my XP box whenever I tried to update it via Windows Update.  That convinced me to try the Kaspersky trial, and when it ended about 8 months ago, buy it via Amazon, where at the time the price was a very reasonable fifteen bucks.<br /><br />And it's been good.  I haven't had any performance problems with it, which makes it worth the price over MSE.  And, although it hasn't found any viruses - I typically only get one every 3-4 years - it has warned me of suspicious sites while browsing a couple times.  So all in all, I'd recommend it.  It's only because I don't put it to a strenuous test that I rate it 4 instead of 5 - I've yet to see it perform any miracles.<br /><br />The remaining likely question is, why go with a paid solution instead of a free one if the free ones are sufficient for catching the viruses you get?  I'd gone with free for years for this very reason.  Lower performance impact certainly is a factor.  But Kaspersky also does some pretty good security research and investigation (such as what's described at http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/).  For a pretty reasonable annual rate, I don't mind supporting them in that endeavour, and also getting a low-performance-impact, high-accuracy antivirus product in the process.\n",

      "5\tI've used several other Windows system maintenance products and haven't used one for many years because I didn't trust any of them. They've all caused problems when I've let them do everything they want to do, and it takes way too much time to pick and choose from hundreds of registry errors, unneeded files, etc. One of those products rendered my system unbootable, which was a pain to fix, and one of them actually had a class action suit filed against it because some of its functions didn't do anything. Recently, I offered to help with a friend's computer that was running very slowly and freezing up. I only had it for a couple of days and didn't have time to fix everything by hand. So I installed and ran the trial version of Advanced SystemCare. It improved performance a lot and didn't screw anything up. As far as I know, the system hasn't had a single freezeup or blue screen since I gave it back. I now have activated versions running on my own computers. It takes a substantial leap of faith to let one of these things loose on a system on which you depend. So far, this one does what it's supposed to and hasn't caused a single problem. It's quite obvious to me which functions are included in the package (a lot) and which are optional upgrades. The &#34;Action Center&#34; tab offers huge discounts on the &#34;pro&#34; versions of the anti-malware, driver updater, and defragger. So far, I haven't needed them but the prices are so low ($3.99 to $5.99) it seems foolish not to take advantage of them. I've read the reviews from people who have had problems with the product and my guess is that their systems were massively screwed up to begin with. You can do a lot of damage with an admin account if you have no idea what you're doing and there are no system maintenance products that perform miracles.\n",

      "3\tI bought Omnipage 18 as an update from my very old 4.0 edition. Nice improvement to the product on the whole and at a good price.<br />The reviews that have mentioned script errors etc. are correct in that there is a problem with the version that downloads from Amazon. I had a bit of difficulty locating the right place at the Nuance support site for asking for help with the problem, but once I found it and submitted my issue, I received a link to download the fixed version fairly quickly. (A day or two if memory serves.) The fixed version was provided as a limited-time FTP download, and for whatever reason the FTP link they sent me did not work as intended (I guess) in Windows. Fortunately, I'm familiar with FTP have a couple of FTP clients to choose from. Logged on that way and downloaded without difficulty.<br />So I guess the word of caution is, in exchange for the good price deal, you will have a few hassles.  Nuance should simply make the file available in public permanent link. You still have to key your code/serial/whatevertheycallit into the new version of the file, so I really can't see why they do this one support ticket at a time, but that's how it is.<br />As for Nuance support in general, I have only needed it once before in years of using Omnipage... and I don't expect to need it again for a long time, so it's not much of a factor.\n",

      "4\tI recently bought proDAD's video speed modifying software, &#34;ReSpeedr&#34;, to try slow-motion with video. I knew from samples I had seen that there were likely to be picture artifacts with this software (and also with a more expensive alternative, &#34;Twixtor&#34;), but it appeared that with care, and with some subjects, results could be at least adequate. But, my first attempts with speed changes of 1/2X, 1/4X, 1/10X, 2X, 4X, and 10X with a difficult video clip were poor, and they indicated that the best results were likely to be with subjects that moved against plain (or at least out of focus) surrounding areas, did not move rapidly through the frame, and did not intersect the frame edges. This unfortunately precluded the use of some subject material that I was looking forward to rendering in slow-motion. I then tried using Sony Vegas to render 60p footage as 30p, slowing it (with the &#34;Velocity&#34; control) to half-speed. This worked fairly well, but I was looking for greater speed changes. On a whim, I tried placing the Vegas 50%-slowed video clip (which had a considerable amount of fine detail in it, and which also had things passing in front of and behind other things) on the ReSpeedr timeline. I set the speed control in ReSpeedr for 1/4 speed for a total speed-change factor of 8 between the two programs. I did not expect much - but I was quite surprised by the final outcome (shown on YouTube). In ReSpeedr I had set the speed to &#34;25%&#34;, the &#34;Sub-Frame Mode&#34; to &#34;Optical-Flow&#34;, with &#34;Stabilize&#34; selected, with &#34;Rolling-Shutter Compensation&#34; deselected, and with &#34;Use of Original Frame Rate&#34; (29.970fps) selected, and hit &#34;Start&#34;. The resulting clip showed slight anomalies at the extreme frame edges and (in a surprisingly minor way) with things passing near other things, but overall the results were very good. I then put the clip back into Vegas and stabilized it again there (at &#34;10%&#34; which further smoothed the motion and it also trimmed off the extreme picture edges, &#34;cleaning&#34; those of artifacts - with a result that retains a considerable level of fine detail in the video (although this is somewhat spoiled by the further compression and transcoding necessary for practical streaming on YouTube). Some &#34;curious&#34; artifacting still remains - but at the level at which it exists here, I do not find it objectionable. The original was shot with a Panasonic G5 (several Panasonic MFT cameras produce very sharp video...), with a Rokinon 7.5mm &#34;fisheye&#34; lens, hand-held (without the aid of braces or handles). I later tried shooting a test using 4K video (shot with a Panasonic GH4 at 30fps) and this also worked well when stabilized, slightly cropped, and then reduced to 1080-30p in Vegas (this is also on YouTube – search my name there to find these samples). Overall, I’m pleased with what I can achieve using ReSpeedr in combination with other programs – although processing time when using the highest quality settings can be rather lengthy, even with the use of a very fast computer. Also, this program is very easy and intuitive to use, a BIG “plus” for me...!;-) I recommend it, especially given its moderate price and (potentially...) very good results.<br />--DR\n",

      "1\tI've dropped this from 2 star to 1 star.  I was so glad when Amazon blitzed everyone on price, and then they made their service effectively unusable by not having a sync option.  Google, M$, Dropbox all have a sync folder option.  Apparently, Amazon used to have one but got rid of that feature.  Amazon is dominating cloud services in the business world, but they rely on 3rd party solutions to perform things like security, monitoring, etc.  I trust Amazon more than I trust anyone else (especially Google), but not having a sync or command line option means that I can't figure out a way to automate my cloud backup (using WinZip Pro with encryption).  Why would I use one of the most advanced features the world has seen (cloud computing) and then use a service that requires a manual process for mission essential functionality.  &#60;Revision&#62; It doesn't always tell you which file failed.  Backups (e.g. cloud storage) needs to be reliable.  Either they're done or you missed something that your wife is gonna be annoyed about.  I just told it to upload a directory that had some files in it that I had copied earlier and many new files.  It asked what to do when it saw a duplicate file and I said don't reupload.  I received the message at the end (but as soon as I did something it went away) &#34;203 files copied, 5 files skipped, 1 file failed to upload&#34;.  Copied files are great, skipped files are good since that implies that they were there already, 1 file failed to upload and they didn't tell me what file.  There are no logs to look at.  I'm having to do a directory list and compare side by side.  Revision 2 - If you have many or large files or multiple drives of files (since it's UNLIMITED!) you're screwed.  It lets you download 5gb or 1,000 files via web interface, or you can download everything via the desktop app.  There is no select file with the desktop app, it is all your files.  I have 3.3 tb of files (from several drives) and my largest drive is 2.7tb.  Myfiles are winzip files which have been parsed (2gb each) and I wanted to download one set to ensure that they can be restored.  I cannot select a set of files to download, and I don't have room to download all files to one drive.  I love Amazon for ordering stuff, but they really don't have their act together in technology.  The Kindle Fire has an obnoxious overlay to the Android interface and they don't have MicroSD (so they can charge for any capacity instead of supporting expandability).  I am an IT professional (which is why I want a total backup), but this is the worse product I've seen released in the past 8 years.  If it was any company that relied on this product for income they'd have gone under.  They tried to leverage their commercial/federal cloud market share into the consumer market but the consumer market relies on finished products instead of self-service development.\n",

It is quite a bit more complex.  Lightroom has robust import capabilities for your iPhoto / Aperture Libraries that will import EVERYTHING - like the TRASH in iPhoto / Aperture that you forgot to empty, as well as photos from your PhotoStreams. (Hindsight indicates that it would be best to clean iPhoto / Aperture libraries prior to Lightroom import.)

      "1\tLike many others I'm super-frustrated with TurboTax 2014 DELUXE.  Changes have been made to the DELUXE version this year such that it is incapable of completing a simple return for a college student earning less than $10,000 per year.  After appealing to Intuit's customer service without remedy my trust in the company has been broken.<br /><br />My daughter received a small scholarship from a trust, resulting in a 1041 K-1.  This has been a regular occurrence for my children for many years, and in all prior years this was easily handled by the DELUXE edition.  This year (2014 returns), reductions in functionality have been made to the program such that the PREMIER edition is required to complete this tiny aspect of her return (literally $219 of income).  These changes were made, in my opinion, without adequate notice of the changes - a &#34;bait and switch.&#34;  All of this was discovered, of course, during a last-minute rush to complete the return, requiring an upgrade to the PREMIER edition from within the program at the retail price directly from Intuit.<br /><br />Intuit apparently did offer a partial rebate but that window expired before I found out about this problem.  I appealed to Intuit customer service.  The lady was agreeable but ultimately unable to offer any remedy.  I hope it was worth the $30 upgrade to the PREMIER version that I was compelled to pay at the last minute, because I intend to do everything I can to make sure that was the last dollar Intuit ever receives from me.<br /><br />By the way, I'm a degreed accountant from a prestigious school, and have worked for many years in &#34;Big 4&#34; public accounting, and corporate controller positions.\n",

      "3\tIf you have never used Quicken before, frankly there is nothing like it. And the manufacturer, Intuit, knows that and grossly overcharges for it. Their product development costs have to be minimal, as the basic product itself hasn’t changed substantially in years. In today’s world of free and nearly free apps for our phones and tablets, it is hard to justify why Quicken costs as much as it does.<br /><br />If you have used Quicken previously there is precious little reason to consider an “upgrade” more often than every 10 years or so. And then you are better off just buying a new full-retail version from Amazon or any other reseller rather than get a product update from Quicken at a cost that’s actually more than buying the full version anywhere else.<br /><br />When buying Quicken you are faced with an array of different versions. Hint: most of the functionality is the same in all of the versions, with only a few relatively minor tweaks to customize them for different user preferences. It is critically important for you to realize that the “Starter” version is for first time users only, you CANNOT import data from any other Quicken version … you can only start a new file from scratch.<br /><br />I downloaded Quicken 2015 kicking and screaming because I had to, not because I wanted to. I was perfectly happy with the much cursed and maligned 2013 version (that finally was patched to the point of being okay) and after doing a clean restore of my computer in anticipation of WIN10 coming I found out that my 2013 disk was misplaced – likely accidentally included in a batch of stuff I had shredded recently. Knowing that Quicken comes out with their “new” version every year in September I hated the thought of paying full retail price in July for “last year’s” version (2015). I wouldn’t have bought any new version so soon if I still had 2013 available to use. And, Quicken being Quicken, I wasn’t able to use my backup files with the older 2011 version I still had.<br /><br />After installing 2015 Deluxe I can safely say I could not find one tangible change from the 2013 version I had been using. This is not just an unsubstantiated comment, I am very much a Quicken expert. I bought Version 1 on a 5.25” floppy disk directly from the original developer when it was first invented and I have used it non-stop since then.<br /><br />My install of 2015 should have gone smoothly, but no. While they haven’t done much to change it, they have done some subtle tweaks that ranged for me from minor irritations to some loud grrrr moments. The minor irritation came from version 2015 making the process of linking to my bank account to download transactions more complicated. I have no idea why but what used to be a one-step process took me almost 2 hours to set up and get working because it kept telling me my password was wrong (the same password it just accepted seconds earlier). It said it would send me an email to reset the password but after trying several times they never sent the email. Then they said that my bank locked me out after repeated attempts (my bank told me that was impossible, that the problem was with Quicken). I then bypassed Quicken's super-secure bullet-proof password safety features at the push of one button (something that a 98 year-old grandma hacker could do in 3 seconds and steal all of my data) and bingo I was in.<br /><br />The major frustration though came from some (unknown) reason that Quicken didn’t just download my bank’s transactions from the date I last used it, but instead felt it had to go back and re-download things that had already cleared and “rename” them. In doing so it left me with numerous duplicate entries and a lot of items lumped together with the same dates, as in several direct deposits from one source all dated the same day. What that did is left a whole series of red entries that shows as overdrafts. They never were, of course, but it made a mess of my meticulously maintained checkbook register that I had to go back over a 6-month period and re-enter manually item-by-item using my bank’s statements. It left a taste of what so many people have accused Quicken programmers of … living in dark cubicles, never using the product themselves in real life and having no clue the effects their little tweaks were having.<br /><br />I can’t downrate Quicken for me “losing” my 2013 version and having to buy a new one, or the fact that when 2016 comes out I won’t get a discount after only getting a couple of months use out of 2015. But I can downrate it because I didn’t get anything “better” than I already had, and the fact that the few minor tweaks they did do make my life harder, not easier.er a 6-month period and re-enter manually item-by-item using my bank’s statements.

Seemed fine till 2 days ago.<br />While chatting online with an Amazon Customer Service Rep. of all things it seems to have gotten hacked.<br />Every day after starting the PC it seems to be OK, but after 1st update of the day it will not open, The companion program reports that Mbam driver is present but turned off now. It re-enables the driver and does a scan. Mbam works for the rest of the day usually, but the process wastes 15 - 45 minutes and is a malicious wear of the hard drive too doing extra scans.<br />This is hardly the 1st time I have had an A/V itself hacked, at least it has companion software to help. With others you have to hope you can even get back online (probably unsafely) to root out the problem or re-install the A/V.<br /><br />If nothing else it is a solid reminder that nothing really protects you against determined attackers when online, all the A/V companies even admit it now.\n",

Today, I've used the new code only to find out that it has 359 days. As I mentioned before, several days is not a big deal, but this is wrong.

      "4\tJust moving over from Windows and am a longtime Quicken user who upgrades every year, so I’ve been using Quicken Windows 2015 until a couple days ago.  I’ve never extensively used many of the product features like reporting, budgeting, investment tracking, etc.  I primarily use it to download transactions, be reminded of and pay bills, and account reconciliation.<br /><br />When you first load up the Mac version, it’s initially confusing.  You have to install an app on your Windows device that exports your Quicken file into a format that can be imported into Mac Quicken 2015 — online account access doesn’t transition so well; all my accounts had to be redone for that.  It took several tries, as the option for Direct Connect doesn’t automatically appear as a choice so everything wound up as Quicken Connect.  The option to change to Direct is tucked away and took me a while to find.<br /><br />Once set up and syncing, accepting of transactions is a lot different than I was used to.  They’re in the register, with a check-mark which means it cleared.  If they’re newly downloaded, there’s a blue dot to the left that you click and select ‘reviewed’.  Jarring at first, but now I prefer it — more intuitive and faster.  The entire sync process is faster as well.  I do wish there was something in the account list that indicated new transactions for review, then I wouldn’t have to select each account to check.  Seems like a glaring omission.<br /><br />I knew prior to purchasing that there is no bill pay functionality in the Mac version, apparently something to be added later.  I’ve been using Prism bill pay on my iPhone for a while now and actually prefer it — bills are often paid within minutes of the transaction, and always at some point the day you initiate the bill payment.  With Prism, the due dates are based on biller data, and not what you’ve entered into Quicken as the due date.  This makes the lack of bill pay in Quicken less of an issue for me, but I can see how other users may be disappointed.<br /><br />Account reconciliation is a lot more forgiving in Quicken Mac.  Specifically, there are times when I know the online balance should be the same as what I show in the register, but for some mysterious reason they're different.  With Windows Quicken, I would have to create an adjustment for the amount and mark it reconciled.  With the Mac version, I can just adjust the starting balance in the reconciliation screen to bring the difference to zero.  Accountants might not like this method, but I do ;-)<br /><br />Overall, I like the program and think once they add bill pay, it’ll appeal to more people.ther users may be disappointed.

The dumb fellows don't realize that by zooming you lose a big portion of the frame wheras by adjusting aspect ratio and cropping ratios (like in VLC and other players) you can stretch the picture in video to fill the whole screen without missing any portion of the frame.<br />  I hoped that in one year they would be able to add this feature but it seems the staff is technically incapable at Cyberlink. So no upgrade for me.\n",

      "2\tThe program itself was good, easy to use, and I'll say better than Turbotax. Two problems however, first, according to the State of Pennsylvania, our return was incorrect and Pennsylvania sent me a check stating my return should have been higher than I claimed. Second, I opted to receive some of my Federal Return via a gift card through their 'get more refund' option. This has been a nightmare, nearly three months after I submitted my refund, the link they e-mailed me to claim my gift card states they cannot locate me as being a customer and/or having filed a claim. Therefore, I'm missing my money because they can't seem to recognize any of the information I used when I completed my taxes. I double and triple checked the information and cannot understand why they cannot find my information. To make matters worse, they only provide a phone number (no e-mail) for information, that number is an automated nightmare which so far, has not been able to help me.\n",

How do you know what it is really doing, how do you know if you really need it, and is it really better than the multitude of similar programs that are available for free?  I have friends who use nothing and have no complaints.  I have friends that have programs who get hacked.  It's all over my head.\n",

I need this for another computer known to be compromised with no internet connection because I am not letting it on my network until it is clean. So much for a simple download and installing it after purchasing the key. Instead I have to download an Amazon installer, then an Ninite installer on the computer that I want to clean. I had to disconnect all computers but one from the network. Now I have to scan that one as I had to connect the contaminated computer to the network to install it. This is a PAIN ... I should have gone to the store and purchased it there. I have done this with other software where I just download, copy to a USB drive and install it on another computer. +++ If this is the new normal for Amazon I will not be purchasing any other software for download. +++\n",

During install there's an option to change installation location to the Mac HD, but no choice of folder or anything else inside of it, so where they actually install it is a complete mystery. I retried downloading and installing it 6 or 7 times and the amount of available space on my HD stayed the same, so it appears they didn't even install anything at all period.\n",

      "3\tI bought this because we are going on vacation. In the weeks we're gone we'd like to have the main desktop protected in case thieves visit and they bypass our camera. If you have a desktop there is a problem with this &#34;solution&#34;. Most desktops are hardwired. When I installed it and checked my location it was off by 10-15 miles. A neighbor could steal my desktop and it would show their location in a different county. Might as well be a continent when you live in the mountains. It appears this is best for a laptop with wireless. It notes it triangulates via wireless hotspots. I guess if a clueless thief steals your &#34;wireless laptop&#34; and goes downtown near known hotspots you might catch em. If they do know about this advertised to death old technology and removes 2 screws on the bottom of your laptop and removes the wireless card before they boot up and remove the software you won't.  I bought an internal USB adapter. I will attach it to my motherboard and to a USB wireless dongle and see if that works. But I still don't see that's it's any use outside of a city. Recall the many limitations of wireless in even ideal conditions.\n",
      "1\tI have been using quicken for windows since 1999 and have always loved it. I just switched to a mac. This version of quicken is absolutely the worst program I have ever tried to use. My balance keeps changing. sometimes when I delete a transaction the balance doesn't change. I spent 3 hours trying to reconcile my checking account and finally had to give up.  Stay away from this program. Run the windows version on your mac or try  some other software.\n",
      "1\tI'm giving this product a 1 star review because it's absolutely absurd that there is no unsubscribe option to the spam that Norton starts sending you when your subscription expires.  Our company switched from this to BitDefender because we've outgrown Norton Internet Security, and ever since our Norton subscription expired (and leading up to it) they've been sending us warning e-mails telling us our subscription expired or was about to, and to renew.  The e-mails violate the law by not providing any unsubscribe option, logging into our profile there is no unsubscribe option, we've even used the unsubscribe tool that Norton has on a special page of theirs, we've e-mailed their technical support, and been on chat with their technical support, and been assured that we'd be unsubscribed from their spam, and haven't been.  And yes - the messages ARE from Norton.  It's not spoofed.  It references our license info, and message properties originate from Symantec.<br /><br />You can even look up what I'm complaining about on Google and see that this is a fairly widespread issue that people have been complaining about for years!  And they continue to do it.  It'd be nice if the federal government would enforce the law and hit them with some penalties.  I ended up just blocking their domain from e-mailing us anymore, and it's ridiculous that I've had to take this step to stop the spam.<br /><br />So ask yourself: do I want to do business with a company that will spam me when I decide to let my subscription expire?\n",

Quicken doesn't answer the phones on weekends either, so it is hard to get support.  Quicken has a monopoly on home finance software and apparently can make all Wells Fargo customers suffer because of some licensing issue...\n",

      "1\tI never write reviews but for this one I felt compelled to.  First I would like to say I have been using Quicken for Windows for the last 5 years and really thought it was a good product.  This past year I was forced to upgrade my Quicken product since they were no longer offering online transaction download support.  So I decided to try out the MAC version.  Every since the purchase, it has been a nightmare!!!  I followed Quicken's steps to convert my existing history and it totally screwed that up.  Come on now, you offer a converter app that just flat out is unacceptable.  I have spent weeks sorting out thousands and thousands of transactions in order to reconcile.  Just when I think I completed it, the app downloads a subset of the historical transactions from my online accounts again.  Are you kidding me!!!  This is by far the worst software product I have ever purchased but I am an idiot believing that I can somehow salvage this and make it usable.  I would never recommend this product to anyone!!!!!  Please do not even consider this until they actually commit to this product line and not try and rip potential customers off trying to pass this off as a real product.  Anyone who writes a positive review is either an employee of the company or has some type of vested interest.\n",

All I can say is that I am glad I did not buy the full version even on sale.\n",

      "1\tpretty much the worst POS of a software package I have used in 25 years of PC use. I'd take the freakin'  DOS version over this. Crashes at least once per session. Is there no competition for this program. Used 2012 until recently and it worked fine. Intuits forced upgrade policy is wrong. Also, what's up with keyboard shortcuts, one day they work, the next day they don't and the next day they work again. Aggravating product. UPDATE - it gets worse with each patch. CNTRL-F used to bring up the search window. Now it does nothing. Still crashes once or MORE times per session. Still garbage. Terrible software. Update - since this is the only player in the field, they have a captive audience. Today (several months after first review) NOTHING has changed. Says, we can't connect to your account because your password is wrong. Well, the password works just fine on the bank's website. And, when it generates that error, you have to end task and restart the program. Today it decided to stop talking to my Paypal account, so I have to enter transactions manually there..........it goes on and on.........terrible.\n",

      "2\tThe Infinite Kind developers must have done something right, because Moneydance imports data quickly and feels responsive in normal use.  The same data in Quicken Deluxe (on Windows) shows a spinning wheel for 5 seconds on every transaction entry; in iBank 5 (on a Mac) the import process takes ~60 times longer than Moneydance.  Those are the reasons that made me buy the program.  However: The main purpose of a personal finance manager is to track your accounts, and that's where Moneydance 2015.5 fails dismally.  It simply cannot track what bank downloads say.  Moneydance's idea of account balance is the initial balance plus transactions; this can easily get out of whack but Moneydance won't even tell you that there is a problem, let alone help you fix it.  You'll need to log into each account separately, note balances reported by your bank or brokerage, then verify that they match Moneydance reported balances (perhaps weekly).  This is not what I expected.  The problem is made worse if you own securities: manual tracking of balance discrepancies and manual fixes are needed for every account/security combination separately.  This is worse than balancing a checkbook based on paper bank statements.  As of 2015, Moneydance isn't capable of helping you track account cash and security balances for your online accounts.  So, I'm going back to my old Quicken for Windows.  It's slow, but at least it performs its prime function reasonably well -- Quicken for Mac 2015 doesn't.  UPDATE: Moneydance will report various account balances if you click on &#34;Balance: ...&#34; at the bottom right of an account screen, e.g. for checking this might be Balance, Cleared Balance, Current Balance, Confirmed Balance, Unconfirmed Balance, and Ledger Total.  From there, you are on your own.\n",

I do know that so far, (a few months) ,PC Matic has worked well and typical download averages are good. I also use the apartment's WiFi and it is not as fast as a homeowners private service. I know that the price was excellent and does what other services charge for about a third of the other services.

The reason I bought it in the first place was the comments on Amazon:<br /><br />Over the years I have tried several recipe programs, but they always came up short with ease of use and support, in fact I think they went out of business. There was a chance to buy an earlier version of this program for a great price and after reading a LOT of reviews on Amazon, I decided to try one more recipe program and am I glad I did. It was a great program that only seems to keep getting better with free upgrades and then after a year of two they have a full upgrade that does cost more money. I was very happy with version 10, but then a few problems cropped up and I contacted customer service. They not only got back to me with answers, it was done within 24 hours. Very consise and easy to follow. When they offered the free upgrade to using their cloud and syncing to my iPad and iPhone I jumped on it. The computer I use for all on the recipes is at my office so I would need to print any recipes I wanted to cook at home, but I could not get it to work so back to customer service. We tried several ways to get it to work, but to no avail. At this point they said they were aware of some problems and they were working on it, but if it would make me happy they would offer the upgrade to the newest version for a special price. I thought their offer was more than fair and I jumped on it that day. Unfortunely, it did not work either and I contacted customer service again, they replied in a few hours with a few more questions which I answered and in another hour they send a VERY detailed message that again was easy to follow and now it works great. I could not be more pleased with this product and how my problems were quickly solved in a professional manner. If you need/want a recipe program this is it.<br /><br />John\n",

I get it. Nobody works for free so this was not my reason for the 1 star. The 2015 version ruined my 8 year old data file. Some glitch or update changed my simple 3 letter password to something I couldn't recover even with the help of the password recovery tool provided by Intuit. I was able to restore an old backup but I lost a lot of current stuff that I had to re-enter. Now it locks up when trying to set up online access for my accounts. I have deleted everything and started over several times. I have spent many hours reading so many complaints from other users with the same problems. They are currently on revision 8 and none of them have corrected any of the issues I am having. I feel like an investor and a test dummy. Bring back my fully functional Quicken for revision 9!  UPDATE: 7/5/15 - THIS WILL BE MY LAST VERSION OF QUICKEN! The bugs keep coming but I will tell you what really works great... The advertising popup window every time I open the program. No matter how many times I uncheck the remind me later box. This is unacceptable! I paid for a fully functional program with no advertising for other Intuit products.\n",

I checked out their gallery of sites, and all had viewport settings that were fixed width of 900 to 1160 pixels.  Thus PC monitor size sites, which show the exact same way on mobile devices with the small print that you can barely see.  This software is not the right tool for what I need.  And too bad, I really like the look and ease of the interface, and it has good capabilities, including manual entry of html when you want to.

      "1\tI would say avoid at all cost, but, what is the alternative.  The new version suffers from feature bloat slowing it to a crawl -- especially when recomputing account and portfolio values.  Then, there is the online update feature.  On most days, Q2015 fails to perform, requiring two, three and sometimes even four attempts to grab security prices; in contrast, Q0212 never failed to perform flawlessly.  And, finally, Intuit wants your data in the cloud.  But I care not to have my financial life floating about in cyberspace.  There are hazards enough with just having it on a desk-top installation connected to the internet.<br /><br />For those new to personal finance software, my advice is, Explore the limited range of alternatives available.  Maybe there is one out there which will meet your needs.  For those of us, stuck with Quicken, I say, force Intuit to make Q2015 files backwards compatible with earlier versions.  And, yeah, to the suits at Intuit, I will pay an annual fee so I can download quotes and prices daily.  $12.95 per year seems fair.  I know you have bonuses to pay.

After discussing, when I upgrade I'm probably going back to Windows (sorry Apple, but your customer service was s***e), so opted for Quicken Deluxe 2015 for Windows. Plus, new mobile app option, yay!    I hate it. No keyboard shortcuts for updating accounts, no ability to enter multiple bill reminders/transactions all at once (I have to mouse click enter on each transaction, really?), no spending cloud making it easy to keep track of my budgets (I entered transactions at the end of each month to be like \\\\\"\"envelopes\\\\\"\" to take money out of, I never used the budgeting setup in Quicken Essentials).    And the real kicker... it looks/works/functions exactly as Mint seems to. And Mint is free. And I wouldn't have to steal time on SO's laptop to maintain it. And the Quicken app looks EXACTLY THE SAME as Mint's. For $50, I think I should get something other than Mint. The only thing this program has over Mint is the ability to enter bill reminders at all, but if I have to enter them each individually, I may as well use the free program.    Maybe I'm missing something, but I feel like if I've been using it for well over a week now and I still haven't figured out how to use the keyboard shortcuts, chances are pretty good the fault does not lie with me. I consider myself pretty tech savvy and I should not have to sit through google searches and help topics and tip videos to learn how to work the basic program.\"\n",

Isn't that intuitive?  Want to see the check and the itemized splits at the same time?  No longer possible.  The development team's guiding principle in &#34;improving&#34; this program seems to have been to transform any one-step action into a three- or four-step action, ostensibly to avoid cluttering up our little brains.  Unfortunately, even after familiarizing myself with the loony graphical interface that features endless nested features and commands clustered on the bottom of the window, it still takes me double the time to write checks in Quicken 2015 than it did in earlier versions.  Adding to these attractions, Intuit no longer offers telephone support for Quicken for Mac and the online &#34;chat&#34; is worse than useless.  Intuit's phone support for their other products features a whole lot of &#34;I'm sorry you're having this problem&#34; and very little knowledge about how to solve the problem.

I updated to the 2015 version and really didn't have any surprises. My one suggestion would be to lighten up the interface a bit. It feels a bit more sluggish than Norton and Avira, although it's on par with them for malware blocking and removal. If you are running Windows 7 or 8, there is really no need to pay for the more expensive Internet Security version, since Windows has a decent firewall built in, and a firewall is the primary additional component of Kaspersky Internet Security. (Also, most routers have an even better firewall already, which makes any other firewall redundant).  Overall, there are tons of good security options out there today; this is just one of them.\n",

I have aways used TurboTax deluxe But like many other faithful users, Intuit didn't care about customer loyalty or informing their customers about major changes related to deluxe. Talk about a total cluster on customer relations. I only fill out a tax return for my elderly Mother because she is required to attache it to her county property tax abatement form. She has no taxable income, so she is not required to file the return with IRS, but needs it for the county form. Now with the changes to TurboTax, if I need to put an amount on a schedule E for my Mom, I have to pay an additional $30 and upgrade. I only put the gross amount of rent on the Schedule E because it makes no difference in regards to taxable income, it is too low. So long story short, this was, and is the last year I will use TurboTax. Resides everything I cited above, your security is also lacking.

      "2\tMy Quicken data file got corrupted, so I'm starting a new one while keeping the old one limping along until the end of this year. I had long-since-reconciled transactions disappearing on me and many annoyances... isn't it yet another example of why a monopoly is usually bad?   Anyway, I got to try some of the &#34;let's get started&#34; features of the program, which I've not used in years and years. I'd like to say something positive, but this software makes me so cranky and irritable.  One major annoyance-- at least for me-- is that the default settings make for a lot of extra work on my part. While I was setting up my new Quicken file, starting from zero, the software would connect with the bank, or the credit card issuer, and it was downloading the last 90 days of transactions and automatically accepting them, and auto-categorizing them (90% wrong). So in other words, after it downloads all this, it presents me with register after register of transactions-- hundreds of them-- all of which need to be reviewed/edited one by one. What could be wrong with having the software ask the user &#34;do you want me to automatically download and categorize everything I can find when I connect to this site?&#34; How hard is that?  You may wonder to yourself, why didn't you just go into the preferences and toggle that &#34;auto-download/auto categorize&#34; feature off? Well, one of the downsides of using the program a certain way for years and years is that you have it set the way you want it, and the last time you dug around in the preferences/options was five or ten years ago. Kind of dumb, yes, but I can say the same to Intuit.  They should have an option that allows one to have the data file validated on a regular schedule. That would save some folks a lot of grief.   ===============================   Upgraded from Quicken Premier 2014. As with many reviewers, I am a long-time user, in my case since 1999.  On the whole, the software is more or less functional at trackingthe stuff most people track: paychecks coming in, have you scheduled that credit card payment, how are we doing with our budget, how much has that ETF investment appreciated, and so forth.  There are day-to-day operations which don't seem to be stable. I typically download transactions once each day, just to keep tabs on what's happening, and this crucial operation is very unstable. I have no idea what the root cause is, but we have a fast, reliable Internet connection (cable modem, 100Mbps down) and every day there is at least one or two downloads that generate errors. Most of these are transient; i.e., attempt the download again, and you often see different errors. I can't recall any past versions of Quicken that were as unstable in this way. I do have a decent number of accounts to download-- more than 20, let's say-- but it's not uncommon for me to do a download and get somewhere from 2-5 transient error messages: &#34;such-and-such an account couldn't download because there was error XYZ.&#34; Repeat the download, and sometimes some errors disappear, and sometimes not. It's so unpredictable.  Other oddball errors have happened: transactions disappear, long after being reconciled, the software can't remember payee accounts that have been used many times, and so on.  In a word, this software never gets polished and never functions as well as one might expect, given the price and the pressure to upgrade frequently. It's so unfortunate that there are no real competitor products.  I upgraded from Q2014 Premier because that software contained one very frustrating bug which prevented one from changing certain transactions: if you made a mistake with any kind of IRA-related transaction-- a download accepted into the wrong account, for example-- you could not delete or change the transaction. It became clear that Intuit was never going to fix that for Q2014 when they announced the new features for Q2015. So I cursed them and plopped down my money for Q2015.  Regarding the mobile app: I installed it on my iPhone and tried using it. I entered all my transactions while on a trip using the mobile app. When I came home and downloaded all of my inputs, Quicken created a duplicate account for one credit card and filled it with duplicate transactions. After cleaning up the mess, I stopped using the mobile app, as it was causing more problems than it solved.  Clearly there is plenty of room for improvement, and Intuit-- superficial replies to negative reviews notwithstanding-- seems to have little interest in substantive improvement.  I would like to see a truly polished, functional product with a reasonable annual subscription fee. I always maintain that one should never attribute malice when stupidity or other explanations will suffice, so I am not attributing malice to Intuit. Rather, their monopoly on this corner of the market has made them lazy and unresponsive to customer needs. That's why the majority of reviews here are 3 stars and below.\n",

(If I'd known if I could get it through Amazon, I would have done that in the first place, and then this would be a verified purchase!) I've used several of the programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Premiere) for ten to fifteen years. So when Adobe went to the subscription program... although I wasn't happy, I made the decision to stay with them. They're good programs, which is why I can't in good conscience give them less than three stars. They're all far from perfect, but then, nothing is. And yes, it's true that the $50 a month does cover almost *all* Adobe programs and does include a lot of updates, cloud storage, etc.<br /><br />HOWEVER... there's an elephant-in-the-living room enormous problem with the subscription plan for most of the people who actually use these programs. And it is so blindingly, glaringly, painfully, embarrassingly obvious!!! (Yes, it's bad enough to merit four adjectives in a row!) It's so frustrating and so hard to understand why this huge central problem is almost NEVER brought up or pointed out. The problem I'm talking about hinges on the fact that the overwhelming majority of all users are not professionals making a living with graphic design (or editing, or web pages, or whatever.) And this subscription model is only financially worth it for them. Nobody else. Let's look at the figures that prove this really is a fact.<br /><br />According to Adobe itself, the number of CC subscribers is now at over 4.6 million. http://prodesigntools.com/creative-cloud-one-million-paid-members.html<br />According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 259,500 graphic designers in the world who are actually making a living at their work. http://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm<br />From the same source, there are 49,500 film and video editors in the world, although this includes camera operators. Also, a lot of these are clearly using software their employer owns. There are 141,400 web developers and 68,900 multimedia artists and animators. (same story for them)<br /><br />Now let's get out the calculator...<br />(adding it all up)<br />518,900 living wage jobs.<br /><br />This is not a great way to figure out how many people are making anything like a living wage and using Adobe software that they themselves own and must pay for.  But we have to start somewhere. So let's go with it.<br /><br />4.6 million licenses of Adobe CC sold so far.<br />518,900  jobs that might use Adobe CC.<br /><br />This means that over FOUR MILLION of the licenses sold are used by people who are NOT MAKING MONEY by using this software. The VAST majority of all users are either hobbyists or people working seriously on personal projects that will never pay. I know people who fit into both of these categories who have been using the same releases of Adobe programs for literally *twenty years*. The idea that well over four million people using these licenses actually need constant updates, new versions every two years, every single possible program, etc etc etc., is somewhere between laughable and insane.<br /><br />And THIS is the real reason why there is a serious problem with the subscription model.  If you're really making a living (or anything close to it) by using Adobe CC software and the cloud, then it may work perfectly for your needs. For everyone else... that *four million* everyone else... there are some serious issues. I have decided to go with it anyway because I'm working on many personal projects, and three to six different Adobe programs are needed for each one. I don't like paying $600 a year to rent software, but it's a choice that I have made. My main worry is that Adobe really will decide to suddenly jack up the monthly price, and there's no way to know if they will. It's all still worth it to me, but I can completely see why everyone cannot say the same.<br /><br />And again... this central, key problem of hobbyists not needing all of the features, the problem which is so incredibly obvious once you look at the facts, is virtually never mentioned by anyone. I really wish that more people would start to discuss it.tral, key problem of hobbyists not needing all of the features, the problem which is so incredibly obvious once you look at the facts, is virtually never mentioned by anyone.

It would appear what it does is select the video on the disk with the longest runtime as what it will play when you hit play on its home made menu. The only real issue with this is if the disk has more than 1 copy of the movie, like rated or unrated, or if you enjoy watching the extras stuff like deleted scenes as you can select the different videos on the disk but they only are listed as runtimes so there is no telling what you are selecting.<br />This isnt really an issue for me since i have 2 other devices that can play blu-ray, ps3 ps4, and if i really needed to see extras or choose what version i want to watch id just go to the tv they are hooked up to or bring them to my living room, but it is worth mentioning as the extras are important to some people\n",

After struggling repeatedly to convey the key, a mixed 25 digit alpha-numeric code, he finally got it right, then told me that he would connect me with someone who would guide me through the operation (!).  When I reached that person - (you guessed it) - I had to repeat the key ID again on the same merry-go-'round.

I normally go with HR Block just because it is what I have known, but I recently had to do a return from a few years ago, and their prices were outrageous.  I decided to give this a try.  I first downloaded the free copy to see what I was getting into.  To make sure the user interfaces are ok, questions are complete, etc, before I bought anything.  I am self employed so I have to have the fancier ones with schedule c.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how thorough and easy to use it is.  Someone on another review (maybe even for another year's software) that the graphics look like it was made in the 90s.  I wouldn't say it looks that old, but it's not super fancy.  It is easy to use, and it's really not as ugly as other people make it sound, but it is fairly utilitarian.<br /><br />One thing I liked a lot better than HRblock is that the back button goes back to each question.  In HRB if you hit the back button it takes you back to the beginning of the interview section.  That part of hrb was so frustrating, and this software was much better.<br /><br />I think it works just as well, if not better than the others.  For the record, I really don't like TT.  If you have simple returns, try the free stuff.  If you have to buy the fancier ones, at least download the free to check it out, and then buy the bundle.\n",

I have to re-set up each time I use it and work off of the prior days back up file.  it has caused my many problems and much money.  Do not upgrade.\n",
      "1\tThe program have been fine. What wasn't fine was the part that the program I bought was a non upgradable version meaning I had to buy a separate portable hard drive, save my current drive to it, and THEN install Windows 7 or else all of my files would be wiped away during the upgrade. Would have been nice to know that before I bought it.\n",
      "3\tThe negative reviews here don't seem to be from long time users; this program always had a rather steep learning curve.  You always had to spend time learning it.  I went from Poser Six (of Curious Labs), to P 9 (of Smith Micro--it changed ownership), and it's like going from driving a ten year old car to a new one, in one swoop.  There are the new Diffuse IBL lights, and subsurface scattering , for example.  It pretty much performs the same, but there are drawbacks...the native figures are less than exemplary, compared with P 6's...they went down a notch there.  I don't care so much, I use DAZ's characters.  You have to hit &#34;save&#34; often if you don't want it to hang.  And even with the quad core computer I have, and 8 gigs of RAM, it doesn't cooperate well if you load your scenes down with figure morphs and a lot of detail. (I believe it can only &#34;see&#34; about 2-3 gigs of RAM.)  I also have Poser Pro 2010 but don't use it much, so I don't know if it's a cut above this. Pluses, it's customizable  and it would seem you can build a huge library of add-ons--figures, morphs, lights, etc..  And yes, If you also own Vue software, you can export figures to the scenery building capability of that program.  (though Vue is even more of a bear to learn.) Get a good book or two and take time to learn it, because with what you CAN do with it, you'll have fun. I just wish they'd come up with better figures than the Curious Labs version, AND hope someday they can simulate collisions a bit better. So all in all, for me anyway, it's better the devil you know than the one you don't and I just can't see spending the outrageous amounts of money they want for other, similar programs.  If you want to go to CGI movie land, this is not the way to go. BTW, artists, if you find paying for models expensive and potentially troublesome, this is one way to go...Poser models don't get tired or slouch, so you can leave them where you put them and draw or paint referring to your computer screen, with traditional media...:)\n",

      "1\tUnable install  on my MacBook.  I ordered as a download vs physical disc b/c of a deadline / needed urgently.  I downloaded the file about 7 times with various methods including Amazon Downloader, and direct links w/ Chrome + Safari (1.9GB each time).  In each case, I received 'invalid checksum' upon verification.  I turned off checksum warnings via Disk Utility and then got &#34;We've encountered the following issues -- installer failed to initialize. This could be due to a missing file.&#34;  error.  I researched the issue in great depth on both the adobe forums and w/ general searches.  I tried about everything any tech support service could offer while in good faith I went to Adobe chat.  It  was hosed and the software felt awkward.  Finally I got through to an agent and after providing exhaustive detail he wanted to do a 'remote control' operation where they can view my screen to solve the problem.  That's when I decided to pull the plug and cut my losses; After about 5-10 hours of research/ downloading etc.. I called Amazon (on the phone w/ live nice talking humans!) and in about 3-5 minutes they offered me a special case refund on games/software downloads as a courtesy.  I've been a loyal Adobe and Amazon customer for most of my life.  Amazon did a good job of basically cleaning up Adobe's mess this time.  It's mind-boggling, to me at least, that in 2015 a giant like Adobe can't make a download work properly and easily (I'm certainly not the only one with this check-sum problem.)  Also Adobe's chat help, while well intentioned, felt unresponsive. In the future I can't imagine ever paying up front  for an Adobe download -  maybe a trial and pray it installs or just order the physical disc.  ps.

      "1\tI purchased this program online from a link on Amazon for Avangate for a very good price. Unfortunately, when I purchased the product the licensing key that makes the fully functional 30-day trial version a year long subscription was not sent until 3 days later. Most normal download purchases with other companies are sent within minutes, most at the same time as the purchase confirmation email, an issue that I've never had with anyone else. I had to call PayPal and Avangate because at first I thought I'd been had, they claimed to have sent the key to one address and then I had it resent to an alternate one. When the licensing key finally arrived it didn't work and I was directed to call Bitdefender's pleasant customer service, some guy name Dan with a thick accent. Bitdefender said that the call to Avangate and PayPal created a &#34;chargeback&#34; forcing them to make the licensing key non-functional and to forward emails from myself, PayPal and Avangate, then the licensing key would be reactivated or a new one issued from Avangate. Once again, about a week after purchase, Avangate sent the same non-working license key, claiming that everything was settled. I received a letter from Bitdefender later asking me to forward emails between myself PayPal and Avangate, even a screenshot of my banking statement as proof of the purchase and proof that the purchase had no ongoing (chargeback) issues, which I sent, not showing account numbers, of course. How much more am I expected to send to prove my purchase?<br /><br />Well, as of this writing I still have no license key for Bitdefender, working or otherwise. It's a good thing that their trial version is fully functional or I'd be without protection for nearly a week. What I've seen of the product looks okay and it seems to work, but I'm not getting comfortable into it until all issues are settled and the purchase complete, which doesn't seem to be in the near future. No matter how good the software is, it's just not worththe trouble just from the initial purchase and the untrusty way they deal with customers. Bitdefender apparently does not communicate or communicate well with their sellers or customers and with that poor communication just over transactions it doesn't speak well for the company for other issues, like technical, should any happen. Bitdefender needs to get their act together and brush up on people skills to get customers to return. This will definitely be my first and last purchase of Bitdefender or any software through Bitdefender, Avangate or anyone else who sells it. Take my word, look into other software and save yourself major headaches.\n",

      "3\tThis is the industry standard. It's probably the best screenwriting software out there, not because it's really that good, but because there's just a dearth of resources available. Celtx has many glitches--I've experienced losing my saved files, unable to save to the right file, and unable to open the most recently saved version. It's just a mess. And don't even try writing a script with Word. You might as well try to open a beer bottle with a shotgun.  Final Draft is better than all of them. It is stable. It's user friendly and has a very small learning curve. But from time to time it'll act like a recalcitrant child and only wants to do things its way. For instance, the auto formatting function has its pros and cons. It makes your script look professional, but there are lots of irritating problems. Like you can't add an extra empty line between lines: if you press Enter you bring up the Element box. Also when you finish typing a character name and want to add parentheses, you can't just manually type them in, you have to bring them up from the drop down menu, otherwise Final Draft treats it as dialogue and when you press Enter it defaults to Action. The save PDF function is just broken: if you've already saved a draft and then want to overwrite it, you can't, you have to change the file name or delete the previous file first; even that sometimes doesn't work, for reasons I've never been able to find out. Using it I get the feeling that whoever programmed it is probably not a real programmer, because these things are so easy to fix.

The only serious flaw I don't like is that often when I switch from &#34;manage&#34; to &#34;Adjust&#34; to &#34;Edit&#34; modes I end up losing my edits because it has switched me back to the original photo rather than the one I was editing in another mode!<br /><br />Context sensitive help is very good. (Select a tool and over on the right it tells you a little about how to use that tool)  There is a steep learning curve to learn where to find the various tools and how to use them.  Once you understand them they generally work extremely well.\n",

      "1\tI wanted to convert my Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file to Quicken for Mac 2015.  Intuit/Quicken instructions say I must first &#34;convert&#34; the Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file to a format that Quicken for Mac 2015 can read.  This task is accomplished with a program called Quicken Converter for Mac 2015 that converts the Quicken Windows data file from a x.QDF format to a x.QXF format.  Quicken for Mac 2015 requires the data file be in a x.QXF format in order to import the data file.  I downloaded the Conversion Utility Tool from the Quicken website to my Windows XP computer and installed it.  It is named QuickenConverter.exe, version 24.0.0.363, dated 4/6/2015.  My computer is running Windows XP SP3 32-bit.  My Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file contains over 10 years of data, but my investment data starts in September 1980.  Before I started the conversion I brought all of my data up to date and then &#34;validated&#34; it making any noted corrections.  I then made a copy of the data file that I would &#34;convert&#34;.  I then removed all passwords from the &#34;copy&#34; of the data file. After doing all this I launched the Quicken Mac 2015 Conversion program (QuickenConverter.exe) and selected the Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file that I had made a copy of.  The conversion program runs a short time and then Windows displays this message:  &#34;QuickenConverter has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience&#34;. So I tried the same process on my laptop which is running MS Windows 8.1 64-bit.  I got the same result.  I googled to see if anyone else was having the same problem.  Yep, it's a known issue and Quicken hasn't fixed it.  I reluctantly dialed the Quicken Contact Us number 888.311.7276 for help expecting a long wait that turned out to be about 15 minutes.  The Quicken representative listened to my problem and concluded that she could not help.  She was referring my case to the Quicken Data Research Team for resolution.  They would send me an email on how I could upload my Quicken Windows data file and they would convert it for me.  I received the email which stated, &#34;We have received your case about converting your data from Quicken for Windows to Quicken for Mac 2015. Your case was escalated because you no longer have a Windows computer available to complete the conversion.  NOTE: If you do have a Windows system available, please visit http://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/GEN86441.html for information about how to convert your data file.&#34;  I never told the Quicken representative that I no longer had a Windows computer!!  I clicked on the link and it is the same link that I used to download the QuickenConverter.exe.  Further down in the Quicken email was another link to facilitate the transfer of my Quicken data file to the Quicken mothership for conversion.  I clicked on https://filefix.intuit.com/global.  The site asked that I enter the case #, my email and a PIN.  All this information was in the Quicken email I had just received. I entered the information as required and the website promptly replied incorrect information.  I clicked on the help and it said to call the Quicken Contact Us number, the number I had called earlier, in order to get a new PIN.  I called and this time the computer said my wait would be 45 minutes.  While waiting for a Quicken representative I started penning this customer review.  About 30 minutes into my wait the phone went dead.  I then decided I was through wasting my time with Quicken and would request my money refunded (60-day money back guarantee).  I had downloaded the Quicken for Mac 2015 from Quicken about 25 days ago, so no problem.  Wrong!! Wrong!! Wrong!!.  Since it was downloaded, Quicken requires me to call them to obtain a refund.  You guessed it-- the same number which I just called and which self terminates after one waits about 30 minutes.  The bottom line.  Download QuickenConverter.exe and try to convert your Quicken data file first.  If you are successful, then proceed to purchase Quicken for Mac 2015.  One last comment.  I tried iBank.  The conversion went very smooth.  iBank requires one to export the the Quicken Windows data file to a x.QIF.  Very easy.  Then import this file to iBank.  Unfortunately, I could not use it because iBank does not support Tag categories.\n",
      "1\tThe only reason I purchased this software was because I needed it for a class. As someone who regularly tracks their foods and exercises through a Garmin vivofit, myfitnesspal, and mapmyrun, I find this software very outdated and not very user friendly. Majority of what I eat, I make myself and it takes so much longer to creat &#34;custom foods&#34; than the other fitness trackers. Plus it is annoying to reenter things that I have already entered in a different application. I wish that there was a way to connect other fitness apps to this software. I understand that this software makes it easier for professors to look at what we are eating/doing, but as a student it is painful to deal with entering data into this software. Oh! And I almost forgot: the calorie calculation is wrong. It said that I need 2000 calories a day. I've calculated my basal calorie consumption before and with my general activity level, I should be consuming about 1,530 calories a-day plus whatever activities I do during the day. My rant is over now. Unless your professor requires that you use this, don't waste your time nor money on this subpar software.\n",

      "1\tMinus two stars is what I would give it if I could.  Video glitches make it unusable, forced registration with Intuit (i.e. junk mail you don't want) just to TRY to use it. Waste of time and money.  I should have paid more attention to the other negative reviews, but I just wanted minimal functionality (budgeting & expense tracking) without all the fancy internet data downloads.  Nope, it won't even do that since it uses input screens that are mostly invisible/unusable.  I think I have an OLD version (from about 20+ years ago) that worked for what I need, so I'll try to find a backup copy of that.  The money and time I spent on Quicken 2015 was a complete and total waste.\n",

WIthout the password, of course, the update will not proceed. I'm stuck.<br /><br />This appears to have not been very well tested. Disappointing\n",

      "3\tIntuit, the maker of TurboTax, is quickly moving to the Cloud, which is probably a good decision. Unfortunately, the price of the PC TurboTax Business software remains high regardless of the complexity of your tax situation. Nevertheless, buying the business (corporate) version is cheaper than paying a tax accountant to file for you. As a corporation owner, you have to decide if potential tax savings found by an accountant warrants paying $800 in lieu of tax software. The software program leads you through your tax situation step-by-step, but make sure you have your QuickBooks and spreadsheets ready or you'll spend unwarranted time completing the 1120S for an S-Corp return. Corporate state tax returns are another $50, as you find out later after completing the Federal return. That raises the total price for TurboTax Business to $160-$170 since software discounts on this version are rare online or from Intuit. Unlike other software companies, Intuit doesn't offer a discount for an &#34;upgrade&#34; version each year. Anyone using Intuit's QuickBooks software to prepare for TurboTax should seriously look at the online versions; monthly and yearly pricing for keeping track of income and expenses seems easier, although QuickBooks online, as well as Quicken for Home and Business, continue struggling downloading accurate PayPal transactions. Other online financial service firms, such as Wave Accounting, work much better with PayPal. I continue hoping that competitors will challenge Intuit's dominance of the tax return software market.\n",

The download went smoothly and Outlook 2013 performs as promised, along the lines of the mediocre reviews I had already read.  But the software sync never worked and I no longer need or want Outlook 2013 (in fact, the installation installs an Office 2013 shell which renders my MS Word 2007 incompatible -- but there's an awkward workaround for this).<br />Bottom line, I would like to return this and don't recall being advised that it is non-returnable.  So I'm stuck with useless and nonreturnable software (I went back to Outlook 2007 to avoid the MS Word hassle).

I no longer need this program, but if I ever did, I know I could use it again.<br /><br />The date that it did return were some voice files deleted, as well as text messages, pictures, etc... some of the data was easier to wade through than others, but oh well.\n",

      "1\tI rarely feel strongly enough about products to come write a review, but after the umpteenth random crash, I've decided to come in here and join the masses.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a very sub-par piece of software that takes what should be a reasonably straight forward exercise of compiling information and turns it into a perpetually crashing, error prone piece of garbage.<br /><br />I use this software mostly just to automatically collect and store transactions from a variety of investment accounts; I don't require the advanced features of the budgeting or break-downs by category, so I am unable to review these features. Unfortunately, this program is the only game in town that I know of that easily logs into each account and obtains the information, but even this is very hit-or-miss (especially at Vanguard, where I constantly must re-enter dividend information that never makes it into Quicken).<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade to 2015 via Quicken's 'forced obsolescence' business model of perfectly good Quicken 2012, which meant it would no longer obtain market quotes etc for my portfolio. So basically, I'm forced to shell out money every 2 years for a program just to keep functionality alive. Which wouldn't be so bad, if the new program could actually do all of the same things the original did without crashing.<br /><br />This version is simply garbage. It constantly tries to update itself and fails, it constantly freezes, randomly crashes to desktop, and lags out at performing the most mundane of calculations. Really, grouping investments based on investing goal and running an IRR should not cause a fatal error, especially as this software is 20 years old...<br /><br />Its honestly so terrible that I think it has convinced me to finally pull the plug. I think I will just build some spreadsheets that take my electronic statements and aggregate it all.<br /><br />I have no faith that all of my transactions have been successfully transferred from my investment accounts, I don't trust many of the calculations I do see (unless they are the most simplistic of Sell/Buy), and I'm tired of constantly crashing.\n",

You simply drag the file from a folder or the desktop into the input window of Movavi, click one drop down to select the new format to convert to, and another to tell the software to put the new video, hit &#34;convert&#34; and that's it.  It's fast too! It automatically selects the best method of hardware acceleration, and it typically converts a full length feature film in less than 5 seconds.<br /><br />If it was only a video converter, this software would be excellent and well worth the money. However it does much more. You can trim videos to get rid of unwanted scenes, and convert most video formats to MP3 or M4A audio. This is all included with the Movavi Video Converter for the purchase price without having to buy Movavi's audio or video editors. This video converter really shines when converting FLV flash video to MP4.<br /><br />My first use of the product was to download an FLV (with permission) of my son's HS graduation from the school website (using the shareware Video Downloadhelper add-on for fire fox), and cleanly and instantly converting it with Movavi to MP4 to play on my Kindle, tablet, phone, etc, and then using the video trimming feature to cut it down to the parts where he was actually onstage, for posting to facebook, youtube, etc.<br /><br />My only bad experience so far has been converting a large number of files at once and having the new videos skip and jump in a very irritating way. I didn't mark the software down for this, because I believe it was a function of my small Video RAM, and it never happened again when converting just two or three files at a time.\n",

Overall I think Quicken is a useful tool to see all my money in one place, I think there may be some better features on this but I haven't taken the time to play with it.  I did have to look hard to find this at what I consider a decent price - I think the retail price is high and makes it inaccessible to a world that desperately needs it.\n",
      "5\tBeing an system engineer, I didn't look forward to reading the owner's manual because checking out the chapters look like it would take a lot of investment in time just to get the basic concepts.  However, thanks to a great YouTube video, I was able to start making movies in just over an hour using the basic concepts.  And when one grasp the concepts of anything the rest is down hill.  I right now don't know if it's this is best but I am satisfied that I can make movies with what I believe is fantastic editing with better things to come when I get a better understanding of the software.\n",

      "2\tThis was the first year that I was disappointed with Turbo Tax.  Classifying the software as NOT user friendly, I found its newly added steps confusing and difficult to navigate.  For instance, the software does not ask the right questions to properly compute the new health insurance costs or problems  through healthcare.gov. In addition, I found its new program to handle Schedule C for small businesses as cumbersome and difficult to correct. The software's glitches did result in miscalculated taxes for 2014.\n",
      "1\tGood luck with syncing accounts converted from previous Quicken version file. The online option sucks. Now, I have to remember two passwords, and on line sync of accounts fails more often than not. Then it constantly asks you to deactivate your accounts from online sync and reactivate. That does not work either. It won't deactivate. Utter s***.\n",

In the view screen, the video freezes up It will play for about 5 seconds and the video will freeze up. I have multiple crashes when editing video. I actually bought a new laptop (Lenovo) 8 gigs to make sure I have enough &#34;juice&#34; to edit videos and per my cpu every time I  edit video it uses up utilization of over 80 percent of processing, which is why I think the reason for the sudden crash. To give you an example I use to use Go pro studio on my old laptop and it didn't perform well. Now with the new laptop with the higher processing, gopro studio works fine. I don't want to use Gopro studio as my main editing software, it has huge limitations but seems to work. PD 13 is the worst $60 I spent in a long time.\n",
      "5\tI have been using PC Matic on five PCs for over a year now. The virus protection which is unique with Super Shield does appear to be bullet proof as advertised. So far, I have not experienced any serious threats during this past year while relying on this product. I have 8 computers on my home network and am sad to say that some of the big name virus protection programs have really let me down in the past, allowing problems to consume way to much of my time.  My observation, however, is that there are some free utilities that seem to do a little better with some of PC Matic's extra features. They are Slimdrivers, CCleaner and Malewarebytes to name a few.  This product almost never finds driver updates, while the free utility Slimdrivers has found dozens, although not all were perfect. Sometimes installing new drivers will open Pandora's box and a user must know how to recover or roll-back the bad installation. So I can understand why each minor upgrade to these many drivers is not automatically jammed into your system. But, I'm still waiting for any major driver updates like those that I have had to fish out from support sites to be found by PC Matic.  There are a lot of statistics presented in a summary which means absolutely very little if you have multiple computers. Nothing is linked in the summary to allow easy access to the health or details of your multiple systems that are networked. Report pages should be accessible from this point. The summary seems to blindly tout this program's performance and to give the user a warm fuzzy feeling.  With that said, I would still recommend this product to my friends on the basis of virus protection alone..\n",

      "1\tNot adding much that hasn't been said above. Just a bit about my experience:<br /><br />When I started with Amazon Cloud, they had an app that let you keep a folder on your computer up to date with your Amazon Cloud storage. Simple and easy. Works on a Mac, works on Windows, even works on things like tablets. That's just like Dropbox, Google and several others. I rumbled along not paying a lot of attention to changes. Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.<br /><br />Is there a gotcha with the &#34;sync&#34; approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.<br /><br />Any bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the &#34;Unlimited Everything&#34; plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage? Unless they come up with a sync solution, I would avoid using their service. It's just not as useful as some of the others.<br /><br />Why *would* I use their service? About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys. They might hit the backups as well as your main disk. It might work when the whole town and every computer in it goes under water.\n",
      "1\tHadn't updated the Quicken I had been using since 2004 but had to when the old computer crashed and had to install a new OS and couldn't read the old one.

Might as well just do it in Excel for all the use this junker of a Quicken is.\n",

Honestly, even though Turbo Tax is not the most amazing product ever, I definitely like it a lot better. I almost gave up and bought Turbo Tax again but I powered through. Ended up being okay just not as sleek.  So if you're looking to save some cash then I'd get this.  If you can afford a different solution, then I'd go for that. I'll probably not be getting this software again in the future. It works and it's fine just not awesome.\n",

I was eager to purchase the 1-year subscription the day the trial expired, but something pressing came up so that changed my plan.  I wish I had been able to make my purchase that day because when I checked the next day, the purchase price had been substantially increased (which I find unfair).  The only other complaint I have is that I fail to see the reason I am prohibited from using my reward points to purchase this item.  My balance of points is more than ample enough to cover the cost.\n",

However, Cyberlink's tech support is practically impossible to work with. There is no phone support and the email support is extremely slow in responding. That's not the worst part. They require more information in these ensuing emails than an IRS audit. No one in their right mind would spend hours replying to all their demands.

The guitar riffs are very basic and extremely out dated. For it to be &#34;metal&#34;, it has very little in the metal genre, unless you're looking to sound more of an 80's big hair band.  Even then, you're better off finding a guitarist or learning guitar yourself.<br /><br />I was hoping to be able to use some of these samples instead of me having to break out my gear from storage and playing it all myself. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough on here to work with, so I had to anyway. Not impressed, especially since it was $70. I've purchased better sample collections for 1/3 the price of this.\n",

But, I ended up doing a manual return and losing out on the fee I'd paid because the program was too time consuming and frustrating.  First, you can't get a look at the 'big picture,' as you fill out the forms.  You can only see the Taxact pages, with their boxes for entries.  If you want to preview a pdf of the whole form, as you go, you have to pay extra.  Second, it would timeout and log me off, again and again, even though a pop up would appear and let me say that I wanted to stay logged on.  Then, I'd have to go back to the beginning. which was the worst part, because about half the time it would drop my info and give me all blank screens.  The first time that happened, I emailed for support, but I never received a reply.  At the end, you can get a pdf of the completed 1040, but not of any of the schedules - again. that's an extra fee.

Once with the Deluxe 2015 and now with the Starter 2015.<br /><br />I am running Windows 7 ... Quicken DOES NOT WORK! I've installed and uninstalled both versions of Quicken several times and it DOES NOT WORK! When going through the install process the program wants to &#34;update&#34; - it never completes ... get to the Task Manager, says its running, but when you try to stop it, the message then says that has stopped working. So, try the install and bypass the update ... Great, I was able to open Quicken only to get the password page (top screen shot in the photo). There is no password, I never created a password, you cannot recover a password. There is an endless loop (the second screen shot in the photo), Inuit help IS NO HELP! Even if you are lucky enough to talk with someone who can speak English, they are no help. The best advice I got from Intuit help was that they know there is a problem and they are working to fix it. They've been working since the end of April - apparent this is problem that can only be solved by the builders of the Pyramids.<br /><br />Almost forgot this important item - I lost all of my Quicken data and had to uninstall the 2012 version.<br /><br />Once again I will be requesting an immediate refund. Silly me - fool me once, fool me twice ...<br /><br /> *** By the way, this is not a negative against AMAZON.

It will tell you when something needs to be done.  There is system optimization that will clean up and defrag hard drives.  It can recognize the difference between hard drives and solid state drives (if you are on Window 7 or later) so it handles them appropriately.  Another nice feature is a history screen that lets you know when computer events took place.  i.e. downloads, virus scans, detection of issues, etc.  You can click on an event and see the details of what it recorded.  I have used Norton quite a few years on several computers and have never had a virus issue on any of my computers.  This version does a lot more in total system maintenance and is a good buy.\n",

      "1\tBAD, VERY BAD, AND WORSE THAN VERY BAD PURE UGLY - I bought Bitdefender 3PCs/2Years from Amazon, originally to get rid of products like it. And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.  Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered.  Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.  Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it wouldn't uninstall.  When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads. Your computer, your choice.   Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible. Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?  Please send them to albackus@gmail.com. Today is July 4, 2015. I’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. UPDATE Today is July 17, 2015.  No word yet.   Amazon, are you listening?\n",

You will have to call QuickBooks Payroll  Support (866-293-1928) and give them a credit card number for payroll service before they will issue you an activation key.. The payroll service is designed to bill you automatically for each additional employee per month (around $2/ea) and at the end of one year, will renew your payroll subscription to the cost of approximately $411. The customer service representative assured me that she had to have the card number first and that she would cancel the subscription immediately if I didn't want the additional services / renewal but there is no way to activate payroll feature without first giving a credit card number.\n",

      "3\tWell I'm writing this with the Dragon software I'm not to make any corrections on this first one want to see what it looks like after reading it and then I'll do a correction underneath it so you can see the difference I've had this for over six months now and I use it not everyday but occasionally.. That makes a difference because of the training that's involved in word accuracy. I found that if you make the sentences shorter or stop in the middle of the sentence it's more accurate. Now my first experience with the download and installation of this program on my desktop Windows 8.1 was a disaster I ended up having to do a full refresh on my computer because of what Dragon did to it. But, I was determined to have Dragon software on my computer so I went ahead and installed it again once I got my computer back to running normal again I know why would I do that again well I figured I could just corrected again if I ever got messed up again but this time but this time it downloaded and installed perfectly fine and my computer is been perfectly fine since the Dragon program seems to work really good for me the accuracy isn't too bad. Would I recommend getting this program? Absolutely not I tried putting it on my laptop after it went on my desktop successfully and it messed that up to I'm going to do another refresh on the laptop this time it seemed to make a big difference with my desktop when I did it then. But I am no way going to put the Dragon software on the laptop. So on my desktop with Windows 8.1 and not a very good system only paid about $350 for the tower but the Dragon software works pretty well on it. There's definitely some lag that occurs I use it sometimes with this chat program called Paltalk of course you have to wear headphones with a mic or else it will start typing what everybody else is saying to. As I said this program gets more more accurate the longer you use it so don't expect it to be accurate right away I use it occasionally and have been for about six months, two months ago it was not this accurate. They say talk naturally and useful sentences but I really have found saying just three or four words at a time it's a lot more accurate. Now I said I'm going to rewrite all this without the mistakes but I'm seeing that there's so few of them I'm just going to keep it like it is and let you judge its accuracy. I guess that's all.<br />6\\6\\2017: update<br />I don't know how many people have read this review thinking this guy who wrote this must be blind. Because now when I read this most of it of the sense. Just to let you know I have updated my Dragon have been using Dragon professional version 15 and in fact I'm using it right now to dictate this comment I'm also on Windows 10 and that made a big difference to if you don't mind spending about 300 bucks Dragon 15 Is Way Way better right now I'm in about the 4th week of training this version of Dragon and it's been absolutely flawless. It installed with absolutely no problems all I highly recommend this version of Dragon.about six months, two months ago it was not this accurate.

I also loaded on out laptops.<br /><br />I assumed it would be like dropbox or google and sync my files, but it dumps everything into one folder,  It also will not completely upload from one of my computers, and it appears that it is duplicating all of my pics each time I start over.  I have 8 full size copies of some pics on my cloud drive now. I signed up for the unlimited plan trial so space isnt an issue, but the way this is going I will be cancelling unless the ease of use and expected functionality greatly improve. It would also be nice to be able to share multiple pics with one link, but there is a separate link per photo, and the links dont have thumbnails...so after you share something, you can see all of the links to your shared pics and delete them one by one of together, but you have no idea what link corresponds with what photo.  Amazon can surely figure this out!\n",

The answers to problems that I do find don't work. Even their process for  requesting a refund does not work!<br /><br />They very, very obviously do not spend enough time testing their software. My guess is that they're pressuring their software developers to get things done quickly so that they can get the next version out.<br /><br />I've very frustrated and angry. If you're a old Quicken user like my my very sincere advice is to stay on you're older version, unless of course, you enjoy being frustrated and angry like me.<br /><br />(Refund Info)<br />If you did make the tragic mistake of purchasing Crapken 2015 you can create a PDF of your Amazon receipt and email it to: ereturns@intuit.com and ask for a refund (&#60;60 days) but I'm betting that is a problem too.\n",

This software is ridiculously ineffectual. The tutorial is all of 5 minutes...........but the things brags about how it has an ENDLESS amount of possibilities. This is confirmed if you want to print their actual instruction manual.Some of us like to have something solid on hand that we can flip through, not a screen to scroll down. The manual is very easy to find and print. All TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX PAGES OF IT.<br />I was skeptical as to how precise this software could actually be but figured that there ARE a lot of smart folks in the world designing these things. I should have listened to myself. The repeating yourself and constant leaning forward or adjusting yourself to use the keyboard and mouse make it an awkward and frustrating experience from the start. Frustrating to the point that you don't even WANT to get your work done. You just want to get up......................drop the terribly cheap headset..............and walk away before your $100 software causesyou to smash a $1,400 laptop against the wall.\n",

When I went back to the Norton site to reinstall the software, I got the runaround from their pages and links. Basically, they did not recognize the new operating system, even though it was the same motherboard. I was under the impression that since it was the same device, it would just reinstall, but obviously that is not the case. However, while getting shuffled around the Norton pages, I realized that it was an automatic renewal after a year. I disabled that of course, since I do not even now have it.

      "4\tI've found this software to be more than adequate for editing my photography, which is a hobby of mine that I've had for a few years now. I'm certain that there are other programs that are &#34;better&#34; in some aspects but PaintShop has been the most advanced program I have invested in thus far. Previously I was using Smart Photo Editor because of it's very low pricing but the overall quality of a finished product was really no good. Even when maximizing the quality of the image based on it's provided scale, it would be less than pristine and I was not settling for that. Even after purchasing this I continue to use PortraitPro 12 for all of my fashion or model based photography. Now, allow me to break down this software for you a little so you can get a better understanding of how it works!<br />There are three main tabs at the top of the opened software page; Manage, Adjust, Edit. Each of which I will highlight and give a pros and cons rundown of.<br />:Manage:<br />This tab allows you to &#34;quickly&#34; search through the folders of your computer in order to select the right photograph or group of photographs for editing.<br />Pros -<br />1.) There are thumbnails that give you a preview in the center of the screen after you open up a particular folder that allows you to quickly preview the photographs in the album.<br />2.) The right side of my set up I have the info widget that gives you a detail rundown of the file properties and the camera data that goes along with it. This is very helpful when considering maximum file size for site uploads before editing.<br />3.) The bottom left of my screen I have a preview widget with helps me to determine which specific shot I am looking at if I took multiple of the same thing.<br />Cons -<br />1.) Really the only con to this tab is the Navigation widget, because it isn't the best organized and it's ultimately easier, in my opinion, to go through the File Explorer on my computer to select the image I want to open.<br/>:Adjust:<br />This tab gives you the basics of photo editing so you can quickly adjust and modify an image to your liking. *I would recommend starting with editing mostly from this tab and familiarizing yourself with it before moving on to the Edit tab so that once you are aware of the particular functions each part has in this one you will be able to better understand the next*<br />Pros-<br />1.) This is definitely a very simple interface and really the only basic essentials you would need to get the job done.<br />2.) The Adjust widget has a breakdown of all your tools like cropping, straightening, there is also the &#34;Smart Photo Fix&#34; that has sliders like Brightness, Saturation, etc. It also contains other sections like White Balance, Digital Noise Removal, etc. Easy to navigate and the changes are quickly analyzed and previewed.<br />3.) The center of the screen has the preview of the image you are working on and it modifies the appearance as you are working on it.<br />4.) The tool bars and organizer widget give you a quick rundown of saving, file options, rotation, a preview of other items in the folder and other helpful devices.<br />Cons -<br />1.) Try to keep in mind that this is the simple part of the editing this software provides, it's all the essentials so you'll feel comfortable with this tab but leaving it is very hard. It puts you in a comfort zone and it's very hard to leave, for some people this could be a serious issue.<br />2.) The worst part about this tab is the &#34;Instant Effects&#34; widget. They are all poor options in my opinion, none of them really give any sort of satisfaction that the work you're doing is going to look good if you use them. Just my opinion, so take that as you may. The only plus side to this widget is that there is a preview of how badly you're screwing up your image with using it, but the preview is small so once you double click with confidence, don't be surprised when you Ctrl+Z.<br />:Edit:<br />This is your in depth editing, just about anything and everything you can imagine can be done on this tab once you have it figured out.<br />Pros-<br />1.) The organizer widget at the bottom of the page and the preview in the center have migrated from the Adjust tab into this one, which gives the user a sense of familiarity once you make the transition over to this tab.<br />2.) The tools thrown around on this page are either labeled or have an image that gives a pretty clear assumption as to what they do.<br />3.) &#34;Learning Center&#34; which THE BEST THING EVER for someone just getting used to using this software. It gives you a breakdown of each tool and widget and you name it. You will need this, you will love this, you are welcome.<br />Cons-<br />I don't feel like listing all this out is the most effective way to give you an understanding of the cons of this tab. They can be taken as pros by some people, but for me I find them negative. The tool bar at the top of the page has a drop down menu that gives you different names of what you might be looking for. It's unnecessary, just use the learning center. The materials widget and the layers widget are unclear to me for exactly what they are trying to do. I feel like gimp has a clearer representation of what you can do using these tools and it's free so you should consider getting it if you'll need layering. Overall the interface of this tab is not the most user friendly and it can be a real pain to use. Once you get the hang of it, this can be a photographer's best friend.<br /><br />Overall opinion?<br />For the price, it's a great investment. It will definitely do everything you need as a hobbyist and even if you become a little more professional with your work, you'll find this to be useful and a great tool to have. I like it, it isn't the easiest to use at first, but give it time and try learning something and it will pay off.\n",

      "1\tThis is the worst upgrade version I've ever used.  I've been a quicken user for over 20 years.  I don't mind paying for the forced upgrade if the software hadn't been so buggy, unreliable and unstable.  The automatic upgrade became hellish nightmare because data was not converted correctly.  I had to spend days fixing the screwed up data.  The stocks I no longer owned suddenly needed correction, most of the splits needed corrections due to rounding errors, and worst yet, the spinoff could not be corrected if wrong data was provided, and some transactions could never be updated and got stuck in never land, and the list went on and on.  Even the online help could NOT resolve some of the issues.  I guess Intuit still doesn't know what went wrong because the support is next to none.  Back everything up before updating transactions.  You will never know what is going to go wrong next, and unfortunately, something always goes horribly wrong.  I guess this software would probably work better if you start with no data.\n",

It told me I should download a new driver for my video card, which created havoc and nothing worked properly.  While they couldn't have known this would happen, on the other hand they did not provide a rollback feature. Tech support has been completely useless on dealing with these issues.

      "5\tI'm a YouTube movie reviewer (Drumdums) and have used various video editing programs such as Wondershare and Corel Videostudio X8.  Wondershare was too basic for my needs, and Corel was just too buggy, so I would constantly have output issues.  Adobe Premiere Elements is exactly what I've wanted in a video editing program.  It does take some time to discover all the possibilities, but the patience definitely pays off.  I've been using the program for a few weeks, and it constantly surprises me.  Here are the features I love so far:  - The editing layout.  I love that the main video bar is at the bottom, and all your pictures/effects are added in bars above.  You can add plenty of layers to your video as well. - The &#34;added effects&#34; button.  Any effects you add to your video are placed within this button for quick access.  Need to quickly tweak your color/lighting settings...it's all right here. - Effects!  There are so many options here...and I haven't made my way through all of them.  My favorites are the &#34;Perspective&#34; feature which lets you add depth to pictures, drop shadows, blurring, etc.  Also the &#34;Keying&#34; allows you to use green screen.  And it's pretty easy to use too. - Tools.  This really comes in handy.  I love the &#34;pan and zoom&#34; feature for my photos.  It really gives any presentation a professional look. - Render on the fly!  Click the render button after you've loaded your initial video.  This will make your playback during editing much smoother.  I love this feature! - Final render/publishing options.  This allows you to output your video in so many file formats...and even directly to Facebook, YouTube, and other social sites...all in 1080p too.  I always get really smooth, consistent output too (I didn't get this with Corel).  Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirement (really well above).  This program is a beast and a weak PC won't be able to cut it.  I bought an Asus ROG (i7 processorwith 16 GB RAM) that is specifically for this purpose.\n",

      "1\tThe program under a legitimate license is great, they've come a long way from their bloated antivirus products. This product uses fairly little resources and doesn't slow down the computer at all.<br /><br />HOWEVER, There is a particular practice Symantec has been doing that is questionable at best. When I pay 34 dollars for a product I expect it to work forever, even if I don't renew the license.<br /><br />When my license expires I don't expect to get the latest updates, I don't expect to get the latest security updates. What I find absolutely appalling is when your license expires with NORTON *THE ENTIRE PROGRAM BECOMES DISABLED&#34; that means instead of at least providing outdated protection is provides NO PROTECTION. Clearly Symantec has put profits over security. These guys praise their products as providing the greatest security but yet the minute you aren't paying the renewal fee they disable this program. Further it will constantly prompt you to update your license over and over again. The renewal price is actually more than just paying for another copy off of Amazon.<br /><br />I will NEVER order another NORTON product again as along as they continue this behavior.\n",

Issue? The Manage user part doesn't work. You put in the information, but the user doesn't get created. So you cant use the software, I spend 2 hours reading every forum on autodesk web page, a lot of people with the same issue, one gets thru other never do.

When your money coming in does not match the money going out, well you get the idea. I have bought every version of Lightroom for 2 to 5. Monthly payments even when I do not use it every month.<br /><br />The CC push was the handwriting on the wall, and only new features made it to Lightroom CC, not to the buy the box version. Adobe dropped Photoshop, and soon too Lightroom will be only a CC product. So find something else now. Or once Adobe completely drops boxed editions count that $9.99 a month heads up, maybe $49.99 a month next year ?<br /><br />SURPRISE, not at all, Adobe is only for very large publishing companies, and professional photo studios with 10 or more photographers on staff. Adobe does not want small studios. Adobe has the mindset of Digital Research the owner of the CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers[3]) operating system, they only wanted the high end market. Digital Research turned down IBM when asked to create the new operating system for the upcoming PC. Bill Gates jumped on that deal, so Microsoft is a household name and Digital Research well not so much. The question I have is who will replace Adobe ?\n",

There are, of course, new features that I'm perfectly willing to believe are useful to some people, but not to me. For me, the only effect of the changes is to cause me to come to a halt every fifteen minutes and figure out how to do what I was already doing with the previous version, usually more simply.  For example: the horizontal scroll bar in Excel disappears seemingly by itself. Enter &#34;scroll bar&#34; in the Help window and you get no hits, as though there were no such thing. I never had a problem with this in the previous version.\n",

      "1\tPublished reviews seem to like this product, so I dumped Norton, which was annoying, and switched to Kaspersky AV 2015.  I eventually got it running, perhaps correctly, but what a pain.  I went to the Kaspersky site and downloaded what I thought was the right version of AV.  Turns out to be AV2013.  I fail to understand why you can even find it on their site.  Installed, tried to register, failed.  Blah blah blah.  Went back to Kaspersky site, found something labelled as the &#34;current&#34; Windows version, downloaded 160Megs, started it up and it immediately reported that there was a newer version that needed to be downloaded.  OK, spent some more time.  Installed that, started it up, and all the various modules reported that they failed to load.  Registered and was told that it needed to be updated.  Again?  Clicked on whatever it said and stared at a &#34;connecting&#34; screen forever.  Went out to lunch, returned, still &#34;connecting.&#34;  Closed that, rebooted, various modules again failed to load.  I can no longer remember what steps followed, because I has now wasted something like 3 hours in an already over-scheduled day.  Finally, somehow, got it started on a scan.  The time estimator needs some serious attention, because it kept telling me something like 5 minutes, came down to &#60;1 minute, then was back at 7 minutes, etc.  All the time it was 87% done.  Something over an hour later the scan completed, with no errors, no malware, no nothing.  Meanwhile, the machine was completely unusable.  I seem to now be running in some &#34;normal&#34; mode, but I have no idea how I got here and I'm reluctant to even attempt this on another machine.  I'm sure this is a fabulous product, but the install process is unbelievably bad.  The Kaspersky web site isn't much better.  I have not yet had time to find out what this AV interferes with, but messages here and on the forums warn me that trouble still lies ahead.  I hated Norton for this nonsense; Kaspersky hasjoined the ranks of those who fail to adequately test their install processes.  Good luck  More info: This is terrible software! After one week of use it consumed 250+ GB (!!!) of my C: drive, causing the system to stop and not be rebootable. That's criminal. It turns out that &#34;tracing&#34; is turned on by default, which causes this problem. There are instructions on the web site that show how to turn off tracing. You also need to turn off self-protection in order to delete all the files. (Incidentally, the web site doesn't seem to work in Chrome. I had to open it in IE11, which I generally don't use due to the risks involved.)   I lowered my previous 3-star rating to 1 star because of the disruption this caused to my work (cost me most of a day).  This is the kind of software that gives the entire industry a bad reputation.\n",

After all, I have to have a full time job to even need quicken.  Now, I am just trying to add an account and it keeps locking up.  I have to use task manager to shut down quicken and try again.

      "3\tEvery year I buy a new version of QuickBoooks Pro with Payroll because it's cheaper than renewing. The payroll portion did require that I call Customer Support, but they were actually very helpful and got me going very quickly, and I did not have to enable automatic renewal. I mention this because many people seem to complain about this process, but my experience was fine (as it was last year). BTW, make sure you write down the payroll key because you cannot retrieve it from the software by design.<br /><br />Make sure you save at least one backup before you upgrade - I lost all of my data from QuickBooks 2014 during the upgrade, but thankfully managed to restore it from a backup file. At the time, Intuit were having issues with the Synch server, so it might have been that.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, once you are used to how QuickBooks works, it's fairly easy to use and does the job. I am based in California, which requires you to file some kind of return to 3 different entities (Federal, State and EDD) pretty much every month and QB makes this quite easy once it is setup.<br /><br />The one thing that does annoy me is that QB seems to have trouble using files that are stored on a file server - it really wants them to be on the PC running the software. The reason I have the files on the fileserver is exactly so that they are not on the PC since I've so many problems with disk errors on PCs. I guess I'll just have to move it and make sure I back up every time, but even backups have issues with saving to a networked drive (it keeps complaining that the disk is full, but it's not even close).\n",

      "3\tI've been using Norton Security in various forms since the late 1990s. In recent years, the product has been excellent, but the 2015 edition didn't work on one of my computers, causing serious problems.<br /><br />I believe that the trouble is caused by Norton combining two previously separate products: Norton Internet Security 2014 and another program, Norton 360, that was used by businesses.<br /><br />When I downloaded it to my Windows 7 computer, the installation was bumpy, but the program did eventually get itself installed and working well. I was surprised that the installation seemed to have problems, as I have had no difficulties with Norton products in years.<br /><br />I also needed to install it on my old Windows XP2 computer, that I have been nursing along, until I can replace it. Norton Security has always run fine on it, until this year. Even though the Norton publicity says the program will run on Windows XP systems, I recommend against downloading it into a Windows XP computer.<br /><br />When I tried to download the program onto my Windows XP2 computer, the program first refused to download, demanding that I upgrade to Windows XP3. That requirement wasn't mentioned in the Norton publicity I saw. I do not want to upgrade the old computer to Windows XP3 from XP2, because I did that with another computer years ago, and the upgrade ruined the computer.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support, and a tech altered something in the registry, so that the Norton program would recognize my computer as an XP3, even though it is not. The program then downloaded, but I ran into new problems. The program refused to recognize my code that showed I had legitimately purchased the program. Since I had bought it on Amazon, that was pretty irritating.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support again, and they used their remote entry program to enter my computer and force the program to recognize the code. However, the program kept insisting that I hadn't bought it, and that my &#34;trial subscription&#34; had ended.<br /><br />I again called Norton tech support, and they used a remote entry program to try to fix this. A new problem developed. Their remote entry tech support program didn't like my home computer network, and kept severing the connection between my computer and the Norton tech, leaving the screen showing the conversation between me and the Norton tech on my computer's screen.<br /><br />The entire situation turned into a 12-hour nightmare, in which several different techs could not fix any of the problems, and they then inadvertently created more problems.<br /><br />I finally got a tech who was able to remove the Norton remote connection program from my computer and its screen. (I discovered through a search on my other computer that the program Norton currently uses for remote entry assistance is defective and sometimes operates like malware, leading to situations where it is difficult to remove from a customer's computer.)<br /><br />However, two subsequent Norton techs could not convince my computer that I had paid for the program, and it would not run on my Windows XP2 program.<br /><br />I have to say that Norton tech support tried really hard to resolve the problem, but I gave up after 12 hours. I removed Norton Security from the computer, and installed a free antivirus instead. It doesn't run well, but at least my old Windows XP2 computer is protected, until I can replaced it with a Windows 7 computer.\n",

I find updating about every 3rd year gives me the best new features without having to buy annually.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how cumbersome fairly standard activities are, and how complicated it can be to learn how to do things the Quickbooks way. I have run into major issues (time sucks) with standard things like matching payments to customer invoices. Things like this should be simple, but are usually not intuitive out of the box.<br /><br />My second biggest complaint is how Intuit tries to leverage this program for advertising and sales. I can't get rid of some advertisements on software that I already paid for. I get using advertising on free applications like Mint, but when I already gave you money for this, quit trying to pitch new paid products like credit card processing and payroll.<br /><br />Overall, good and powerful, but not without its annoyances.\n",

The machine is not more than 4 years old, this is just inexcusable.

Quite a difference and no loss of quality with Handbrake.<br /><br />It has a lot of excellent features and is fairly easy to learn, but the crashing and the encoded size of videos makes it a deal breaker to me.

      "1\tI bought this software from their website. I have been using this since June 2012 for my Kindle HD and a couple of Windows 8.1 phones that I've had. I needed something to sync my Contacts and Calendar to both. I tried Microsoft and gave up on them. It's a shame they can't sync their own software's data. Anyway, [[ASIN:B004UJ3AOK DejaOffice]] & CompanionLink offered a very reasonable solution. All I can say about it is,&#34;the software is great WHEN IT WORKS! When it doesn't, WATCH OUT!&#34; And, always keep good copies of your Outlook data that you can reload.<br /><br />Before reading any further, I suggest you go to the Product Description page for [[ASIN:B004UJ3AOK DejaOffice]] and look at the number of fixes on one release!! Does this give you confidence?<br /><br />The first problem I had was with DUPLICATES and TRIPLICATES. It was a mess! They opened a support ticket for me. Part of my complaint to them, explaining the problem, was, &#34;I have spent two days completely uninstalling/re-installing DejaOffice on my phone and Kindle. I have wiped DejaCloud several times, recreating it, as well as wiped the data on my devices, with no success. Although my Outlook on my desktop has remained constant, having no problems, DejaOffice on my Windows Phone and my Kindle keep producing duplicates [and triplicates] and it is impossible to deal with and our hands are tied because we can do nothing to correct the problems. It just messes up our entire work environment!&#34; They eventually provided a fix, but I wasted a tremendous amount of time!<br /><br />I am currently dealing with another problem. It is truncating FIRST NAMES that have more than one name, like: Mary Elizabeth, Ann Marie, Terri Ann, John Paul, Billy Jo, Pastor Bob, Cheap Frank, etc. I enter data this way because this is how they are called. I can begin with a new Outlook file (from a good backup), sync (one-way) Outlook to DejaCloud, wiping it first; then uninstall and reinstall DejaOffice on my phone, choosing to read (one-way) from DejaCloud and the data appears exactly as it should. If then I change the settings for both CompanionLink on my PC and DejaOffice on my phone to sync (push) both ways and automatically, and do something like add two new contacts to my phone and one appointment, I run into trouble! If the changes don't appear right away in Outlook, then I initiate the sync manually from CompanionLink. When the sync is completed (this was the first two-way sync on a new Outlook file) whatever followed the first name/word in the First Name field was truncated! This is a new problem! It has worked with my Outlook data for the past three years. It worked for 12 years using Nokia's PC Suite and then their Nokia Suite on my Nokia phones. They say they cannot recreate or duplicate the problem. It's like saying &#34;the problem is not ours, it's yours!&#34; They want me to duplicate the problem for them! Isn't that unbelievable! I'm just a user. I supply them with Outlook data. Once their software processes it, I actually loose some of it. Their software is ripping it away.<br /><br />I have literally spent days upon days restoring my data and trying to find work-arounds. I have over 1,200 contacts and thousands of calendar entries; but I always had these numbers. It's a big job! Things always worked. I also expect them to work if I am paying for the software.<br /><br />Like I said, the software is great WHEN IT WORKS! When it doesn't, WATCH OUT!<br /><br />UPDATE 09/29/2015: Eventually I personally concluded that this software was simply troubled and gave up. It wasn't a simply a guess. I was a Software Engineer mostly in OS R&D for 16 years. You can't always blame bad behaving software on your users, especially when you’re dealing with stuff like an Outlook database. So, I signed up for a trial period with AkrutoSync. Their website seemed to promise a lot. However, I did not like the setup process (a bit crude!) or how it worked (with IP addresses: 192.168.x.x assigned by the router) and its User Interface, but eventually got used to it and bought it. I have not had a problem syncing contacts, calendar, etc. in over 4 months now WITH THE SAME DATA DEJAOFFICE CANNOT! And that’s the same data that worked with the old Nokia PC Suite when I was using it. It is worth looking into. It's virtually trouble free, except when the IP Address changes (rarely with Netgear). It's not worth fighting with DejaOffice/CompanionLink Software or their staff. When their business collapses, maybe they'll get the message!.x assigned by the router) and its User Interface, but eventually got used to it and bought it.

I'm happy because i'm legally using it, they're happy because i'm not trying to download a cracked version.  Win-Win if you ask me.  I think there's a free trial involved, so if you don't want the best pricing with the 12-month commitment, but don't know if you'll like it, just try it.  if you don't like it, go spend full price on a legacy version, install it from the cd rom, use your dial up connection to activate it, and be happy!\n",

      "1\tI have used Turbotax Corporations and Partnerships software to handle partnership (Form 1065) returns for at least the past decade. However, for tax year 2014, given the huge difference in price between that Turbotax product and H&R Block's Premium and Business software (over $100 at the time of my purchase decision), I decided to give Amazon's PC-downloadable version of H&R Block's product a try. I expected to incur some &#34;learning curve&#34; time the first time using H&R Block’s product. However, I grossly underestimated the amount of time I would ultimately end up wasting and did not expect the H&R Block Business software to be as kludgy as it is. A few examples of the difficulties: (a) I figured out through some significant trial and error that the initial installation requires shutting down your anti-virus software firewall (the HR Block software froze several times until I figured this out, and I had to restart my computer each time to unfreeze the software), (b) processing of entries is much slower than in Turbotax, (c) the interview process is not nearly as seamless or as intuitive or as complete as the Turbotax interview process, nor is it is as visually attractive, and H&R Block's interview does not cause you to fill in every relevant blank in the 1065 (for example, the TMP's phone number); (c) the method of identifying and correcting errors in the H&R Block product is cumbersome; (d) the error review doesn't seem to pick everything up (for example, if you follow the interview process, which seems to force you to identify partner or partners having 50% or more interests before completing K-1s, you will end up reporting each of those partners twice in Schedule B-1, Part II with the result, if you have two partners at 50% interests each that you can end with a total of 200%-and the review process does not pick this up as an error); (e) you do not receive emails about efiling status and must go into the software to find out about it instead; (f) at leastas to MN, the state form (in MN, Form M3 and related forms) seems to be something of an afterthought-there is no interview and you cannot rely on the software to complete all the blanks and calculations and review the entries for errors (it seems that you essentially have to use the software for MN like you would a fill-in-the blank pdf form); and (g) you cannot efile with H&R Block's software in a significant number of states, including MN (in fairness, though, I have not compared H&R Block's list with the list of states Turbotax can be used to file partnership returns in this year). Even having now moved up the learning curve as to H&R Block’s Business tax software, I'll probably return to using Turbotax for Form 1065 use next year, particularly if Turbotax gets to be a little more competitive on price.\n",

Not to mention that I spent more time following them than I would have by just deleting the phantoms.  At the end, my computer ground to a halt and refused to load any of my programs.  When attempting to scan with Kaspersky, I was prompted that my &#34;license&#34; was illegal.  That's when I uninstalled the program.  Things are humming along just fine now.  Fast boot.  Fast loading.  NO phantoms.  I would love to get my money back but that doesn't seem to be an option.

I find it a little confusing to set up recurring scans and to stop scans in progress if I need to. Information for each function seems to be scattered in different places and I have to click several links to find what I'm looking for instead of having it all in one place. There is an Autopilot mode for when you're gaming or working on a project that is supposed to stop unwanted interruptions but the only thing that kept interrupting me was Bitdefender itself. You can switch it off, but then what is the purpose of it? I tried using Safepay for banking and online purchases, but it was very confusing and annoying to use.

This is his review:<br />Prior to Dragon Premium 13.0 I have been using Dragon Home 12.5. Currently I am writing this review using Home 12.5. Earlier today I uninstalled Premium 13.0 and reinstalled Home 12.5. The reason?<br />My major use for the computer is genealogy work and historical document indexing. The indexing work involves the use of a third-party database program. Using voice recognition software or else the on-screen keyboard that I can click using the mouse, I enter names of people, places and dates into fields in the database. This data is uploaded and made available throughout the world as searchable information on people's family history.<br />Home 12.5 allowed me to use correction and other commands that are part of Dragon within this database software. Since the Premium 13.0 was on sale, I thought that it would provide greater functionality. I was surprised to find that Premium 13.0 had less functionality. When I dictated a name of a place or person, 13.0 would not recognize the word that had just been placed into that field. As a result, I could not ask 13.0 for word correction nor could I teach within that software the correct spelling. The only way within Premium 13.0 to make a correction for a name, would be the use of the backspace command.<br />As far as using Dragon for email or Microsoft Office products, it did not make a noticeable difference whether I was using Home 12.5 or Premium 13.0.<br />System Resources<br />My System: Windows 8.1, 4 GB RAM, Core I 3 processor, 15 inch Asus Notebook<br />Uninstalling Premium 13.0, I learned that even when the software is exited, it remains resident in the operating memory of the computer. Windows was unable to uninstall Premium 13.0 until I used Task Manager to force-stop Premium 13.0. As soon as Premium 13.0 had been fully shut down, there was a reduction in system memory usage from 42% to 30%. When Home 12.0 has been normally exited there is not any significant overhead on the memory demonstrated.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />Dragon Naturally Speaking software has been a useful tool for me. However the most recent version (13 .0), provides a fresh user interface, possible improvements in accuracy, but no improvement with actually a downgrade in utility with any applications outside of mainstream browsers and Microsoft Office. I am also concerned about the memory overhead demanded by version 13.0, even when the program is exited and not in use.13.0 had been fully shut down, there was a reduction in system memory usage from 42% to 30%.

      "4\tAn inexpensive alternative to photoshop,.and it works just as well. It accepts any plug-ins that photoshop does. It can perform layers and masks. It does a good job importing raw files, but there is separate software available that does it better, depending on your camera. And for the beginner, it's easy to lean. My only gripe is that it loads slowly, even on Windows 7. Otherwise, it's a pretty good photo editing alternative to photoshop.<br />Note - I recently upgraded to a new PC and couldn't find the download for Paint Shop Pro. But because I had purchased it from Amazon as a download, I was able to download it again from them. I'm really please I could do that.\n",

Nothing gets fixed and the site now conveniently does not allow for you to call them to tell them the issues.  Obviously because they do not care.  Pathetic.  This is a no buy.

Things worked better there, and my girlfriend seems to be enjoying the software. To me, though, it seems extremely slow and ugly, and appears to be built entirely in ancient Adobe Flash.

      "5\tI've searched for hours and found only the most trustworthy and best software to be Connectify! Connectify PRO is personally my favorite router software ever! You don't need to buy a 200 dollar router which you then have to go through an abundance of confusion to set up or to extend the wifi range. Connectify lets you do all that with just a computer with a wireless card! Why spend 200 on a router when you can spend 200 on a cheap computer and extend your wireless range to the max!? Connectify also is a 2 in 1 router. It can go with you wherever you go! Once installed on your computer, wherever you bring your computer, Connectify comes along!! I would definitely recommend Connectify.\n",

      "1\tI switched to Quicken when Microsoft Money came to an end.  Each year I am shocked at how additional errors come up -- meaning that more and more things *BREAK*.  (In software development, this is called 'regression.'  It is standard practice to test to make sure that new versions don't break already-working-things before you release it. It is abundantly clear that Intuit does *not* follow basic software engineering practices.)  Quicken 2015 has added features that add questionable value (&#34;Portfolio X-Ray&#34; &#34;Credit Report&#34;), introduced additional bugs, and not fixed errors from previous versions.  Here are some specifics:<br /> - Budgeting has been a fiasco. I fully expect that a financial product that has been around for this many years would have budgeting working flawlessly by now.  They had to do a major revision for this version to fix the horrible &#34;budgeting&#34; from the previous versions and it's still clunky.  This is inexcusable for a product this mature. Budgeting is *not* rocket science.  Or some new mysterious idea.<br /> - Intuit hasn't done simple things to improve usability that users have been asking about for years. For example:  why can't they show the computed difference between the financial institution (bank) balance and the quicken balance?  That computed difference is what is valuable information -- why make your users bring up a calculator and calculate it themselves each time?<br /> - The user interface does not make use of features and abilities that could make it so much easier to use for so many users.  They keep adding things to the user interface, but they haven't modernized it in many many years.  It's old and clunky and it shows. Compare it to something like Mint (which Intuit bought not too long ago).  It could be so much better, but instead is stuck in the past.<br /> - There have been bugs fixes for simple account balance errors!!  This would barely be excusable for version 1.0 of any financial software.  It's *definitely* not OK for financial software that has been around for so long!<br />- There are known bugs with downloading transactions (since at least Quicken 2012).<br />- &#34;Customer support&#34; is an oxymoron at best.  They simply go through basic help scripts and if they can't solve your problem with that, then you're SOL.  I have never had customer support successfully help with any issue or error.  The &#34;Quicken Support Community&#34; is where Inuit apparently expects users to solve their own problems.  A little time spent there will quickly show you the many on-going issues that users have and that Intuit has not addressed.<br />- Some updates to the product have been *automatically* applied -- you don't get a choice about whether you want to apply the update or not.<br />- As others have noted, Intuit does not fully disclose why you must create an online account -- they do not give you the option.  I do not user their online services or mobile syncing.  But the real issue is that Intuit does not explain what they do with the info *or* give you the ability to opt out.<br />- You cannot really stay with an older (more stable, more reliable) version because Quicken cuts off the ability to download transactions -- which is a huge part of the value of the product.  (This would be a totally acceptable practice if later versions didn't become even more buggy.)<br /><br />Instead of fixing known problems and being a mature, rock-solid, reliable product after all of this time, they continue to add &#34;features&#34; like the &#34;free credit report&#34; (which, BTW, has not worked for me or many others) or &#34;portfolio x-ray&#34; -- which is unusable to me because quicken cannot successfully add downloaded transactions to keep my investment accounts up-to-date.  They're the only game in town that allows you to connect to so many financial institutions and they know it.  They haven't put any real focus on making the product reliable, correct, and easy to use because they haven't had to.<br /><br />Beware of the overly-glowing 5-star reviews of this product that were posted before the product was even released or that only talk about how the installation goes.  (If they were beta-testers, why didn't they disclose it?)  Beware of the reviews that only talk about features and don't tell you about an actual user experience with the product.<br /><br />Most of all, beware buying Quicken 2015.  If you must buy it, keep your expectations low, expect errors when you do anything more than the most simple financial tracking, and -- like many of us -- keep your fingers crossed that a competitor will soon be viable enough that we can switch to a better, more reliable product.\n",
      "1\tIn one word: USELESS.  I loaded Quicken for Mac 2015 onto my Mac Book Pro (using Maverick 10.9.5) and did not get any farther than the login screen (&#34;Please enter your Intuit user ID&#34;). 5 minutes earlier I set up an Intuit ID & password. It WOULD NOT accept my user ID & password. An hour long chat session at Intuit with (judging by sentence structure and grammar) someone who is barely fluent in English was unproductive.  I wish I could give it 0 stars.\n",

Limited support for my accounts, and missing major brokerages and banks.  Additionally, random error and force closes.  Just a broken, half baked product.  Intuit has a great 60 return policy.  All I had to do was call amazon, they sent me an email with instructions on how to get my money back.  3 weeks later I got a refund check from intuit.  So good on them for having a &#34;love it or return it policy&#34;... bad on them for having a product that is unlovable.\n",

Intuit has a &#34;password removal tool&#34; to address this problem, but that didn't do shh... um.. anything. Tech support had me upload my file to them (scary as h... um... heck to send my data file which has all my passwords across the internet). Then I just got an email back saying my file was f... um... unrecoverable. So basically, Quicken locked me out of my own data, and has no solutions.  The worst part is, Intuit doesn't seem to give a f... um... hoot.  Please, someone, Warren, Elon, Mark, Larry, Tim, ANYONE, please, buy the Quicken product line from Intuit and fix it.\n",

They cannot make either work for me. Ultimately, they end up saying: Give me access to your computer, so I can see what's going on. Right. You've worked an hour, unable to solve what should be a routine issue, but I should give you, God knows who in God knows where, full access to my computer.

      "1\thave been using TurboTax Premier since 1998. My experience last year: The company is dishonest and they do NOT stand behind their product.<br />When a company recognize there is a big error in their SW and send you an apology letter and ask you to send their SW product<br />back to them for a refund and the customer does ship the product with her/his own cost and then the customer get a letter from the company - oh! we are very sorry, we can't refund you the money because you didn't buy it directly from us...they were told I bought it from a third party not directly from the company website...and they keep the SW - should go out of business. I called them 3 times after a long hold ...asked to talk to a supervisor, they said supervisor will call me back..never got a call back. The whole dealing with this company take you to the black hole.<br />I never said this about any company - but I can say this with certainly! Don't buy Turbuo Tax.<br />Reasons/ my experience with Turbu Tax and Intuit:<br /><br />1). they cheated me. 2). they wasted many hours of my time 3). they still sale their product with the same error.<br /><br />TurboTax Premier flaw:<br />Income property sold and later within 6 months did an exchange (1031exch). With the SW it goes to calculate the capital gain from the sale - but does not take you to purchase of new property for 1031 exchange. So, the gain fro sold property does not get carry over.<br />The SW reflects a gain and show to pay tax on the gain. The forms and steps to tell it I bought an exchange property is lacking big time.<br />I ended up hiring a CPA and pay $900 for my tax return and never got my money back from Intuit.<br /><br />DON'T BUY INTUIT PRODUCTS - THEY ARE NOT HONEST - THEY WILL CHEAT YOU, when you need them! They don't stand by their product.<br />INTUIT should go out of business. There are other tax products out there to use/buy.\n",

For example it requires registration of the product - and there is no link to registration in the installed software. How about making it easier to collect on that bragged-about &#34;guarantee&#34; if you're so sure about your product?  Definitely not happy with Turbo Tax.\n",
      "5\tI have wanted a MAC for a long time but always found myself buy or fixing a PC because it seemed less expensive.  I convinced myself I was &#34;saving $$&#34; but frankly... over the years... I have spent a lot of cash on hardware, software, updates and the constant need to buy new.  Finally I took the leap of faith and put a Mac on a store Credit Card and I am a BELIEVER!!  Mac is the only way for me!!!<br /><br />So, soon after getting my feet in the MacVerse I learned I wanted and needed to edit images and photos.  So, okay what do I do?  I did not know what software to buy or get free and so I read about this Fotor and looked at Reviews and thought ... heck let's give it a go!  And WOW  am I glad I did.  It is different than software I was used to.  I was using an old version of Dreamweaver Fireworks.  Now I thought that was the bomb and still love it.  But I have to say, this FREE software is awesome.  It takes a little getting used to and is not as fully editing as say Fireworks but look, it is Free so there are going to be limits as they do have a Paid FotorPRO version. It lets me do quite a lot of things that for the most part are all i need to quickly shift colors, crop, frame or add some effects to.<br /><br />To use it simply open it up and chose from one of the three options : Edit, collage, or Batch.  Then you have to select a per-existing image to use the Fotor. The Edit works on one image then you EXPORT it to save or send.  The Collage gives several options to place several images into one, and the Batch allows you to select a Folder to apply the same effects to all at once.<br /><br />I wish I could select colors or shapes to delete or change but again...I expect that with a fully paid software not a quick edit program such as this.  There are many options to stylize your pics and add text and make really quick automatic changes.  Just download it and take a look.  You can always throw it in the Trash can if you don't like.\n",

Recently I had the organizer lock up when I was trying to bring in a group off photos off my memory card.  I had to uninstall and reinstall the program to get it to work.  I think the programs in Photoshop are getting too big and complicated so there are always problems with installations, lock-ups, and error messages. Maybe Adobe should produce a smaller and more simple version that does all the basics but doesn't have all the problems!  I have been a loyal user of PSE.  I've had versions 3,4,6,10 and 13.

If I had followed their advice, that could have hurt me financially for many years as I would have thought that was correct and would not have contributed more money to these two programs.\n",

      "5\tI used the free version for several years through several &#34;Operating Systems Du Jour&#34; and it worked great, cleaning up general crap that collects every time you use your computer. I finally, after using the company for free for so many years purchased the Pro version that works in the background quietly but only partially cleaning your computer. I use this program every time I begin to log off. First I will use a PC Tune Up tool that comes with an online tech service I purchased (much like one available through Geek Squad but mine is from IYOGI). I then clean all the cookies from my session using the tools portion of Chrome and lastly run a full scan using CCleaner. This sounds like it would take a while but it only takes about 3 minutes or so and it keeps my computer as fast as the day I bought it (and no one is tracking my computer usage!). I NEVER get a pop up, seldom get any spam and what spam I do get is from Vendors selling my email address after I make a purchase. This is a terrific program that really does help keep your computer clutter free no matter how much &#34;surfing&#34; you do. I HIGHLY recommend at least the free version and the cost of the Pro version is so small that it is very much worth it and allows you the use of the softwares updates which occur about every 2 weeks or so. Superb program even in its free form, the Pro version is MUCH better and is inexpensive!!\n",

I'm sure there is someone out there that actual notices and appreciates the changes that have been made since Office 2010 but for most people this is just a rip off plain and simple.<br /><br />  Microsoft realized that Office, in the way that most of us use it, is a very simple product.  By going with a $100 a year model they can leech a lot of cash off people too rich to care about that sum of money or too technologically unsavy to realize that there are free options out there.<br /><br />  If you aren't incredibly rich, you already own some (ANY) previous version of office made in the last decade, or you are open to going for one of the many free alternatives to office (Libre Office, google docs/slide/etc.) then you should not in a million years pay for a subscription to this product.

I've been using quicken for 15 years and this iteration is particularly maddening.  while there's a lot quicken 2015 can do, the program is clunky and unresponsive.  first, when upgrading from a previous generation (in my case quicken 2012 because the nice people at intuit won't support their programs after three years - buyer beware), the existing data in quicken home inventory could not be imported to quicken 2015.  i have done extensive research online and from what i can gather intuit changed the file format for home inventory data and there doesn't seem to be a way to convert it to the new format, one has to re-enter all the data from scratch.  the program for no apparent reason will seemingly randomly change your program to particular formats and default options which are different than what you have set as the default options in quicken &#34;preferences&#34; or to previous default options of the program itself.  intuit has a virtual lock on the personal finance software market with no serious competitors, and it shows.

You are better off tracking expenses in Excel. Worst of all, my data file with over 10 years of transactions crashed.  I back it up every two months, so now I have pretty much lost every transaction in the last 2-3 months as I am not going to recreate manually. TRULY HORRIFIC!!!\n",

Now having said that, I have been using Quicken for about 12 to 15 years so I obviously like the software. I think it works good its reliable and relatively easy to set up and use.

      "4\t\"Overall this is a good product, and one that I'd recommend, but there are some features that I really don't like much.<br /><br />In my original Quicken application, I could customize reports. I don't seem to be able to do that here -- there are 3 different types, and what you get is what you get. Not only that, but there's no way to format the report for printing in a format that works best for you.<br /><br />I've also found that the Help menu is not at all helpful. I wanted to set up a new car loan, and typed in Auto Loan, and got nothing. Had to open each available help topic to find the one that referred to -- you guessed it -- Auto Loans!<br /><br />And, much to my dismay, they have done away with \\\\\"\"smart\\\\\"\" categories (I think that's what they were called) which meant that you could assign specific categories to specific items and they'd always populate that way. For instance, I'm a gamer, and buy a lot of games from an online provider, paying for them with one of my credit cards. When the transactions download, I have to edit the category on each one because they come in as \\\\\"\"uncategorized.\\\\\"\" Not horrible, just a nuisance.<br /><br />And this isn't a specific complaint about the product, but I find it remarkable that I cannot download a QIF file for my mortgage payments from Quicken Loan. Strikes me as odd.<br /><br />But, as I said at the beginning, its a good product. I will continue to use it, and have recommended it in the past to others. And am likely to continue to do so.\"\n",

When I go into my Category list I'd find gibberish categories full of symbols I can't even create with my keyboard! Categories like &#34;[] [] 89.&#34; I was concerned it was a virus, but a thorough virus scan showed no viruses. Then a few days later the categories would be OK. I got so frustrated I deleted the entire program and reinstalled without any updated to R7 or whatever it was. Then I noticed there was a brand new update version, so I downloaded that a few weeks ago. Now today, randomly, my categories are again missing!

When she returned, I heard her say &#34;I can't deal with this&#34; and I was disconnected.  Being April 15th, I was forced to file for an extension and then manually submitted my Federal and State Forms<br />  I am totally dissatisfied with Turbo Tax and especially with their no-help line which is an absolute joke.

      "5\tI believe (and the majority of research suggests) that flashcards and spaced repetition are by far the best ways to memorize and retain details. For step 1 I used some rudimentary digital flashcards made from First Aid, along with Pathoma videos, DIT videos and UWorld questions. I did not get through all the flashcards, but for the sections that I did, I scored very highly.<br />Overall, I got a 255. I have no doubt that if I had this program available I would have done much better. I wouldn't have had to stumble through cram, quizlet, and Anki (great programs in their own right) trying to compile decent board sources while using my homemade spaced repetition algorithm. I don't have the attention span to read a book, so after I get concepts from sites like onlinemeded, I like to beat them into my brain using these flashcards. The spaced repetition algorithm was good about 5-6 months ago when I first got these cards. Now it is amazing. The memorang team seems ridiculously dedicated to actually improving the program, revising the material, and listening to feedback from customers.<br />On top of that, the premade flashcards, such as this Step 2 CK deck, are ridiculously cheap. I was lucky to stumble upon them from google during my IM rotation. I couldn't believe how cheap they were, so I immediately bought the Step 1 and Step 2 flashcards. I think the real value of these cards is at least a few hundred, and I think I got in on the ground floor here.<br />Speaking of my IM rotation, I slackingly combined these with viewings of the onlinemeded videos, no UWorld questions or questions of any kind, and no other resources at all, and managed to hit an 86(mean 78, SD 8) on the shelf. I did best on those sections for which I had used sets of these flashcards. I know it's not a great score, but it makes you curious that if a slacker like me can perform a standard deviation above the mean, then imagine what a dedicated student can do.<br />On a final note to this rambling review, I think that these cards are gonna spread like wildfire among med students, just as onlinemeded currently is. So it would be smart to invest in them ASAP. I plan to return to both the step 1 and step 2 CK cards, and possibly even the individual shelf cards during residency to review the basics and the pathophys. Get em while they're cheap (and even after their monetary value reaches their real value).\n",

      "2\tThis software is a huge step backwards.  I started with Quicken in 1992 - 23 years ago!  I use it predominantly to write and print checks for my employer's five accounts.  I managed to hold off ditching Quicken 2006 for years, but when I replaced my computer I had no choice but to upgrade to Quicken 2014.  I used to actually enjoy &#34;accounts payable batch&#34; days.  It was a vicarious thrill to spend gobs of money and whip out 150 checks in short order.  Now I dread it.  Earlier versions remembered the most recent check written to a payee.  I could immediately tell if I was entering a check already paid (sometimes checks and invoices cross in the mail).  This version only remembers the last time I &#34;memorized&#34; a payee.  So, let's say I memorize a check to ABC in January.  I write a check to ABC every month thereafter.  In every subsequent month,  Quicken will still be autofilling the January information (rather than the previous month's information like earlier versions of Quicken did).  Quicken 2014 is riddled with these little annoyances.  In the check writing pane, when I move from one account to another, it invariably stops me with the query &#34;Save last transaction?&#34;  If I press &#34;Yes,&#34; it saves a blank check.  If I press &#34;No,&#34; it allows me to continue.  Since I am jamming through a blizzard of bills, this distraction ticks me off.  The interface with my printer leaves a lot to be desired, and the ability to customize reports is weaker than any version of Quicken I have ever used.  I'm using a Mac and running Parallels with Windows 7 so that I can have my Quicken (the Quicken for Mac was such a holy-hell mess that I gave up on it after a mere two frustrating weeks).  I give it two stars because, at the end of the day, it does function.  However, I now spend a lot of time researching other check writing software, hoping to find something better.  With Quicken's descent into terrible mediocrity, I expect that something better willbe along soon.  I'm so disappointed that a once spectacular software has degenerated into this clunky, user-hostile piece of junk.\n",

      "4\tRPG Maker 2003 is a much older version of the software that has only just recently been translated and localized. In the years since many have seen and used the later versions of XP, VX, and VX Ace. I have personally spent hours upon hours trying to make even the tiniest of games and there is always this wall that comes up blocking further progress. This was generally due to either a lack of more ideas or complete hard drive crashes and the loss of data.<br /><br />Though with the availability of massive, cost-effective hard drives, the latter has not been much of a problem these last few years. So when someone honestly says “oh you just made that using RPG Maker” they generally have no real idea of how much time and effort still needs to go into making such a project. The time building the environments, the time scripting events and cutscenes, and the time getting combat “just right” to not have it too easy, too hard, or just plain boring. All of this is even before getting into the more custom sprite making, music and battle systems.<br /><br />Before getting into details, the most important factor is to understand the manner in which RPG Maker 2003 is designed. Any game, RPG, Action RPG, Action, Platformer, you name it, has three distinct layers. Each of these layers have their own specific use and must be designed accordingly if the final project is to succeed.<br /><br />The first layer works like the ground as it defines where the eventual player can or cannot move. Straight paths, winding corridors, walls or no walls to define these paths that is your choice to make. The layer above this one is where a user can throw in obstacles and decorations such as beds, chairs, barrels, statues and other fun stuff to make players move around. The final layer is perhaps the most or least important depending upon how you see it. This is where users can enter script for events, cutscenes, transitions, change random battles for on screen enemy battles that you run into and so on.<br /><br />The interface in RPG Maker 2003 is simple and clean which is a staple of the RPG Maker series. Just about any required tool or option can be found either on the left side of the window with the available tileset or all along the upper taskbar leaving the majority of the window for the user to design their adventure. The tilesets take up about a quarter of the left side of the screen along with the project’s name and area maps which are all easily accessible with a simple click of the mouse. The maps can be easily dragged-and-dropped as needed or even put under another one which indents it in the list to show the user, or another collaborator, that those maps are part of the one above it.<br /><br />Moving on to much more fun things than the interface, comes the actual construction of the game. I will be honest and say that anyone that has ever used MS Paint or Adobe’s Photoshop will find themselves right at home with the following options.<br />-  The Pen tool to draw tiles one click at a time;<br />-  The Rectangle tool form a rectangle of the selected choices;<br />-  The Oval tool which is like the rectangle but more circular; and finally<br />-  The Fill tool that will fill up any space that is attached to it.<br /><br />While the above might not sound like a lot of available options, they get the job done rather quickly and efficiently. Some of you, by this point may have realized that I never said that there was an eraser to remove anything that was unwanted and this because instead of being part of the selection tools is instead part of the tilesets. Unfortunately this means that the Eraser can change places depending upon which level of the tilesets you are looking at. It would have been nice to have a dedicated Eraser tool, but at the very least there still is an option for it.<br /><br />After you initially build your first environment(s), which will be an ongoing process because it is never really finished as there is alwaysgoing to be that “one last thing” that you will want to add or modify, comes the placing of events. Because I could literally be here until next week writing about what events can do, I will try to keep it brief (but feel free to comment below for more information!).<br /><br />Events are multifaceted and exist to make everything work from more than just moving around the map. These control possibilities and absolutes, from allowing a player to move into a house, from the village into a field or a cave, fight an encounter as long as they have talked to Town Persons A-B-C and walked around the well three times counter-clockwise, to no longer being able to enter a shop because you irritated the owner. All of these options, and more, can be set within one event square with commands that can be input into a window from a series of available choices.<br /><br />To say that there are a lot of options would be an understatement; unlike the VX Ace version that I recently used, the RPG Maker 2003 does not have sections that break up the options under headers to make them easy to find. This could create a bit of a challenge when trying to remember which option was on which tab and how far down the page it was. While this is not the end of the world, it could certainly make the things much more time-consuming. There are a few items that could have been updated for the re-release such as the ability to set the Face Graphic while inputting the text instead of having them both as separate actions which can really fill out the Contents window very fast.<br /><br />(RPG Maker 2003 Event Windows compared to RPG Maker VX Ace)<br /><br />These really are only minor details, but they are minor details that do add up over time but in regards to how much time has been spent and sometimes into how frustrated you can become before really needing to take a break from the project.<br /><br />The final gear that makes everything work is the database. This acts as the central storage unit for every ounce of data from your characters and enemies to animations and tilesets. In here just about any modification can be done. A perfect example would be for anyone who’s playing Final Fantasy IV when Cecil goes from being a Dark Knight to a Paladin. This would have been two separate entries in the database with an event handler that would switch over his sprite, his experience and level, his base stats, and his equipment the moment he defeats his darker self.<br /><br />RPG Maker 2003 is a great software that is rather easy to use but has a learning curve to figure out exactly what everything does.

I've been on the help line with several different people and none have helped one bit, have spent hours trying to clear this problem. I see others have this same problem and to create a &#34;Remember Password&#34; is basic programing and yet Quicken can't get it. One person brought up &#34;why is password needed as bank/brokerage requires it&#34;, i.e. why is a password needed to get online?\n",
      "1\tI'm a small business owner, with a need to simply track several accounts in one bank - no interest is sophisticated tracking of investments, net worth etc. I used to use Microsoft Money in Parallels on my Macbook Pro, and as this was the only app I used in Parallels (which I hated) I decided to give it up and try a Mac- only financial software app. I researched the possibilities, and decided on Ibank 5 (I use OSX Mountain Lion). Big mistake! I was able to set it up as new, but in contradiction to the blurb, couldn't import the data from MS Money. Anyway, I eventually set up the various accounts and the banking data manually, and now after a year of use -  1). It crashes so often that I have learned to save the file after every single reconciliation. I contacted the help desk chat line, who had no explanation, but said I should force quit it every time it crashes and then re-start it. Takes ages. MS Money used to &#34;guess&#34; the details of repeated transactions pretty well, and fill in the details after typing the first word or so. This app frequently gets it wrong, and inserts the wrong information, so I have to carefully go through every individual transaction and change the details in every 2 or 3 (which I have to repeat if/ when it crashes before saving). Every month it takes as least twice as long to check my monthly accounts as MS Money used to. I tried to upgrade , but got a message that the upgrade couldn't work in Mountain Lion - only Yosemite. I thought Apple products were supposed to be backwards compatible, for at least a year or 2! In short, this app is the my only regret that I am no longer using a Windows system.\n",

      "1\tI have been using Quickbooks for many years. Over the years, my opinion of Intuit has gone steadily downhill. I am quite certain that Quickbooks management does nothing but sit around and dream up new ways to screw their customers. Due to the high cost of switching, they know they have current users by the gonads. So they keep looking for new ways to get more money out of customers. Of course every business does that. But Intuit manages to do it in the most heavy-handed and annoying ways possible.<br /><br />I used to upgrade Quickbooks every year. (Of course Quickbooks comes out with a new version every year, whether they have any real improvements or not.) My accountant recommended it because the first year used to include free payroll updates. Quickbooks put a stop to that. No big announcement. First, they just made it nearly impossible to get it to work. Calling their tech support, I was forced to talk to 5 different people who all told me that I had to pay for payroll and they'd be happy to sign me up. Only after explaining for the umpteenth time that the box still said it was included free for a year did someone finally tell me how to get it to work.<br /><br />Then the next year there was no free payroll even with a new version. Then they limited payroll to only 3 users unless you paid a large premium to increase the number. So I stopped using their payroll calculators. I found that I could quickly calculate payroll myself using paycheckcity.com and put the numbers into Quickbooks.<br /><br />The ability to import banking data saves a lot of time. Now in June 2015, I find that my 2012 version of Quickbooks no longer allows me to import the file I've downloaded from my bank. Supposedly this is because Intuit no longer &#34;supports&#34; my 2012 version. How is the active disabling of functionality equivalent to no longer supporting an older version? This is just evil. It is bad enough that support ends after only 3 years, but to disable functions that requireno &#34;support&#34; on their end is totally uncalled for.\n",

After that, the software crashed, was not stable, could not run my blu-ray.  Every time I now  open the software, it kept asking for the registration (which failed now even though it had worked before).  I went to un-install/reinstall the software, but there is no uninstall in the windows programs applet (what software manufacturer does not put an un-install in there now days?!?!?)  I have opened a support case with the Manufacturer, but there is no support number, only email support so I am not thinking they are going to be able to help much.  I think this is lousy software.

      "1\tI have used Quicken for 15 years. Quicken has always been the only physical record of my financial activity. I was forced to update my 2012 version because it would no longer support the import of my transactions. 2015 is 100X worse. Importing transactions- either by downloading direct from web and doing an import, double clicking on the download file or using the one step update feature, rendors Quicken 2015 frozen. You will find yourself using task manager to kill Quicken every time. You will see the &#34;processing response&#34; for hours. What should, and has always been a very simple task has become next to impossible. According to google, I am not alone with this issue. For the life of me, I can not understand why the product can no longer do such basic function of the software.\n",
      "1\tIt won't install  I just wasted my money!\n",
      "1\tFails at the most basic tasks. Inexplicably, they've removed the ability to edit memorized payees. So, import your bank statement. Quicken categorizes, say, your paycheck with a single category. But you need to add categories for all the deductions (Fed tax, state tax, SS, etc.). One by one you type them in. Guess what? Next time you import a statement, for that exact same payee, you'll have to re-type all of the categories in the split. Same is true for non-split transactions. For a memorized payee, there's simply no way to permanently change the category applied.<br /><br />You could do this in 2007 and previous versions by editng the &#34;Memorized Transactions&#34; list. In their wisdom, Intuit has done away with this. Quicken support claims that it will apply the last used categories, but that does not happen.\n",

      "1\tI purchased Bitdefender directly from the Bitdefender website last year.  For a number of months, the product seemed to run decently effectively. Then all of a sudden I start having weird issues where I can't access any HTTPS: websites because of a certificate error. I'm a pretty tech savy guy and this one had me absolutely stumped. After spending hours and hours (and I mean HOURS) searching the internet, reading tech support chat logs, etc. I finally came across a random reference to a person with the same problem who thought he had connected the dots because his Bitdefender license expired and he switched to a new antivirus. It turns out their SSL scanning tool works by spoofing valid certificates - brilliant - and that means you can't access any HTTPS websites - even more brilliant. OK, no big deal just turn off the SSL scanning feature - no problem. EXCEPT IT IS LIKE A FREAKING VAMPIRE. It says it is off, but it is still active, you actually have to toggle it on and then back off to get it to actually turn off - every time you reboot the machine. So I contact Bitdefender tech support, they tell me that the problem is that I have malwarebytes installed on my machine, uninstall malwarebytes, repair bitdefender. I do so and the issue goes away... for about 2 days then it comes back. I review all programs loaded on my machine - there are no other forms of antivirus, antispyware, etc. so no blaming other peoples scanning tools. I try repairing a few more times. I try a couple of full uninstall / reinstalls. I try to use Bitdefender's (junk) Bitdefender removal tool - it gets caught in an infinite loop each time I try it. I try to contact their (atrocious) support / help - their response times are averaging about 2 weeks per contact.  They instructed me to run their support tool so it can capture data from my computer and then upload it to the ticket. I try to do that - it creates a 750MB file, which can't be uploaded. I write them back, 2+ weeks later: oh please usethis third-party service to upload the file.  Said service is limited to 300MB for the free service. I write-back asking for alternate directions... no response. I finally just say - fine I'll live with it for another month and a half until my subscription expires and I'll go with another vendor. I'm living with it... A couple of weeks go by. My wife calls me from a business trip, her laptop won't access her company's exchange server... company IT can't figure out what's happening... I try and help her over the phone for a while - no luck and then on a random guess I ask her to go into the Bitdefender and check to see if the SSL scanning is on... bingo... turn it off and she can use Outlook again.  This is a completely different machine, different operating system, etc. Seriously, what kind of cr5p software is this?<br /><br />Oh and I am REALLY thankful for another reviewer who pointed out that when you purchase this (junk) software from Bitdefender directly that they transfer you to Avangate to actually purchase the software and that Avangate by default turns on auto renewal.  I had to go and request an Avangate login be created (when you order Bitdefender, a Bitdefender account is created - not an Avangate account) and then access my Avangate account settings - yep Autorenewal for Bitdefender on by default.  Tell me that isn't SHADY.  Nothing about that in any way stated in my account informatoin at Bitdefender.com.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE - I'M SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING CNET, ETC. AND THE HONESTY OF ANTIVIRUS REVIEWS IN GENERAL NOW.\n",

It won't accept my password when I try to log in.  I have now reverted back to a previous backup again, will have to reenter a lot of previously completed work again.  I try to reach out for support but the chat window doesn't work (it wants me to choose my product but the drop down menu doesn't work) and the phone support is only available from 8am-5pm (while I'm at work and not able to come home and sit in front of my computer to get support!)  You would think that a company that had any real concern for customer support would expand their support hours while such a major company mistake is taking place.

      "4\tThis is a godsend (probably from Irving, God of Machines--though maybe electronics fall under the egis of a different god), but a) it's slow; and b) it needs two widgets: one a Duplicate Finder, and one a comparison panel like FastStone's that lets you isolate two to four selected images so you can compare them and choose, all online.  Otherwise, you have to get your files sorted BEFORE you upload them, and a cloud should let you upload a massive folder, edit it online, and once it's as you like it, download the nicely sorted version back to your machine/device after you've sent the original to recycling. That way your OS doesn't go so nuts, you don't get locked out of your own files, etc.  Just be aware that Amazon's cloud doesn't like LARGE pictures such as the portrait you saved at 600 dpi because you want it as close as possible to the original.  Or videos over 20 minutes, not that I have the latter issue.  The way it syncs with my Kindle is still amusing, and I must do something about that!  Maybe I meant &#34;bemusing.&#34;  Still, I can shuttle photos and drawings back and forth between my laptop (Windows 7) and my Kindle Fire HDX and my Canon MX922 (via PrintHand), and maybe not even have to get out of bed to do so!\n",

I think I have that figured out.  I have traditionally not used the feature of automatically downloading data from my bank and I think I will stick with that.  I also no longer try to keep up with investment accounts.  Maybe with being retired I may try to clean up some of the older data in my file...time will tell.<br /><br />I moved to 2015 because I was sure that intuit was about to discontinue support of 2008.

In fact they don’t even continue to show data I have entered directly on the SS this year.<br />3) Step-by Step doesn’t show which of the two businesses I am putting data on for some screens (but it correctly identifies the business on others).<br />4) Using SS, for the second business, many of the pages that come up for the first business are missing. For example I am not askedgiven an opportunity to enter any of the home office expenses on SS, so I have to enter them directly on the form. Luckily I caught the error.

The upshot is that the software is buggy and fails without providing error messages.  The worst is that the software has a serious glitch which prevents it from building a final video when you try to use common special effects.  I contacted Corel and they gave me the run-around...sending me from technician to technician and finally to 'engineering'.  I followed each and EVERY recommendation Corel made...even purchased a brand new computer!!! And the glitch never went away.  Corel never fixed the problem, finally dropped me by telling me to go to a link that would give me the status of my case...but the link doesn't work!<br /><br />This speaks VERY poorly for this company's product quality and customer service.<br /><br />If you buy this product, just hope you don't need to use the features that cause it to fail...Only use it for very simply video editing!\n",

I used WinX DVD Ripper for the vast majority of the ripping and had very few problems ~ 95% success ratio.  There are a few programs that I've tried (with time limited free trials) that worked as well or perhaps even a little better at ripping but cost $50 or more as well as having other minor issues I disliked.

      "4\tI've used Norton in one form or another for years and despite some minor issues I find it it has served me well. In my opinion it has progressed from bloated(some years back) somewhat intrusive software to a fairly low profile internet security program that works well with the kind of internet browsing that I am accustomed to. I have the same gripes as many reviewers in regard to marketing(forget automatic  renewal, you always pay more,no reward for being an existing customer). I've been buying at Amazon for some time, always saving a good chunk of money for my version until this year when with the new combined version the savings weren't there, but at the Amazon checkout I got a $20 promo discount from Norton  and picked up the 5 device for around $26, a great deal. It's also very convenient having it in your software library to for future use on new devices, or to reinstall. Be aware the installation process is a little confusing now as you now have only the software key in your library. The link to the actual software download is gone and you need to use or create a Norton account after being directed to their website and downloading the program from there. The process is not that complicated but is a little confusing, just look for the link to the Norton website and if you have a Norton account already log in and you're all set. From there my installation went flawlessly, old version removed automatically and after a reboot the new version installed in a few minutes and was up and running with absolutely no issues.I really have had good luck with Norton although I don't use every feature. Over the years it has stopped several browser hijacks,viruses, trojans, and I'm on the internet a lot.I like the fact it tells you when it's blocked an intrusion attempt so you can get out of there fast. I do occasional stand alone scans with other products(Malwarebytes, microsoft security scanner,etc.) and have never found a single thing it missed.Never firewall issues when installing applications.Having said all these good things I also understand that others have had terrible experiences with installation and customer support.Sometimes something just doesn't work good on your computer. This has happened to me in the past and although each time it was resolved I know it is a real pain when something goes wrong. Please do a complete image backup of your computer before installing any security program like Norton because you are giving it a lot of control over your computer. Then if you can't get it to work your not locked into trying to fix it, just restore your image and try something else. Anyways, I recommend Norton highly, it's worked well for me and I think it's got better over the years.That's my two cents-good luck.\n",
      "2\tA testament to modern software development. It's new, it's different, and that about sums up the positive attributes.<br /><br />Scaling in Windows 8.1 on high resolution screens is laughable. Riddled with buttons so small I can barely distinguish them from a smudge. Quicken will blame windows, but most of my other programs (often free or significantly less expensive) avoid these issues so it's pretty clear who is to blame. I have to change the resolution for my entire windows experience just to get this one program to look slightly less horrible.<br /><br />A frequent occurrence: Press a button and notice that nothing is happening...at all...not even a spinning icon to tell you to be patient. Perhaps 20 seconds later the screen flickers and you think, &#34;Ah! You ARE doing something!&#34; Eventually, a new window appears or a belated spinning icon confirms your vague suspicion that your trackpad is indeed still working. This on a brand new ultrabook where every other program flies.<br /><br />It happened to me yesterday: I want to change my Wells Fargo username. How can I do this? Perhaps a button in my account settings that says, &#34;Change Username&#34;? Oh no, silly, you need to begin by disconnecting your accounts from their ability to download transactions. Only then can you reconnect them and have an opportunity to give a different username. It's about like being told my front door is just fine because while there is no knob to open it, one can easily remove the hinges and gently lower it to the floor in order to exit the building.<br /><br />It happened to me...again: This isn't new to 2015, it's just the way Quicken has always been. I've had the product for just a few months and suddenly I'm facing numerous duplicate transactions and the familiar question, &#34;They are both identical, so which one do I need to kill in order to keep it from coming back?&#34; Operating this software is like spoon feeding a gremlin. You can try to be nice, be gentle, move slowly and try to avoid eye contact, but eventually it's going to spit food on the wall and try to bite your fingers off. Ha! And you have to pay for the privilege!<br /><br />My question: Is the software development at Intuit in a state equivalent to overseas clothing sweatshops? At a time when software can be amazing, how can a product like this be so woefully disappointing except by a stringent commitment to spending money on advertising rather than development, and making sure those developers are the cheapest money can buy (possibly to the point of being exploitive)?\n",

      "3\t\"I've been using this product on a Mac for 18 months now;  for the last 12 it has been my primary work machine.  Perhaps it worked better before, but these days it's like having the familiar Microsoft experience on your Mac:  the Mac that has worked so well and smoothly just doesn't work in so many ways when you contaminate it with Microsoft software.  Some features have simply never worked, like \\\\\"\"Show Recents\\\\\"\" in the Dock.  Other features mostly work.<br /><br />I think the most outstanding feature of this software is that I have reinstalled my Mac twice in the past 6 months because of bad updates.  In about March, Office stopped working properly after an update and AppleCare told me to reinstall the OS, relying on my trusty Time Machine as a backup in case of trouble.  Somewhat disbelievingly, I did as they asked, and the experience was smooth and easy (just like reinstalling on Windows has never been).  And suddenly Office worked again.  Then yesterday I allowed Microsoft's Update Tool to update me to the latest release, which I figured had to be safe since it was almost a month old.  I was wrong:  no Office apps would start, or in fact do anything beyond an initial half-bounce.  No errors, no process creation I could easily observe;  an amazingly silent and undiagnosable failure.  Microsoft Error Reporting did not start and had no knowledge (indeed, I think it may have been implicated according to some posts I read).  So I Google'd the update (14.5.0 I believe), and lo and behold, it's been known to make Office inoperable on some Macs and Microsoft has simply left it up for auto update anyway.  Unfortunately, instead of calling AppleCare immediately, I followed the directions from a helpful post and dragged Office to the trash.  Once I did that my Time Machine would not restore it for some reason (apparently it's been not feeling well for a while but has been mostly functional), and the solution recommended was to recover my entire Mac from Time Machine.  So I did, and so now it works again.<br /><br />(Well, except that I forgot I wasn't backing up my Windows VM, and so now I have the same old Windows experience in spades as I recreate the VM from scratch.  Like I say, they bring the \\\\\"\"it just doesn't work\\\\\"\" experience to your Mac anytime you don't want.  I hear they are working on redeeming themselves, but Microsoft has a long way to go to re-earn my trust.  (BTW, if you're curious, I have a Ph.D. in computer science and used Windows for over 20 years before I just had enough and decided it worthwhile to give Apple my hard-earned money.))<br /><br />In all fairness, I do have to admit that I first installed Office 365 for the free trial, then downgraded to Office 2011.  Since Office 365 doesn't have an uninstaller on the Mac, uninstalling and downgrading is a bit intense.  Perhaps that somehow corrupted things, although it's impressive it survived an OS reinstall and a reinstall from backup.\"\n",

It is much more user friendly than Word has ever been.  Indeed, I have spent many a day muttering about how hard Word is to use.  Unfortunately, WordPerfect lost its dominant position to Word and many of us have been stuck with using Word for many if not most of our word processing tasks, particularly when collaborating on documents with others.  This latest iteration of WordPerfect continues the user friendly tradition of the product and I look forward to using it for as many of my word processing needs as possible.\n",

It took a few weeks of doing this a few times before it's stabilized now and having had to make adjustment entries for my accounts to get them back to the proper balance.

      "3\tFor about $40 you get excellent OCR software. It does excellent recognition of fairly complicated documents (2 column docs in fairly poor image resolution).<br /><br />However its interface to scanner is so deficient, that you will likely have to resort to other software to scan paper documents. Here are the problems in build 12.0.104.167; Part #1132.25:<br /><br />1. Scanning Letter pages (8.5&#34; x 11&#34;) from automatic document feeder, results in oversized PDF pages (8.53&#34; x 11.72&#34; or even Legal size). Using other scan software via native TWAIN interface creates correctly sized documents.<br /><br />2. Scanned/recognized pages are often reordered (20 pages ADF scan on 4 CPU PC); sometimes a page is duplicated. When OCR an already scanned document, no reordering occurs.<br /><br />3. Scanner interface does not allow selection of paper size, nor the scanner interface allows access native dialog of the TWAIN driver.<br /><br />4. There is no function to crop oversized pages.<br /><br />5. Technical support while responsive, could not reproduce any of the errors, but suggested buying FineReader 12.<br /><br />Summary: It is good to have as a backup solution for OCR of complex documents, when your primary PDF editor (e.g. PhantomPDF) does not provide adequate OCR, but not very useful as the primary application for digitizing paper documents.<br /><br />It is sad that an excellent OCR backend is buried by failure to provide a simple and robust interface to a scanner.\n",

      "1\tI just did my taxes for 2014 yesterday but I purchased the software 6 weeks ago at a local store on sale. I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years but now I am done with them. Unlike many reviewers that post in December or January I don't review software that I haven't used. I used this software and in the end I wish that I had purchased something else. My review is based on actual experience and not just a review to garner votes by posting early.<br /><br />I had numerous problems and it took me twice as long to do my taxes as it should have. It kept asking the same questions over and over and I filled out the boxes and when that section was completed none of the dollar figures or answered questions showed up as correct. The most glaring was when it asked me if I had prepaid estimated taxes and I answered yes. It then asked me what amounts and I filled in the quarterly payments. When done it did not include those payments in the refund calculation and I had to manually override the data and fix it. This one mistake alone would have cost me $1200. If I had not been watching the refund amount at the top of the screen I might have missed this error.<br /><br />I used the walk me through format as I normally do and this year it was just garbage. It would ask me if a set of circumstances would apply to my return and I would answer no and then it would proceed to ask me 20 to 30 questions to which I have already answered that they did not apply. When I answered yes to a section and answered every question and filled in numbers, when appropriate, it would not use the data or the numbers and I had to go back and fill out the data and numbers again. Very time consuming and frustrating.<br /><br />Ultimately I had no trust in the way this software worked and I rechecked every number and calculation before I filed. Like I said before, one error alone would have cost me $1200. When I was completed it did a scan and it found a mistake, or so it claimed. It told me a number for my 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct. I even looked at the actual printout of my 2013 taxes to verify the number. To make matters worse it truncated the code for the local tax authorities for the county that I live in making it almost impossible to determine what it was even questioning. It stated the taxes paid to INC were wrong when the code is IN C-41. I had to manually go back to the forms and fix the error that really was not a problem and it had no bearing on my 2014 return. A simple waste of time for what it called a data collection form.<br /><br />Doing taxes is not really fun and wasting twice as much time as required makes it really a hassle. Turbo tax has lost a customer that has been loyal for over 20 year back to the days of Turbo Tax coming to you on floppy disks.<br /><br />On top of that, go look at the recent 5 star reviews. Many of them are first time reviewers posting 2 words to one sentence reviews. They use no punctuation and no capital letters. They are fake reviews.

I liked the calendar view of upcoming bills to be paid, not available in Mac version. Importing downloaded transactions works well for the most part, but I have trouble getting Mac version to synchronize downloaded transactions with manually entered transactions, so I end up with double entries.

      "2\tKaspersky Internet Security is rated as one of the best Antiviruses out there. It and bitdefender are usually competing neck-and-neck for the highest positions on Antivirus-Test websites (Like AV Test). But although Kaspersky Internet Security may be great at blocking viruses, it hasn't worked well for my computer. I purchased it less than an hour ago and, as soon as it's installed, my computer is slow and almost every web page is blocked and has to be added as an exception. The settings do not make it clear exactly what module does what, and even though I've now disabled almost everything except the file protection, my computer is still slow to load webpages. I'll keep using it for a few days to see if it gets any more bearable, but if not, it's going to be uninstalled. Unfortunately there is no way to get a refund for this product, so I don't have money to spend on a new antivirus if I decide to quit using this one. But honestly, if it keeps at this pace, for once NOTHING really will be better than SOMETHING.<br />p.s. my computer has an i7 and 32gb of RAM, there is no excuse for a program running in the background to be slowing it down like this.\n",
      "3\tI don't make or edit movies, so its not really fair for me to say it's a good or bad program.\n",
      "3\tI am pretty happy with the main software, i.e the federal return. But this is not a good option if you need to file multiple states returns. While the initial software is priced very reasonably, it only comes with one state. They get you on subsequent stats which are charged at $39 a pieces plus tax. Additional fee for electronic filing is added on. So each additional state costs more than the federal&one state combined.<br />Also not good for filing amended returns. I recently purchased NY state to file the amended return and was unable to complete the task for two reasons.<br />1. The form required (IT-203-X) is not available<br />2. The software is stuck in electronic filing mode, which is indeed required by the NY state for the main filing but not for amended returns, which need to be filed by mail.\n",
      "5\tThis is an excellent anti-virus from Avast. it also allows you to scan for hacker threats, software that needs to be updadated and the best part is it's free. I would highly recommend this software to anyone.\n",
      "5\tPC MATIC has proven to be the best protection I have ever gotten for our computers. They were invaluable when Microsoft decided to do away with support for their older models. Not only did they support when Microsoft didn't but PC MATIC completely scanned and repaired all of my files and drives and continues to do so all for only $50/year. A better deal and better protection you can't find.\n",
      "4\tOverall I am very happy with Quicken 2015. It does a lot more than I am use to. I am still exploring the software and found some features a little awkward to use but as I get more experience with the software I will adapt.  I do recommend this product.\n",
      "5\tIt is what it is. Hate tax time but this software eases the pain.\n",
      "5\tgood.\n",
      "4\tI made the transition from QB Pro 2009 to QB 2015 for Mac. Most of the features work exactly the same way, and I was able to export my Windows QB 2009 file to a Mac version of the file and import it with no problems.<br /><br />Note that QB 2015 for Mac does not do manual payroll. They want you to purchase their online payroll feature, but that is not cost effective if you only have a few employees. You will have to make all the split transactions yourself and know what accounts to use. However, you can duplicate checks and adjust the amounts in the split transactions, if necessary. Also, you will have to print your own pay stubs; I use Excel for that.<br /><br />Finally, it's not easy to adjust the format of the column headers in your invoices and checks. If you have printed invoices and checks, you will have some work to do. Their templates worked well enough for these, so it wasn't much of an issue for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "5\tI'm rating at 5 Stars based on my usage needs.  I have been a Quicken Windows customer for years and have never used all the features available.  I truly depend on the product to ensure that my accounts are updated, bills paid on time, and data is tracked for tax purposes.  No special investments are tracked, no business data, etc;  With that caveat, I had been running Quicken 2014 Professional under VM Parallels on my Mac.  It was the slowest, most exasperating experience so I read all the reviews and decided to buy the new 2015 Mac version.  The software runs fast and efficiently on the Mac now.  Account set up is quick and easy.  The downside is I never was able to convert my Quicken Win files.  Tried for two days and the converter software just kept stopping with an error.  I had done everything  Quicken support and community had suggested for converting VM Quicken files.......totally a waste of time.  Overall, if you can live with just exporting all your old data as archive and doing a new Quicken Mac install, AND are a basic user like I am, I think you will be pleased with this version.\n",

      "5\tExactly what I needed\n",
      "4\tThis definitely serves it's purpose for what I needed it for\n",
      "1\tThis software is a scam, when you purchase the software they gain full control of your computer, email and IPO address. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!! Unless of course you see the irony in purchasing a privacy product that violates your privacy more than any malware or adbot could ever effect. more ads began the instant the software was registered\n",

      "4\tDecent anti virus protection too many pop ups though!\n",
      "5\tBest software investment ever. I create home family DVD s frequently. It takes 3 hours from start to finish . well worth the cost and it is a better DVD maker than &#34;windows DVD maker&#34; that used to come standard with Win vista..\n",

      "1\tI wonder how Quicken would sell if it was a different product. Let's not think as high as a car. Maybe a TV, a refrigerator, a stove.<br />How would you feel buying a product that is put on the market with defects?<br />How would you feel if in the process of fixing some of those defects other defects are introduced?<br />How would you feel if in the process of fixing some of those defects the product becomes unusable, such as suddenly asking for a password when opening a file for which you never setup a password?<br />How would you feel if functions of the product would cease working properly such as downloads from financial institutions going awry?<br />Well... you finally decide to contact support to find out what the %^&*$  is going on and they assure you that the issues are known, that they are being worked on and they will gladly offer to sell you next year's product version which should have the particular issue fixed. &#34;Should&#34; not &#34;will&#34;, as is the case with issues with Quicken which have showed up in the 2012 or even earlier versions and in 2015 are still there.<br />How would you feel if when you are becoming fed up and you decide to voice your opinion on a public forum maintained by the product manufacturer you end up being chastised by the moderators and your comments are closed for further replies and sometimes even removed?<br />Yes... Intuit and Quicken are just like that.\n",
      "1\tThis is such a pain and so difficult.  I am a teacher and my school is moving towards Google Docs. Now I know why! When I qualified for a free version of Office for students and teachers, it wouldn't load all the way. Then, error codes came up and I had to remove it. Now, I wish to start over but there are no online services to do this.  Get a a free online suite, save the headache and money.  Microsoft is no longer worth it!\n",

      "3\tBeing a Corel PaintShop Pro user, I expected Video Studio to be more than just the Corel version of Windows Movie maker. It is fairly user friendly, but just a simple cut and paste editor, not a more robust &#34;Professional&#34; feature laden type of editor. So my review is mixed. I like how easy it is to use but I wish it could do more than what it does.\n",
      "5\tGreat starter program for those interested in architectural rendering!  I got interested in drafting very young, and while I never decided to pursue architecture as a profession, I like to do it as a hobby.  There are a lot of handy features and a nice 3-D rendering of created plans.  The price is right for hobbyists and weekend warriors who want to see what their projects will look like in the end!\n",

When I finally figured out how to access my online account it always showed that the status of my protection was offline.  When I submitted an inquiry to Avast's Customer Service Tech's they were very prompt and as helpful as could be but, for me, the software was very unreliable.\n",

Also, some information should be auto loaded when you include your previous years return. Why should you have to retype your address? Could include links to download forms.\n",
      "5\tWe have been using H&R Block tax products for years - so simple to use with online guides and videos...even I can do my taxes!!\n",

      "1\tNot pleased at all. In fact I'm going to request a refund!\n",
      "4\tHad some trouble installing because the free taxact and the delux with state are the same item. So fake credentials I created to test the free edition caused trouble. But then installing the state was a a separate product requiring a new registration. It's fair.\n",
      "5\tI have Had Norton for many years now and this is the best Norton ever! It's so easy to use I recommend it very high! You can even put it on your ipad So you do not have to remember your pass words no more. I give it a 10+++\n",

Sucks in my opinion, if you don't want to download all your transactions.<br />So it is back to 2007.\n",

      "4\tThis program works good so far, but I've only put it on one computer. I had just brought a rebuilt computer and it was really fast.....until I downloaded this program. It definitely slows down the computer. I think I am going to remove it and then try it without and see what happens. If it speeds back up, then I'll know it is the McAfee program causing the slowdown. It made me clear out my Norton and my Ccleaner before it would download. It is effective in check all site before I open them, and does warn you if the site is suspicious BEFORE you can open it. So far, I've backed off if the email or site is checked. If it only didn't slow down the computer, I'd give it a five star rating. If you don't mind slowing down a bit, it's great.\n",
      "5\tWorked great for me. About the same as last years version. The relevant changes were clearly posted on their website, so there were no issues due to that. I did encounter what seemed to be a bug once and couldn't understand the necessary steps in another situation. Both times I got quick help from a real person at TurboTax. They walked me through the steps to do what was needed. Excellent service!\n",

      "4\tIt's a tax program.  Works well for us.\n",
      "1\tI thought I could import transactions in CSV format, as my banks don't have any on-line integration with Quicken and do not export transactions in QXF format (but they do export in Excel and CSV). Manual entry is not an option for me (which is the only other way to log transactions), and paying $40 for CSV2QXF is not an option either. I didn't care for the forced web login, either - my internet went down when I was doing the install and I couldn't begin using the software until the internet connection came back and I could create a login. Looks like I got ripped for $48. Lesson learned.\n",

The 2015 version is an ENORMOUS improvement as far as banking is concerned.  Bank syncs are reliable, with just a few exceptions: 1. categories do not always autofill from previous entries (it just enters \\\\\"\"undefined\\\\\"\"); 2) occasionally, the sync does not recognize that I've already posted an entry (such as a debit receipt), so it duplicates the entry.  Anther item of frustration: When you enter a transfer from one account to another, the entry does not automatically offset in the other account - you have to post the transaction in both accounts.  The old version automatically entered the transaction in the corresponding account.  Bank reconciliations are a snap; this has saved me an incredible amount of time!\"\n",

      "1\tI abandoned Quicken after 20 years and switched to myFinance tracker (provided by Royal Bank) and now running Mint in parallel.  Both these programs are superior to Quicken for downloads of expense and stock transactions.  Even on Quicken I had to do my stock transactions manually.<br />I still have my Quicken 2011 for a stock ACB tracker (all of my previous data is there and I haven't found anything better). I tried Quicken 2014 and it was horrible (slow, lost all of my attachments on the conversion, cumbersome on .pdf attachments).  So I came to this site to see if Quicken 2015 was any better - since Mint is an Intuit product and many of their interfaces and reports on 2015 look similar. Apparently 2015 is not good as well.  So we'll check out 2016 if they can get the Mint team to bail them out!  For those of you interested - I like myFinance tracker since it shows holdings and correctly shows $US currency values - yet it would not connect to Questrade (one of my brokerage accounts) and Mint does.  The only negative with Mint so far (4 months usage) is that everything is reported in the same currency (the world revolves around the US).\n",

I just tried to process a simple credit card statement--nine transactions and no balance carried forward.  When I reconciled the transactions, the un-reconciled total never went to zero and Quicken tried to enter two large adjustment transactions in the register.  When I closed the reconciliation window and looked at the account, 12 years of history was gone.  I closed Quicken and reopened the credit card account and my history was back.  The transactions I just tried to reconcile were marked as cleared but not reconciled. The second time around, Quicken let me finish the reconciliation.

      "1\tI am Intuit's quintessential user.  I've been buying this Quicken and TurboTax every year since sometime around 1996.  I've got data from 1996 in my check register.  I've always steered others toward Intuit products.  Until now.  This is a company that has lost it's way and it shows in this product right here.  Sadly, I still use it because they're the only game in town.  I helped them create this monopoly.  Some of us should have kept MS Money in business.  If you buy this product it will auto-update itself to version 7.  Google &#34;Quicken 2015 v7 lockout&#34; and see what you get... I'm guessing a lot of angry comments.  The software locked up many folks' data files.  The corporate line... I sure hope you followed good policy and backed up so you can restore.  Look at the release notes for v8 - kind of sounds like they're blaming the customers for getting themselves locked out or misunderstanding.  You can't talk to anyone there when their software fails.  It's all online forums.  Then they arbitrarily shut down threads they don't like like an angry parent.<br /><br />This is not rocket science software, although I will confess they set the bar many years ago with the most intuitive user interface and ease of use.  That's what sold everyone.  Now they are just riding it as long as they can.  Someone smart should (will) come in and steal their golden goose because they've lost focus.<br /><br />From a frustrated user without a good option... I urge you to consider something else.  I'm in too deep.  But if someone wants to launch a competitive product please give me a shout.  I'd be glad to help.  And if someone from Intuit ever reads this (unlikely, why follow customers?)

I'm self employed and the Block product simply couldn't deal with the combination of self employed and using Obamacare.  When I called them, they said they had just received the final information they needed from the Feds in February and hadn't had time to adjust for the changes.  Their solution was to download some extremely complex tax forms from the IRS and figure it out myself.  Very frustrating and a total waste of my time and money.<br /><br />TurboTax, on the other hand, was complete and worked perfectly with this and all the other issues.  I got done very quickly (of course I had all my records and receipts together by then from the previous aborted filing attempt.<br /><br />The two products are fairly equal, though different, in their approach to asking questions and helping you work through the process.  It was easy to e-file my federal return, though I didn't want to pay the extra for the state e-file and simply printed and mailed that version.<br /><br />TurboTax is understandably getting raked over the coals for the changes they made in pulling some things out of their deluxe version and requiring an update to Premium.  I've used TurboTax in the past and this change was the thing that caused me to try HR Block.  TurboTax has gotten too expensive and this move to drive many of us to an even more expensive version is ugly.  But there is nothing else out there that works as well.  I'm going to bite the bullet and continue with TurboTax even in the face of their price policies (which are admittedly nasty).  I guess you get what you pay for.  The nice thing is that at least by buying at Amazon I got a good deal on the price.<br /><br />Overall, TurboTax seems to be a very good program and it's wonderful that they have enough professionals working on it to make the product complete, even in a very difficult situation.\n",

Also when putting hundreds of pictures into the work area, there is not a way I have found to loose all those thumb pics and start over or for the next project.\n",

      "4\tI purchased it knowing about some of the problems I read in the reviews. After installing, I experienced the problem of a script error with the error message saying it couldn't find a page on the internet. I solved this problem by editing the &#34;C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts&#34; file and inserting these two lines:<br /><br /># [Omnipage script block]<br /> 127.0.0.1 www.ocr.com<br /><br />I also read that there was a new installation file so I contacted Nuance customer support and in less than 10 minutes they had emailed me a link to get the new installation file. I then had to uninstall the software downloaded from Amazon, reboot the PC, and download and reinstall it.  After doing all this, the program seems to run quite well. It looks like a very sophisticated program. For simple OCR activities, it is quite easy to use. For more complex OCR activities, there is a learning curve. Overall, I would say it is an incredible value for the price of less than $30. I do think Amazon should have the version of &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34; that actually works available for download. I don't think one has to make the changes to the system file I mentioned above IF you have the latest version of &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34;. I might also add that there is a new release of this software but it is not even called &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34; and costs considerably more.\n",

Running street addresses is difficult and time consuming. If you want to search an intersection and drop a pin it takes quite a bit of effort and time. Additionally, there is no night mode for the map display, only high contrast. If you are used to running Streets & Trips as a search and pin system, this map system is far more complex and proves very frustrating. It has far more capabilities and settings, but is lacking in simplicity. Even when configured it does not allow for simple search and go settings. One thing I absolutely loved about it was the ability to use the GPS location to automatically search for things like gas stations and restaurants ahead of you within a specific degree.\n",

Fortunately, the main file had been automatically backed up a few days before, so I made a copy of the backup file and I am now using that file as my main file. A few days ago, there was a message that an update was available that fixed: &#34;Some customers getting an unexpected/incorrect password prompt preventing them from accessing their data file in R6/R7 version(s).&#34; I've been unable to update. All in all a very frustrating experience but I need the program to keep track of my investments and my rental expenses. So I am stuck.\n",

Spent the next 3 hours calling H&R block local, and then toll free 3 times, speaking to 3 different individuals after working my way through automated reply systems.  They referred me to a 3rd party usatax.  The first representative gave me an incorrect phone #.  The 2nd gave me a correct one.  After talking to usatax, they had no record of me, and said the error was on H&R blocks side for entering info incorrectly.  So called H&R the third time-no resolution to the problem.

      "3\tI've amended my review of Version 8 to apply to version 9.  I see that reviews for this program fall into two categories: (1) Wow, so this is how screenplays are supposed to look!  This program automatically formats them.  Awesome!  I can write screenplays now and make movies! (2) I have to use this program for a living and this program is no more glamorous to me than a plow is to a farmer.  I fall into the latter category.  (Although I envy beginners their enthusiasm for formatting and begrudge them none of their excitement at entering the world of screenwriting -- that phase doesn't last more than a few months.)  If you're a professional screenwriter, especially for TV, then you pretty much have to use this program until someone comes out with something better that fulfills all the professional requirements needed by TV and film production companies.  Sad, but true.  Sad because, since this is a business of art, it would be nice to have a really elegant program upon which to ply said art.  But FD gets the job done.  Final Draft support has been spotty over the last twenty years I've been using it. Sometimes good, frequently not.  They are quite a small company, and management has not always been... &#34;people-oriented,&#34; shall we say?  Many a show (I work mostly in TV) has suffered through innumerable glitches and crashes over the years, and there are still -- even at version 9 -- some oddly persistent problems: -- nonstandard Mac interface (for example, pressing the Command and the , keys simultaneously should select Preferences like every other Mac program. It does not.) -- still has many pagination bugs. -- still has display issues that corrupt the display of the script occasionally. -- nonintuitive interface that feels rather Windows 95 instead of Mac OS X. -- bugs in the Revision Mode presets. -- inability to set certain defaults in a new script, such as making Character Name follow Dialogue automatically.  Instead, you must reset this every time you makea new script.  For some reason, the programmers think an action line follows every piece of dialogue in every script. -- company resources spent making useless features like speaking your script out loud and using index cards instead of fixing bugs. -- thesaurus is still barebones. Not a big deal since, you know, the internet. -- spellcheck is sloooooow. If you type moderately fast, it won't flag misspells till you're a sentence or two past it. -- the &#34;feature&#34; called CollaboWriter that supposedly lets you collaborate online with a distant partner was nonfunctional, so they removed it.  It has never worked in the real world.  (BTW, it doesn't work on Movie Magic Screenwriter, either.  Do a google search and you will find that not one single reviewer or user has ever managed to get this &#34;feature&#34; to work.)   A colleague just showed me how to collaborate over the internet: use Skype!  Do a video call, and then check the little box that says &#34;share screen,&#34; and your partner can see your entire screen as you type!  This is awesome and works very well. So not having Collabowriter is no biggie. -- it be nice to have a default zoom level and window positioning on the screen, so that scripts don't open up all over the place and at different sizes.  Here are features that are either useless or annoying to professionals: -- text-to-speech, speaking your script out loud. (This is a pretty risible feature.) -- writing management and statistics. -- watermark your script.  This one is laughable.  The sure sign of an amateur is the fear that someone will steal their script (sorry!). Also, don't put your WGA registration number or copyright number on your script. Another sign of an amateur. -- full screen mode.  Seriously?  I know it sounds like I’m being harsh, but they could’ve used the resources/time spent making the above useless features to FIX BUGS.  Sorry for the shouting ;)  New features that professionals will probably never use: -- script notes enhancements. Script notes are a pain. You have to click on that stupid little box. Only one writer I know uses them, and we won't read them in her scripts if she does. But whatever works for you... -- character highlighting. At tables reads, the scripts are printed out as hard copy, so the colors are a bad idea. Some actors highlight, some don't.  Neutral features: -- revision colors.  Haven't used that, so I don't know if it's useful. -- scene navigator and character navigator. I think they add nothing, but I could see how someone might find them useful.  Great new features: -- replace character names globally.  I know, only one great new feature. Not promising.  They are a small company, and they don't sell millions of copies of this software, so I think they make the bulk of their money by selling upgrades to new versions.  They're not making enough to have a big customer service department, and the quality of that service has gone up and down over the years. At least now someone from the company is replying to Amazon review complaints.  The number of professional screenwriters numbers in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands at best. So they need amateurs and the curious to buy FD to stay in business. Amateurs and the curious can turn into professionals, so this is a good thing, IMO. So I forgive them their pandering to that market.  We were all beginners once.  I pointed out a few bugs in a previous version (6x), on the phone with the head of the company, and he told me (and I quote): &#34;Yeah, we're not fixing those.&#34; True to his word, it's 3 versions later, and he has not fixed them.  He didn't even have the decency to lie to me and say he'd address in in a future incremental upgrade!  You know, in Hollywood, when you don't care enough to lie -- that's bad news.  He also made on odd confession to me. He said &#34;You know, we don't sell nearly as many copies of this as people think we do.&#34;  Hmmm...that explains a lot. He was on a podcast recently and he kept talking about the &#34;40 people at his company who work hard every day to make this program great.&#34;  40 people?!?!  Holy dog doo. That's a lot of people ignoring bugs! I wouldn't brag about that, man.  Anyway, version 8 and 9 for Mac works pretty well these days and I've had none of the fatal crashes and bugs of yesteryear.  And you also can't blame us writers for holding residual grudges for all the times we've gotten burned in the past by this program.  Writing is damned difficult, and when the actual software gets in the way, it's a ready target for our frustrations that may be stemming from the writing process itself.  Anyway, if you're a professional, you have to use this if you're in the studio/network TV system and you already know it. No matter what any review says.  (Unless you don't need compatibility with a production company). If you're not a professional yet, but you really want to be someday, you may as well learn its quirks now.  That way you can suffer along with the rest of us.  Bottom line: it works.  It ain't elegant, but it works and it's solid these days -- I haven't had a crash in several years.  (I've had pagination bugs and corrupted scripts but no crashes.  Which reminds me -- SAVE your script after every few lines.  Command-S on the Mac.  I do it like breathing now because otherwise sadness will occur when files are damaged.  Which is rare -- but it happens.)  When they update the interface and address current bugs, I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars.  But for now, they get 3.  They lose stars for 18 years of frustration and failing to address current bugs.  But they gain some for finally being stable, otherwise I'd give them a one.  The pagination, spellcheck, and revision mode bugs are the most annoying and persistent. These are the ones that annoy every writer every day. If they fixed these, it would go a long way towards making happy users instead of begrudging users.  Footnote: I'm writing this review as a professional screenwriter, for better or worse.  For those just starting or contemplating starting a writing career, software is the least of your concerns.  Don't obsess about it.  No software in the world is going to make you a writer.  No book is going to make you a writer.  No stupid course/seminar/retreat is going to make you a writer. Go get celtx, a free screenwriting program and see how you like this writing thing.  If you love writing and like your work, then go buy FD.  It's a decent enough plow.  Here's the best screenwriting advice I can give you: find your own voice. Don't try to fit in. Be original. You'll feel better and get hired more and be rewarded by the industry.  (Unless you want to be a TV hack and turn out CSI episodes, then please suppress any originality.  On the upside, the check from CSI will always clear and you'll have a very nice car.)  Happy writing.\n",

I would never have bought this if I knew how easy it was to update Q2007 to run on the latest OS X release. Found this out after I purchased this. Go to the Quicken website - you can do the upgrade for $15 and keep using your current files. Hope this helps\n",

      "4\tI have always loved Norton products and have been using them almost 10 years. I am a big gamer so I require my computer to be speedy and efficient. I haven't had any problems with this software slowing down my computer or getting in the way of my computing which seems to be the major complaint for virus protection. This just hangs out in the background and keeps me running smooth and problem free. I like their user interface too. Its pretty straight forward with the more advanced options hidden away in the settings menus.<br /><br />There is one component that seems to have been removed from last years Norton 360 to this years re-branded Norton Security: Registry Cleaner. I'm not happy this was removed. I get that registry cleaners can be harmful but I would like to have the capability available. - 1 star\n",
      "5\tActually this Avast Free Antivirus 2015 exceeds my expectations for it.  I don't know why but my computer seems to operate smoothly and more quickly once it was installed and the McAfee Total Protection software I had before was deleted.  This surprised me, but also the professionalism that the Avast company demonstrates in the web appearance and accessibility of its software product.  This software has already blocked a virus or two since I've owned it, and it is easy to open up, and once it does, it has several features you can investigate.  My advice to those who are curious are to go ahead and try it, and use it for 30 days.  You might find out it works well for you too.  Certain speed bumps to look out for are 1/Avast popups that tell you there is no firewall.  With my Windows 7 Home version, I have a Firewall installed with it, so I don't need one.  You should check to make sure you have a Firewall protection already for yours if you get Avast.  If not, Avast will sell you one for $19.00.\n",

Plan on seeing pages that never load. Plan on seeing &#34;We're sorry, we ran into a problem. Please try again later&#34; (The ONLY site I ever have a problem downloading software). Plan on having problems where you have to call some guy in India and read to him a ***35*** digit number and then type in a ***35*** digit number that he gives you - FOR NO DETECTABLE REASON!! Plan on seeing some of the weirdest problems while using this software that you can find 5000 solutions to on the net... none of which work. Plan on NEVER getting a usable answer for ANY Microsoft-related problem from ANY Microsoft site (EVERY TIME you end up chasing your tail on Microsoft sites then go to Joe Bob's website where there is usually a simple fix to a stupid problem.

The new Quicken is not able to recognize past reconciliations and is asking to add some transactions to balance the account, Of course the transactions from older reconcilistions are there but Quicken 2015 misses them. Work around, you answer yes when Quicken 2015 asks to balance the account by adding transactions. When you are done with the reconciliation, just delete the new additions. After this work around it stops asking and works as usual (For Now!). Have a nice day, Fabio\n",

It makes the most common views harder to access, and goes to generally less contrast in presentation so you have to look harder for the buttons you need.  Its almost like Intuit is looking for changes to make to they can force you to purchase the newer version, via threat of discontinuing payroll service.  One of these days an equally complete program will come along without a required re-purchase every 2 years, and I'll buy it instead.\n",

What I do not like is Norton keeps trying to get me to install their ToolBar and after repeated Nos and Donot Ask Me Again it still continues.  But I guess other Internet programs have their own crap they are trying to get you to download.  Their ratings were very good with PC Mag and a couple other testing labs that I reviewed.  In all, having previous success and ratings helped me select when 360 expired. I assume thats why Norton keeps going up in $$$$\n",

      "1\tI purchased Quicken 2015 less than 8 months ago for my Mac.  It has been cumbersome from the start.  It is difficult to reconcile and needs to have separate debit and credit cards.  I have updated the program every time an update comes along hoping it would address these two problems but it never has.  And now, I was entering two entries into the register and it locked up and I could not enter or delete the entry.  I called for help and after a considerable amount of time on the phone he told me I would need to purchase a 3 year service program for $299.  I told his I had used the older version of the program on my Mac for years and had never had a single problem and I was not going to pay that for them to help me.  He then told me I could pay $149 for a one time service help, I again said no; then he told me they would give me a bargain for $110; that is still considerably more that I paid for the program itself.  I am going to go with a different banking program altogether.\n",

Most of my clients either use QuickBooks online or Xero.  I don't feel link QB online competes with Xero because Xero gives you an all inclusive platform and unlimited users at a per company cost.\n",

      "4\tIt never ceases to amaze me how some people write their reviews (I often wonder how many of the extreme reviews, positive and negative, are genuine??) …  I am half way through my 30-day trial and I will likely be purchasing this software.<br /><br />I read the reviews on this software and I have a couple questions …<br />1) What does the reviewer mean by, “rendering without sound”? There are volume/gain (decibel) slides for each individual audio track and the  master volume and all have a left-right balance. 2)<br />2) Why do so many reviews say they have trouble downloading? Downloaded and ran on the first try. I’ve used this program for about 20 hours over the last two weeks and I have not had a single problem.<br />3) Why don’t people read about what they are being and know what they are paying for? You won’t get a Maserati if you’re paying the price of a Ford (not knocking Ford). This is not a several hundred (or thousand) dollar video editing software suite – this is a low cost/low budget video editing software package that does exactly what is says it will do –nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the reviewers – at first, Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum wasn’t very intuitive to me, but the more I have used it, I have learned the “intuitiveness” of the software. The couple times I used the Help feature, it really was helpful. I had used very basic software before with the capability for one video and up to 2 audio tracks. Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum has numerous editing options to help create a top quality video – but remember, you will likely not make a feature film production with this, but for family, and YouTube, etc. this is software is more than adequate. Bottom line – for a very reasonable price you get a reasonable product with Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum.\n",

      "5\tIf people wonder is this worth it the answer is yes.  If you are serious about writing this is a great product.  The negatives are difficulty adding on to more than one device (hey final Draft, we have office computers and home computers and tablets BTW - and you have special pricing for students how about special pricing for writing teams?)  Anyway, you can put it on more than one machine but it's a bit of a challenge.  compared to my earlier version that I has been hanging onto for some reason for years this things works amazing!  No glitches at all so far months in and it's got some great features.  The bottom line, you can get your work done quicker and keep your brain free for story elements as the program does most of the work for you when you type. Love it.\n",

Delorme has the information, since their &#34;Roads of...&#34; printed series show it, but it's not in the software product.<br /><br />The lack of availability on OS X is also very unfortunate.

I paid for it and received no information that I would not be able to activate the product. I then spent over 30 minutes on hold waiting for Microsoft support to pickup. Once the guy picked up, he asked me for the product key (took about 15 minutes to get it across to him since he was not a native English speaker and he could not understand me) and then he told me he could not help me, but if I wanted to buy MS Office again I could go to Microsoftstore.com to purchase it. Thanks Microsoft!\n",
      "1\tWell, this is pretty horrid. I got a new computer and thought I'd get the new version of Word. I told the salesperson I wanted to work completely offline and said this would do it. Well that was a lie. I can not figure out how to use without signing in with a MICROSOFT password (seriously???) and then being told all documents would be stored in the cloud. Well, that is seriously NOT what I want. I have tried and tried but nothing seems to work to just open it and use Word. This is seriously disappointing and if I can't figure it out in 5 days, I'm going to uninstall it, ask for my money back and install the old Word and work very hard to make sure I use as few Microsoft products as possible in the future.\n",

Now I'm conversing back and forth with a Total Training rep about the situation. I was offered a one year subscription to an online Adobe course for my troubles. I give the DVD lessons all the praise but, I wish I could view the lessons on my Mac. As of now, I just have to view the lesson on another platform as I follow along; no biggie. The lessons are great, well constructed, very informative, highly detailed, clear, user friendly and easy to understand and follow.\n",
      "1\tI have been using Quicken for over 20 years, and generally like it. I recently upgraded, and this version is HORRIBLE. I used to be able to input transactions very quickly and easily. They have made it laborious and buggy.<br /><br />When I installed the upgrade, it a) combined two entirely separate accounts, my personal financial account and the financial records for a small business I am keeping books for, into one account. This is disastrous---we are COMPLETELY separate entities and our financial records should NOT be comingled. b) For some reason, when I open Quicken now, it shows 3 versions of most of my accounts. I had to delete the superfluous ones by hand. And, it won't let me make adjustments on some accounts.<br /><br />The new Quicken is AWFUL. If I could, I would uninstall it, toss it in the trash, and go back to my old version. Unfortunately, my new computer requires the upgraded version. This is so bad that after 20+ years, I may be switching financial record keeping programs altogether.\n",
      "2\tHave been using Quicken for nearly 30 years and find it very useful in managing the financial part of my life.  This version works but it seems slower than the previous version I had (2012).  Would not have upgraded if not for the Intuit policy of disabling on line account access after a period of time.  Nothing else in this version is worth it.  Oh well?\n",
      "4\t\"I've been using Quicken for over 25 years so I'm pretty familiar with all its components. This latest release doesn't bring much to the party and in fact, made some changes that are a bit irritating. I wish the engineers had remembered the old saying, \\\\\"\"Don't fix what isn't broken.\\\\\"\" So here are my thoughts:<br />*  When performing a 'One Step Update' with my bank account, Q2015 renders a blank screen. My previous version populated the screen with my different accounts and showed the update progress for each - I liked that better.<br />*  When I put the cursor in the Payee field and press Ctrl+D, the list of payees appears instead of deleting the transaction. My previous version worked properly.<br />*  When entering a new transaction, the auto -populate feature under Payee appears and totally blocks out the Payee field so I can't see what I'm typing. This never happened before.<br />*  The Budgeting feature has gotten so cumbersome, I don't use it anymore. I now do all my budgeting in the check register with 'Bill and Income Reminders' that are \\\\\"\"auto entered\\\\\"\" a month in advance.<br />*  Under \\\\\"\"Reports - Easy Answers - How Much Did I Pay To\\\\\"\", when I put in a name, the report always comes back empty with the message, \\\\\"\"Quicken cannot find any transactions ...\\\\\"\", even though there are plenty of Payees in the check register with that name.<br /><br />With all that said, I still depend on Quicken completely and also use QuickBooks for my business.\"\n",

First-tiime user; I am a PhotoShop guy much of the time.<br />Still, there are many times when I don't need all that PhotoShop has to offer, and Lightroom does very many of the PhotoShop<br />functions-albeit in somewhat less sophisticated ways.  Very User friendly.<br />I understand that PhotoShop and Lightroom can be made available to us in &#34;cloud&#34;, with a monthly subscription that ensures you are<br />always using the latest version of both.

      "4\tThis year the other TAX guys got too greedy so I switched to this.<br />Took a little longer than to pick up the way it does things but seems ok to me.<br />The other guys can stick it.<br /><br />Even used direct deposit.\n",
      "1\tI have been a customer of Quicken since Microsoft Money was retired many years ago (2009?). Quicken was a difficult transition but I made it. After years of bugs and constant troubles, I continued to think that it would get better over time and just wait for the next version or update. Sometimes it worked fine even though the categorization learning mechanism is very outdated. This version worked reasonably well until the last update.<br /><br />I use online/one-step updates from my financial institutions to load current data into Quicken regularly. I have it scheduled to keep things updated regularly so that I can review them on a monthly basis.<br /><br />I have multiple personal accounts of various types and two small business accounts in the system which are separated by the Tag feature. This is a pretty limited implementation and they could have done a much better job with it. This is best used with single small businesses but they do claim to support more than one. I can tell you it is clunky.<br /><br />When the online sync/download from financial institutions works, it works reasonably well. However, Quicken arbitrarily drops online download support from each version of Quicken every couple of years to force you to purchase a new version. My recommendation to my mother to purchase this software years ago has cost her hundreds of dollars to keep up with the simple feature of online updates because of this fact. Also note, if you use Mint, do not expect Quicken to have the same financial institutions. For some reason Quicken is FAR more limited than Mint.com is even though they are supposed to be the same company.<br /><br />Downloaded transactions are categorized based on a semi-decent logic based on previous categorizations I made in the past. Transfers among accounts are finally recorded properly most of the time now after years of trouble with that throughout the previous versions.<br /><br />Mobile/online sync was supposed to be a big new feature, but itis merely a cheap balance visibility tool. My banks and credit cards have more advanced mobile software components than Quicken does. The online sync portion looks identical to Mint and offers far fewer features than Mint does.<br /><br />The latest update corrupted my entire data file by somehow destroying my local file password and my synced data as well. According to Quicken, the only option is to restore from backup.<br /><br />Mistakes happen, it is true. I am a software developer and consultant and have made them myself. However, that is what QA teams are for and beta testers etc. After this many years of using this product and seeing issues with each release--it is no longer a mistake in a random software release.<br /><br />This is a pattern of poor quality and terrible support from Quicken that I have personal knowledge of over at least the past five years or so. This particular failure has been the last straw for me. I have lost months of data and categorization work. Yes I should have backed up every week and I usually do, but life happens. I actually thought that the auto backup would run like the scheduled updates do. It does not.<br /><br />Please consider my experience with multiple versions of this product as background and a demonstration of my previous hope and investment in the product.<br /><br />Even if you try it and have no issues for a little while, you cannot trust that it will last.<br /><br />As a developer and long-term customer of Quicken, I am finished--do not take a chance because it is a big name company and one of the few commercial options today. It is not worth it and it will not get any better. It has not over the past five years.\n",
      "1\tThis is clearly a product to avoid.  The subscription can be extremely problematic for travelers.<br /><br />- If you are contractually obligated to safeguard the privacy of client data, ask some hard questions about how Microsoft Cloud stands up to real Security Guidance and checklists.  Marketing and convenience is still way ahead of actual security. Clouds are data centers run by real people (who just happen to have direct access to your data).  Cases where thousands of credit card numbers or thousands of tax returns are compromised most likely originate behind the firewall of a data center.  Someone with access issues a query or grabs a file and this data walks out the front door on a USB stick or is lifted over a VPN connection.  I actually had a Cloud vender tell me &#34;control is not security&#34;.  I can guarantee you that an absence of control doesn't exactly answer any of the items on a hard security checklist or STIGs.<br /><br />- No clear road map for Office.  This matters.  There is still a need for an Office Suite that does not put you in danger of a reduced functionality mode during extended stays at client sites where Internet is not available (YES - SUCH PLACES EXIST). No answer to the basic question of having a version of Office that is fully functional at all times in the absence of an Internet connection has us looking hard at alternatives to Microsoft Office.<br /><br />- Customer service and activation is absolutely &#34;IRS Call Center&#34; hellish.

      "4\tMcAfee is okay and it also isn't. For more than a decade I've been using McAfee. I've never had a problem with their software in any aspect (installation, firewall, etc). As long as I've had a continuous subscription, my computers were always protected well. However, it is always cheaper to purchase a new subscription every time rather than renewing through McAfee directly. Thanks Amazon.  I am an existing user of McAfee and I purchased the online code to extend my subscription. Here's the thing though: there is no possible way of doing so either through the program itself or on your account profile on their website. I ended up going through some unnecessary troubles to do so. I'm not going to go into it, but thankfully the only way I've found to extend a subscription was through a link another reviewer had posted:  http://home.mcafee.com/root/ECards.aspx?affid=0&pkgid=274,275&cid=83215&culture=en-US  I hope this review helps some people from avoiding a headache.

They claim that it's an issue with Apple or Adobe or both, but it's obviously not. You can print all the instructions and help pages, which are also Adobe and on an Apple. Awful.

I have been using Quicken for several years, and on about June 1 every year it corrupts the file so I no longer can use last years version and have to upgrade the software.

      "1\tNever had any problems with quicken upgrades until 2015 which is the poorest excuse for software, and especially an upgrade, that I have ever experienced. Two nights ago I downloaded/bought it. Next morning I do the updates since software released. Forgot how many, but they were numerous. 2015 must have come on the market less than half-baked. Was on support hold for more than 45 minutes without talking to anyone. Finally, yesterday evening, I used chat. That was around an hour of time. When we ended, I could open it. I didn't try doing any updating of accounts or anything else because I had had it with Q 15. This morning, I started to do my account updates. After I clicked on updates it wanted a quicken ID although in preferences I marked no passwords. Quicken ID won't recognize my password; so I go through the Forgot Password exercise in futility about 4 times. Each time I change, each time it doesn't recognize it. So, I close down, I restart, and guess what? I cannot even open a quicken file until I log in with my Quicken ID, which is a phantom.  If I until I'm presuming I have to reinstall 14 since they removed it during the 15 installation process. Not only would I not recommend it, I would highly discourage anyone from making my mistake.\n",

      "4\tI hadn't used Quicken for a few years and was feeling like my financial life was getting away from me.  It was good to get things back in order.  Intuit is trying to balance the graphical expectations of users with performance and has yet to strike an optimal balance.  In fairness, my desktop PC is a bit on the old side, but it is not wimpy.  Sometimes Quicken can take 10-20 seconds just to save a transaction as it updates all the related accounts and windows on the screen.  However, it works for me.  I like how Intuit has done integrations with some financial institutions.  With my credit union, for example, I can initiate a transfer from within Quicken and execute it automatically without having to go to the website.  I can't imagine going back to not knowing what's up with my financial life, and Quicken is the only tool I've used that has given me the understanding I need.\n",
      "4\tI have used Quicken for years and it meets all my needs.  I do not do anything super complicated.  Just bank accounts and a few investments.  This upgrade was a little frustrating in that I had problems with the one-step update getting all my accounts to update.  It would ask me for a password, but not save the password.  I got it figured out by removing and then adding accounts, but it was frustrating until I got it figured out.  All the reports and categories work well and are very helpful.  The budget is very helpful also.\n",
      "2\tTrying to install from the online PC code is a nightmare!! The web site Amazon tells you to go to redirects you to another site.

They force you to download some technical assistance program first.

Well, my backup was a month old, and it did not include the latest bills I added, and all of the ones I already paid came up as &#34;past due&#34;. I had to go back and go through all my bank transactions manually to check which ones I paid and which ones I did'nt.

Navigating from accounts or reports is un-intuitive and all of the items have moved from where they were in the old version.

So far it's been very stable, only had one crash (and that was probably due to me not being patient after I entered a transaction and tried clicking somewhere else). A little slow, but nothing I can't live with. Even with the one crash, it still remembered all my transactions I had just entered, including the one it crashed on, so I didn't have to re-enter anything.<br /><br />I was afraid it would not sync correctly with my accounts (again, after reading all the bad reviews), but it synced up perfectly with them and has been running smoothly (3 credit card accounts, and I added a loan account very painlessly). It won't sync with my bank for personal banking, but that's my bank's issue, not Quicken (small local credit union, chooses not to support Quicken). Backups work fine, account syncs work fine, couldn't be happier other than the slight lag (that and the one crash is why it's 4 star and not 5).

While other art software has caused feelings of frustration and disappointment; SketchBook Pro allows me to experience the joy and creativity like that of traditional drawing and painting.<br />  My only reason for giving it a 4 star rather than a 5 star review is for the fact that it didn't download correctly from Amazon.

All my accounts had to be reconciled.  when calling support their response ( after waiting 1.5 hours ) - restore from backup an try again.  Activating the download functionality in the new version was quite complex and took another couple of hours.

I kept the software thinking that Intuit would surely fix the problems, but they persist and their patches are a joke.  I would ask for a refund, but I am past my 60 day window.

      "1\tI have been a Quicken user since 1993 and have purchased upgraded versions every 2-3 years. Until this year, I have endorsed their Quicken product. Quicken has been doing a series of patches in late April through today. Their R5 & R6 patches didn't block access to my data file as it did to so many others. Last week they announced that an R8 patch was available for download that would insure that you wouldn't have any future issues in gaining access to your data files. Even though I didn't have file access problems up to this point, like a fool I took the bait and download the R8 patch yesterday (5/30) and instead of protecting me from future data access issues, it now asks for a password to get access to my data file that I never set up, so Quicken has now blocked my access to my data. The irony of all of this is that they claim that these patches were to improve security for mobile app users.  Well they have accomplished that goal. No hacker can access my data including me. Tried to use chat support yesterday together get help fixing this,  but chat was also broken likely due to overload. Before you buy this product do yourself a big favor and do a web search for Quicken 2015 patch R6, R7, R8.  This is all from the same company that gutted major parts of their TurboTax 2014 Deluxe product and forced users to buy their most expensive version (they did end up doing a refund). Once I get to a support person, I know that it will involve hours of investment on my part to get back to current data. If I'm lucky that process can start today.\n",

      "1\tAlthough a long-time McAfee user, I have been on the fence about McAfee for some time.  The only reason I renewed last time, at a ridiculous price, was because I have a 3 PC license that is shared with family members' laptops.  It was the path of least resistance to just renew rather than find new software and hassle with installing it on three devices in three different locations.  This time I purchased Total Protection2015  for 3 PCs at a great price and tried to install it today.  I tried to enter the product code too many times to count on different devices, different browsers, etc. etc.  I just kept getting a message that said my product code was not entered correctly.<br /><br />I finally bit the bullet and called McAfee's extremely unpleasant off-shore tech support.  I have no issue with off-shore call centers if the person I speak to is understandable and can understand me.  This was not the case. This was the best part of the call. They were completely unhelpful, rude and offensive.<br /><br />I now have software I cannot install, but that's OK.  I wouldn't use McAfee under any circumstances at this point.<br /><br />Thank you McAfee.  You made my decision for me.  I will take my business elsewhere and will not be back.\n",

My main complaint is that what was installed by \\\\\"\"iyogi\\\\\"\" was limited to 1 user (whereas I purchased the 3 user version).

HOWEVER...last year (2013 tax year) I used it for taxes, just like normal. I took money out of my retirement fund when moving from a job, and entered it in when TT asked me. Everything looked good, submitted the return and got a check a few weeks later. In December 2014 I got a letter from Maine Revenue Services. Scared, I opened the letter to see that I had been audited, and my return had a mathematical error! I thought &#34;no way, I used TT and it always has all types of advertisement that math errors are double checked..ect..&#34; I pulled the 1040 from my cabinet and sure enough, the program MADE A MATH ERROR, to the tune of $900ish. I thought I must be doing something wrong so I took my return to HR Block and they went through it. Yes, TT had made a math error. The program skipped over line 19 (or whatever line it was) and did not add it to the total for taxable income. ARGH. Maine gave me 30 days to pay out the error, with interest and penalties. I had to cough up $572 on the spot...due to a math error from Turbo Tax.<br /><br />HERE IS THE WORST PART - and the reason I felt compelled to write the review. I contacted Intuit and asked for help before I paid the IRS. They did not respond. I waited until the deadline for payment and ended up paying the IRS to prevent further issues. I re-contacted Intuit and sent me an email a month later saying &#34;Dear Mr. xxxxx,<br />We do apologize for the delay in processing your claim.  We are moving as quickly as possible to process all claims but are a little behind.  We cannot provide a specific date by which your determination will be made but we will complete our analysis and provide your resolution just as soon as we can.&#34; Wow, thanks. This was January 31.

One of these versions caused many users to be unable to open their data files.  The file is essentially locked and unable to be used.  Extremely frustrating for someone like me who has many years of data accumulated.  On 5/27/2015 Quicken released version 8, which supposedly fixes the problem.  However, for users who were already affected by the issue, there is no remediation.  According to Quicken, &#34;This patch cannot unlock files that are already locked. This could not be resolved with product update without adversely impacting the data quality any further.&#34;  I'm not sure how &#34;data quality&#34; could be impacted more than completely unusable.<br /><br />Quicken has a 60-day money back guarantee.  However, months later when they release a patch that causes all of your work to be lost, their is no recourse (other than to write a review warning other potential customers).  I do realize that I can find a backup and can begin the process of recovering all the data since that last backup, but I simply shouldn't have to.  After years of using Quicken and putting up with frustrating issues, I've decided to move on.  They've lost me.  If you are considering Quicken, I would suggest looking for other tools like EveryDollar, Mvelopes, YouNeedABudget, GNUCash, or something else.\n",

Even after I set the software to keep my original file protection password, it locked me out of my file. It is terribly unstable; it does not consistently open correctly and often locks up. I have been using Quicken for years, but this one has finally convinced me that Intuit just doesn't care enough to produce quality software.\n",

      "1\tI really was hoping this would be a great solution to the ever increasing need for back-up and file storage.  It most definitely isn't. I easily have 7-8TB I'd like to live elsewhere than my RAID and numerous other misc drives I use to make redundancy especially redundant and this finally looked like a product I'd subscribe to.  I've been a Prime member for 4 or 5 years but never tried the free storage I have, preferring the Dropbox account I've had forever.<br /><br />So, what's so bad? Many little things, but let me just focus on the big 3:<br /><br />#1 is a limit of 20 minutes per movie file.  So forget about backing up your kid's music/theater/dance/sports events here unless you stopped and started while recording and every one of those files is less than the 20 minute limit.  Not really a solution for someone who puts the camera on a tripod, hits record and walks away.<br /><br />#2 - The app appears to be written by a software engineer dropout.  (Harsh?  Yeah, maybe - but I'm really angry at Amazon for getting my hopes up for a reasonably priced Cloud solution with massive amounts of storage) I thought maybe it would be something like Dropbox but it's just a big window that says &#34;drop your files here&#34;.  So you drop your files there but you have no control where they go on your cloud drive.  The web interface is is better - at least it sort of emulates a hard drive file structure interface - but it lacks an intuitive paradigm when it comes to managing file & folder structure (took me awhile to realize you had to put a checkbox next to a folder and then scroll down to the bottom of the page and select &#34;rename&#34; in order to rename that folder.  Yeah, that makes sense....)  But guess what?  If you have large files over 2GB you HAVE to use the app.  If you're using the cloud to back up an external drive (and who wouldn't?) and you want that back-up to have the same file structure as the drive you're backing up (and who wouldn't) you're going to haveto use the app if you have a few large files on there that exceed the 2GB limit unless you want to back up 1 file at a time...<br /><br />#3 - It doesn't work reliably.  Ever.  Maybe I should put this as #1, huh?  You put some files uploading & walk away expecting to find them uploaded when you come back, right?  Doesn't happen.  It shows a progress bar that looks like it's working, but inevitably you come back to a warning message that tells you there were errors, the progress bar isn't moving anywhere and you're left wondering what to do next.  The activity monitor tells me I'm still pushing data at a paltry 1.5MB/s but the app looks like it has stalled out (I have a 120U/25D broadband connection, btw).  And because the app interface doesn't actually show file/folder structure what exactly are your options now? You can't see from that window what has uploaded and what hasn't and even if you could, are you supposed to pour over countless folders and files and try to figure out what doesn't need to be uploaded? If you quit, restart and drag your hard drive contents to the app window again it will just start dumping files to the root level again...<br /><br />Argh.\n",

The new button to update all accounts is nice but to update only one account it's a few more key strokes. The new version appears to be better at matching transactions meaning I have transactions that are scheduled and/or memorized and it now matches the downloaded transaction with my scheduled transaction, ending up with only one transaction in my register instead of the old version, I'd end up with two.

Rather than list the dozens of ways it's inferior, just trust that it will take extra keystrokes to do anything, and many features are just plain AWOL. I've given up managing my investments on Quicken and just use it to balance my checking account and credit cards, and even there it sucks. The reconciliation process is infuriating, and it takes multiple clicks just to enter a transaction. Making a payment has extra fields for no good reason. And when I went to delete all of the securities from my account since I gave up on them, it won't let me. Even worse, it insists on updating their prices, which takes forever, and there's no way to turn it off. I'm desperately seeking an alternative, but QuickBooks for Mac, which I also use for my business, is awful, too.\n",

For years, prior to adding GrimeFighter, my computer always booted up without any problems. Peter said it wasn't GrimeFighter, but that my computer just happened to go bad at the particular moment I added GrimeFighter. He said he could fix it, but it would cost me $175. I personally believe they added the problems to my PC in an effort to sell me a $175 fix. I would not recommend Avast or GrimeFighter to anyone!!!!

I think it's overpriced and I started using Microsoft's free Security Essentials for our laptops because we don't use them as much.  I think that this version of Norton Security doesn't bog down our two desktop computer's system as much, but it still has some annoying bugs that keep cropping up across versions.  It offers more features than Microsoft's free security software that I find helpful, like the identity safe--otherwise I think it's a bit complicated.  The interface isn't straight forward if you're typing to do som things on your own.  It is, however, a set it and forget it type of program and it will scan your system for viruses when idyll automatically.  Sometimes you manually will have to download updates as the updater sometimes doesn't do it automatically.  Most of the time you can just install it and let it do it's thing without bothering with it.<br /><br />All in all it's a good product with a hefty price tag offering more than freeware.\n",

      "1\tI used to have Pinnacle Studio 15 on my old computer and I really liked it. When I saw this was on sale, I decided to give it a try. The program works-- right up until I try exporting anything longer than 12 minutes. I've worked with Pinnacle Studio pros on troubleshooting this issue but it's been almost a week now and there's been no workable solution. I have to convert my videos with Handbreak to constant FPS because otherwise the audio will desync, but any converted video starts to pixalate as soon as it gets past 12 minutes. So either my audio is off or my video looks like crap. No setting tweak, adjustment, or format changes the result. It's beyond frustrating, and renders this software useless to me. I'm still looking for a replacement in my budget, but my advice is to avoid this version of Pinnacle. It's just not worth the trouble.\n",

I couldn't figure out where my child tax credit was being applied, though it was in the end, just hard to find it. But it's much cheaper than turbo tax so when price is considered I bump this from a 3 to a 4 and turbo tax down from a 4 to a 3. In the end this gets the job done just as quickly, just not as automatic as turbo tax for me. I do file housing interest and stock sales along with regular w2 income.\n",

The program continually locks up and I have to kill it using Task Manager and start over.  If I try to schedule a split transaction, it doesn't show up in my In/Out/What's Left graph.  I have found that the customer support chat representatives are not very knowledgeable in solving the problems, either.  Their stock answer is to uninstall and reinstall the program, even when you tell them you have done this more than once already!  Currently there is a password issue with Quicken, and their advice is to not sync Quicken with your mobile app.  I really feel I have paid for a program with features I can't use because they don't work.  After using this program since the fall of 2014, you would think that by now they would have fixed the bugs, but it seems to be as bad or worse than it was then.  DON'T BUY THIS PROGRAM!!!\n",

Then for some unfathomable reason that app was pulled and replaced by a new &#34;desktop&#34; app which is just a drag and drop interface for upload and a button for download... a GIANT STEP BACKWARDS. I felt the service has great promise and the $59.99 for all you can use is compelling - except due to the prehistoric nature of the desktop app, this storage solution at least for me is not a very useful daily solution. It's lack of features put is more on par with an archiving services like Carbonite and Backblaze and not a cloud file management solution.\n",

For me it works great, I have a checking account, a few credit cards, loans, bills to track, etc.  For this straight forward money management it works really well, and kudos to Intuit for updating this with a cashflow forecast which I consider to be absolutely mandatory for keeping track of your finances.  If you are like me, this is a streamlined a simpler version of the Windows edition that works very well (so far anyway) and is pretty easy to get used to.  The import of my file from Windows went pretty well, though I did find a couple problems I needed to fix, overall though it was 98% accurate in the transfer.<br /><br />Now for the people who wouldn't like it:  If you have complex finances and use the windows version to its upmost potential, you will find that Mac version very simplified and lacking in advanced features you may be used to.  As you can see from the many negative reviews, people hoped this would be the version that finally gave the Mac the advanced Quicken everyone has been waiting for.  If those are your expectations then you will be disappointed.  However if you are like me and just need to keep track of bills, accounts, auto update cleared transactions through the bank, see a cashflow forecast, etc. then I don't see why you wouldn't like Quicken for Mac 2015, because it does those things very well.  5 stars for people looking for a simple finance manager with several nice options, reports, etc.  In that respect I like it better than any other Mac finance software.  1 star for people hoping for a faithful replication of the robust windows version, which this clearly isn't.  3 stars on average.\n",

I have been on the phone countless hours with what can only be described as the worst tech support I have ever experianced. If you call tech support you will be put in touch with a rep that will most likely know less then you. You are then sent countless emails describing what to do to fix the issue or issues but the emails do not contain any information with regard to which issue they are helping you with, so you have no idea which suggestion is going to fix which problem. When I insisted on a level 2 support I was told I would have to pay for that service, ARE YOU KIDDING ME???<br />Their final suggestion was to install Kaspersky internet security 2014 and down grade my Firefox to a previous version. How's that for a fix? I will be asking for a refund ASAP. This will be my last Kaspersky purchase!!!!<br /><br />If you were thinking about purchasing this product, do yourself a favor and move on, there is other security software that is just as good if not better, it may come at a slighly higher price, but you get what you pay for I suppose.\n",

      "1\tI downloaded this program and had absolutely no trouble with it at all.  It was a breeze to follow along and file my return.  Until I got to the part where I hit &#34;efile&#34; and my return was rejected.  It seems that someone else had used my Social Security number already and therefore, I was required to file a paper return.  But, not to worry, the program happily allowed me to do so and just to be extra safe, I sent the return via FedEx.  All was well until today when I received a cashier's check from a bank in California.  California, mind you, NOT from the IRS.  The check had a stub attached with the following fees deducted from my refund:  $27.99 tax preparation, $34.99 deposit product fee paid to bank, $20.00 reprocessing fee.  Yup, $82.98 was deducted from my refund without anyone disclosing the possibility of them.  I did a little research and the company receiving the &#34;fees&#34;, Santa Barbara Tax Product Group, is somehow in business with H&R Block.  So, without advising me in advance or giving me a choice when I printed my paper return, H&R Block conspired to &#34;take&#34; nearly $100 from me in fees, in addition to the amount I'd already paid for the software download.  This is a sneaky and underhanded business practice and had I been made aware of the fees in advance, I would have prepared my return by hand.  Thanks H&R Block.\n",

      "4\tAlthough many have complained about the loss of features in this version of TurboTax, I personally did not lose any needed functionality. I like TurboTax overall because it offers complete flexibility in the choice of an interview format versus entering data directly into the relevant fields. As a veteran tax self-preparer, I prefer the latter, but occasionally find I need to use the former for new material. There are aspects of TurboTax that are frustrating. I particularly take offense with the nickel and dime approach to adding additional state forms and the like. It's interesting that in New York, where additional fees to file electronically are illegal, there is no added cost to e-file, whereas in New Jersey, there is a substantial added cost.  It's Deductible could be a lot more functional. The degree to which I have to settle for selecting low-cost items that don't really match the more expensive ones I actually donated is frustrating beyond belief, but using It's Deductible does lower the risk of being audited. It's time for a major overhaul of the program in that respect. Finally, although cut and paste finally do work, the built-in tables and worksheets do not come close to approaching the functionality of a standard spreadsheet. After all these years, why can't one still delete or insert a row? That's just absurd.  One major bright spot is that by buying TurboTax through Amazon, I get a 10% bonus on my refund by taking it as an Amazon gift card. That is so nice!\n",

      "1\tWhat a joke. I had used Quicken for Windows previously with only minor issues, but my experience with 2015-Mac is just awful. The application is fine if all you want is a check register, but user beware if you want to link your bank account.  My &#34;online balance&#34; began to aggravate me because my bank isn't very quick about posting transactions. No big deal, I'll just deactivate the attachment to my account, right? Wrong. It's not an option. Like, at all. So, feeling like an idiot, I go to Intuit's website and sift through their help section. I hate having to do this, because I'm fairly tech savvy. As it turns out, the only helps for my particular issue (deactivating a link to a bank account) were from early 2012. That seemed like an oversight, but hey—it's a pretty new upgrade. Perhaps they're just behind on their tutorials.  I connect to their support chat, and I'm fed the exact same four-year-old instructions. I politely tell the rep that the options he is telling me to click simply don't exist anymore. I then send him screen shots of my application, as well as the drop down menus and settings windows that he wanted me to click through. His advice? Delete your account and start over.  Seriously? Your recommendation is rebuild? Laughable.  That's what I get for not listening to the reviews posted. I had had marginally good experiences with the Windows version in the past, so I thought it was just the normal Mac complaints (guys, we complain a lot...). Turns out these complaints are warranted.

Many of my financial institutions available on Mint are not available on Q15, such as American Funds or MOHELA student loans. Nor does Q15 allow automatic downloads like Mint.

I was forced to move from Quicken 2012 (which worked great) this year because they no longer supported...which means the financial institutions would no longer update your accounts.  I updated to Quicken 2015 thinking it would not be a problem since I've done this many times in the past.  First observation, all the fonts are off, using Q on a Mac with Parallel, nothing lined up like it did before.  That issue was never solved to my liking , and then, with update 7, I lost all my ability to track spending.  If you go to Quicken community you'll see the outrage of users and just think, 7 upgrades since Jan release.  It tells you there is huge problems.  Not wanting to loose my data which goes back to 1999 I downloaded Quicken 2013 which works perfect!  I realize i may only have support for another year (stupid policy) but I'm hoping Intuit will get their act together by the end of May 2016 when support ends.  Maybe Q2015 will be on release 17 by then and they'll get things fixed.  DO NOT BUY Q 2015!!!\n",

In the most recent release of this product, it automatically assigns a password to your Quicken data file, making it inaccessible (since you don't know the password and Intuit isn't able to provide it to you).  Apparently this problem has persisted through two releases.  Intuit now allegedly has a version that fixes this problem, but unfortunately you will NOT ever be able to access the current version of your file.  Quicken suggests restoring a backup copy from before the problem occurred. Unfortunately the most recent backup I have that doesn't have the password problem is more than a week old.  Intuit apologizes to me for the &#34;inconvenience.&#34;  If they regard the loss of more than a week's financial data for a company is an &#34;Inconvenience,&#34; then I suggest they are in the wrong business.

      "4\tOverall it works fine.  And, due to the price, I'm happy.  It was the cheapest one available.  $29.99 to make my $750.00 computer's Blu-ray player work was definitely worth it, as having a Blu-ray player was one of the many reasons I bought the computer I did.  However there is one thing that I find bothersome.  However, it probably wont as be as big of an issue for you as it is for me--unless your internet turns off at night due to parental controls, as mine does.  This is what bothers me: You need to be connected to the internet when you first load a Blu-ray.  Otherwise you'll most likely get a message that says: &#34;Unable to connect to verification server.&#34; Or, the disc will just be extremely laggy and messed up.  Normal Blu-ray players connected to TV's don't need the internet, and I'm not the most tech-savvy person in the world, so I never expected this problem.  The only time I watch movies is right before bed while I'm dozing off, or at movie theaters.  I can't stand watching movies when there is perfectly good weather outside to be in.  However, unless I get the Blu-ray disk in before the internet connection turns off, I won't be able to use my computer (which is the easiest to use when I'm in bed) to watch the movie,  because the disk wont work unless I'm connected to the internet.  Other than that, the player works great.  And overall I'm still happy I got it.  I just have that one complaint.  I'm curious if all Blu-ray software for computers requires constant internet connection, or just this Macgo one.  If other Blu-ray software doesn't need an internet connection, I definitely would have paid $20 extra to not have to be connected to the internet every time I want to watch a Blu-ray.  (I haven't tried DVD's yet).  If it didn't have that one issue I would've given it a five star rating.  And, seeing as most of you won't have this same issue as me, (because most of you don't have internet that automatically turns off at night), I would still recommend it for you.  It seems like decent software.\n",

Why should I *still* go on paying for a software that I would have owned when creative cloud wasn't around? Why would adobe won't give me the option to update and fully own the software (especially if I purchased previous versions of it?)<br />It is a slap in the face.<br />More so when you can't open your files after you decide to call it quits with your subscription.

      "1\tSo I've used Quicken for 15 years to manage all of my personal accounts including reconciliations and paying bills. This version is truly dreadful. While some of the features feel marginally upgraded from my 2013 version, what is royally frustrating is the password requirement on opening your QDATA file.  The first time I converted the data I took 4 hours to reconcile my accounts and set up each account for electronic downloads.  When I closed the program and opened the next day, the QDATA file required a password to be entered to open the program.  What??? I never set up a password for this.  None of my passwords worked. So the link that says forgot password asks you to contact quicken and have them unlock your QDATA file.  Okay. So I did and after online chatting with customer service for 90 minutes and being passed back and forth, they gave me a secure login.  I uploaded my file on 5/11 and was told that the file would be unlocked in 48 hours.  I connect with Quicken help on 5/15 because - Surprise! No one had unlocked my file.  After talking to Quicken help for another 60 minutes, I was told that the team was working on it and that I would receive an email letting me know when it was unlocked. But I was urged to simply start the entire process over as it may be quicker. Well, now its 5/25. Has anyone from Quicken replied to me? Not a chance.  I then REBUILT the data again yesterday and spent two hours setting up my accounts again. THIS time, when prompted to enter a password to secure the QDATA file, I made sure that this option was turned OFF. I go to login again, and guess what file needs a password? To spend this much money on something that is a step backwards, and with that type of customer service? Forget this! Quicken just lost a lifetime customer - not again for me.\n",

It requires additional clicks to just to select an option. McAfee, you need to hire a designer for your UI. When a path from A to B is all that is needed, you shouldn't add XYZ in between A-B. From a glance, you seem to stress &#34;subscription&#34; to your service as your number one goal for the UI. I don't need the subscription box to occupy 1/4 of the program's window.

      "4\t[[ASIN:B00M9GTHS4 Quicken Deluxe 2015]]Works just fine for my needs, but sometimes one-step downloads don't work perfectly, mostly because each financial institution has its own software systems and it doesn't always match up with Quicken.  For example, Advisory or Management fees may be represented by simply removing shares, instead of sale of shares and cash used to pay advisory fee.  Capital gain/loss therefore difficult to determine when tax-time comes around.  Was happy with 2014 Deluxe version, but was informed that in 2015 linkage with financial institutions would deteriorate somehow if I didn't upgrade to 2015.  A while back, Quicken stopped providing IT support and some dubious outfits claimed to be official tech support for Quicken.  Thankfully, Quicken now offers tech support again, but there was 35 minute wait to get call through the one time I used it.  These are nuisances of the modern tech world, and overall Quicken does the things for which I bought it.\n",
      "4\tEven though the upgrade policy is evil, which forced me to buy this, I did not experience most the problems that are mentioned in other reviews.  They say it is really buggy, but I think it's pretty much exactly the same as Quicken 2012.  I did have a problem logging in, because you have to establish an Intuit ID with your email address.  I had done this years ago, but it failed to tell me that I already had one.  Instead, I had problems logging in, and luckily I remembered the answer to the &#34;favorite pet&#34; question that was set up years ago.  Then I was able to reset the password.<br /><br />Many people mistakenly assume that since they force you to have an ID, then their data is &#34;stored in the cloud&#34;.  That is not the case.  Intuit is just wanting to track who their customers are, and have ability to communicate with them.  I do think it should be optional, and I think it's wrong to force this on users.<br /><br />If you buy Quicken every two years, it is $25/year expense.  It is not that bad, compared to other tools.  I vowed to not buy it again, after I read these bad reviews, but we were going crazy, scrambling for a good replacement tool for it.  Until someone makes a better one, we're pretty much stuck.  I will still be on the lookout for for a replacement.<br /><br />Quicken has good reporting and searching.  The split expense functionality is too clunky, and sometimes it doesn't save it.  The memorized transactions get annoying, as they remember too much, and you have to go and clean them up.  Other than that, it's a reliable tool, that I've used for over 10 years.\n",

Having used many similar products, I can easily say that this one is my favorite...\n",

I can't believe that Intuit would think it's acceptable to take away features working in my software and then force me to upgrade to get them to work again.<br /><br />I will never buy anything associated with Intuit again.  I will vote with my dollars against this company.\n",

Not many people are aware of this internet security program but I have never had a problem with it as far as malware and what nots. My suggestion is that when you install Comodo; you should use the CUSTOM setting and disregard the other offerings (Geek Buddy etc.) so you just install antivirus and the firewall.\n",
      "1\tIt's completely broken. I was using Quicken Premier 2012 and was forced by Intuit to upgrade to QP 2015 in order to continue to download transactions. In the process I went from a smoothly functioning program to one that is so buggy its impossible, literally, to use. Most recently, it decided that I had password protected my file (I did not) and it refuses to open at all. I tried contacting Intuit; the wait is on the order of an hour. Obviously others are experiencing similar catastrophes. The must be the worst &#34;upgrade&#34; in the entire history of software. A disgrace. A disaster.\n",

      "4\tLove the program. My business is small, but it has to deal with the same giant problem that every business has to, which is cash flow. QB has everything I need to track where my money goes and how it was spent. The only drawback is that Intuit makes you buy a new version of the program periodically or you are cut off from online banking services until you upgrade.  Based on the program's merits though, I would highly recommend QB Pro.\n",
      "3\tI do not find TurboTax as user friendly as it used to be!  Your tech support people upgraded me because the deluxe no longer handles many relative ordinary situations TT Deluxe used to. So I must commend Amazon for staying on top of their suppliers.\n",
      "1\tAs a long-time Quicken user I am deeply disappointed in the circumstances which cause me to post this poor review.  Something awful has happened to Intuit's commitments to quality assurance/product testing, and customer-first focus.  Quicken has been buggy now for several years - just Google any version to see some relevant red flags - but the 2015 R6 and R7 releases have been systematically, inexplicably, and inexcusably corrupting user data (QDATA files) necessitating a restoration from backup and uninstall/reinstall of earlier versions of the Quicken software.  In addition, it appears that Intuit lost control of its patch portfolio so now the most convenient way to find older (working) patches is through a 3rd party entity.  I would strongly encourage you to avoid this software until Intuit has righted its ship and restored a reasonable track record of product reliability again.  I'll be happy to walk back this review when that happens.  I rely on Quicken, but the company has put me through hell, and they have trashed my trust.  Caveat emptor!\n",

It is impossible to get the software to do something you want it to do.  You have to do everything they way the software demands.  I don't know what other options are out there but SAGE 50 is complete garbage.\n",

      "5\tThe program works as advertised however, their directions are less than explanatory. If you're locked out of one computer you will need access to another computer to order, download and execute the program. If you want to burn a USB you will need to buy the Professional version for 29.99 You will also need to know how to boot your computer from a device other than the hard drive. Most computers use the F2 key to interrupt the boot process and allow you to change the sequence. For example: if you burn a USB then the computer must boot from the USB in order to activate the program. Insert the USB into its slot, start the computer and continuously press F2 until the &#34;boot screen&#34; appears. Select USB and then follow the program instruction. From start to finish the process took me two minutes. SOME computers, like HP, have a selection screen that shows, just prior to starting Windows, an option that will stop Windows from starting. Example: I needed to reset the Windows 7 password on a friend's computer. She has an HP Pavilion. For about two seconds, that interrupt screen shows and gave me a choice to press [esc] to boot from a different device like the USB. So on her machine there was no pressing F2 as the computer gave me an option screen. So know your computer and know which device you're going to boot from. The program works.... if you take the time to understand your computer's boot sequence.\n",

One of the new features, the Credit Score tracker, does not work. I have read several community posts on Intuit's website and it seems to be a problem with many users, although some seem to be able to track their scores- after trying work arounds. I have also noticed that sometimes when I enter a transaction from the upcoming transactions lists, the transaction doesn't post, it just disappears.

      "1\tAfter using Quicken for over 20 years, with regular upgrades to new versions - I am hopping mad due to a recent patch.  When the patch was installed, it locked me out of my data file. Waited four or five days to get an update, when they said the issue will be resolved in the next patch, but no indication as to when that will occur.  Now, 7 days on, still no update.  So, anxious to keep up with my bills, I installed a previous back-up, as they suggested, only to be now locked out of the file.  The instructions posted do not even mesh with their own menus.  I reluctantly have to say, after being a loyal user for 20 years - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.\n",
      "2\tI bought this because there is a unresolved problem with MS DVD Maker.  I was hoping this would be an upgrade from the free DVD Maker that comes with Windows 7.  PowerDirector is powerful, but they only include a couple of menu templates, and you cannot customize them as you can in DVD Maker.  They expect you to download free templates that users make, but most of them are not very good, unless you like anime characters.  There are thousands, but I have gone through about 1000 already, and cannot find a simple, classy menu that I need.  Since they are user-made, they are not really professional looking, and I don't have the skill or time to make my own.  You can purchase packs from Cyberlink, but I don't want to spend the additional cost for something I would think should already be included with the purchased software.  I think I am returning this as it really doesn't suit my needs for a simple, complete DVD making software.  EDIT1:  I just tried burning a DVD and after 1.5 hours of converting, I got some kind of burn error.  Going to try one more time and then I give up. EDIT2:  I was able to create a disc image, then burned my DVDs from that.  I am undecided on keeping this or returning it.  I don't need most of the features on this application.\n",

      "5\tOne of the most convent software subscription available. I would go as far as to say all software subscription should be designed and implemented as well as Office 365. The Home includes nearly all the Office applications (the exceptions are Vision, Project, and SharePoint Designer), unlimited OneDrive cloud storage, and Skype minutes (really don’t care about this). It allows for 5 separate installation and access to the full mobile Office version; the mobile version doesn’t count towards your installation limit.<br /><br />I was very impressed when that I was able to link my sister's Microsoft account to my Office 365 subscription so she can download and use Office without knowing my Microsoft credentials. She also received OneDrive unlimited storage.<br /><br />Something else that impressed me was Microsoft's forward thinking. They seamlessly allow multiple Office 365 subscription to be signed in to the same Office installation. This allows for quick switching between account if required. Honestly, there's not many reasons you will need to switch accounts. However, because MS allows multiple active account for the same Office installation, I am able to access my personal OneNote notebooks (via Home subscription) as well my notebook stored on my work's SharePoint / OneDrive for Business (have Pro Plus subscription from work too).<br /><br />P.S. OneNote is awesome and Adobe's Cloud CS subscription is worthless next to Office 365.\n",

      "5\tThis is an absolutely fabulous piece of software.  I've been making my own greeting cards since 1994.  I mostly used Create-A-Card.  I had both versions - the one from Hallmark & the one from American Greetings.  Those are very easy to use and come with a lot of content.  But I had quickly outgrown the cartoonish images.  But I continued to use the software because it was very easy to put together a greeting card & I could usually import the images I obtained from other websites.  I ended up buying this from HSN during a crafting or scrapbooking sale.<br /><br />Many of the negative reviews of this application mention having to buy content.  The program comes with a voucher to buy content ($10) from DaisyTrail.com - at least mine did.  Plus, Daisytrail also offers some free digikits.  But IMO, you're paying for this powerful software application, not content (like Create-A-Card & apps that are specifically greeting card programs.)  But you are not tied to DaisyTrail for your content.  There are many other sites where you can buy content and even get some free.  If you buy on sale, some kits are a dollar or two, which is less than the price of a nice greeting card.  (My current favorite place (other than DaisyTrail) is TheDigiChick.)  Or, if you are very creative, you can generate your own content.  I'd say comparing CraftArtist 2 Professional with dedicated greeting card programs (like Create-A-Card) is like comparing Photoshop with Gimp or MS Paint.  If all you want to do is crop & rotate images, MS Paint will suffice & Photoshop would be overwhelming.  So if you're looking for software with a lot of content included, this is not the app for you.  (Which may be why they call it CraftArtist rather than Create-A-Card!)<br /><br />OTOH, if you want the freedom & flexibility to get content from other websites or generate your own, you will LOVE this program!  It is extremely powerful!  The digikits from DaisyTrail integrate easily into the program with the click of a button, after you buy & download them.  If you get content from other sites, there are video tutorials on Youtube (from DaisyTrail) that walk you through the process of integrating them into your own digikit.  I've purchased a lot of content from other websites and that includes many &#34;frames&#34; from other websites.  When I dropped one into CA2 and then dropped a photo onto the frame, the photo was treated as simply another layer, rather than aligned into the frame.  But I found a Youtube video that quickly & easily walked me through fixing this & now I'm using the frames I've purchased from other websites.<br /><br />This software also is good for digital scrapbooking, but I don't do that.<br /><br />IMO, this is a brilliant program that takes making greeting cards to a whole new level!& download them.

When I received the card, I contacted Symantec support and added the subscription to my existing account- so I'm now good for almost 2 years on up to 5 devices.  I (will) give kudos to Norton for actual support:  A couple weeks ago, my fiance had something suspicious on her machine.  At first I started to dive head-on into trying to dig it out, but I remembered I'd just installed Norton.  I opened up a chat with Norton, their support tech troubleshot the machine via remote control (LogMeIn).  I wasn't entirely happy with HOW he worked toward getting rid of it- resetting Firefox (eliminated all plugins, add-ons, history, cookies, etc.)  In fairness to him, he DID tell me beforehand, but I didn't realize 'resetting' Firefox meant FLUSHING everything.  So, while I didn't like their solution, it wasn't as though they did it w/o consent.  And I WAS impressed that a real person was there to help at 6 on a random Tuesday.

Not wanting to wait in yet another tech support queue I started looking into upgrading to Win7. The first requirement was to install Vista Service Pack 1, which I did. On a hunch I ran the Quicken downloader again and it worked! I still had a problem and went back to Quicken chat support. They had me download a patch and now everything is working. I downgraded Intuit because I feel like they should have known to make sure my Vista was at SP1 and because they seem to make it hard to contact them directly for support.\n",

This version of Turbo Tax was sufficient for my purposes of paying a mortgage and having just a few investments needing to be reported and I received my federal refund in a nice turnaround time of about 2 1/2 weeks.

I just don't find it as intuitive to work with, it doesn't seem as easy to enter or change or match up downloaded transactions with my Bill Reminder transactions and it doesn't seem to automatically match up the downloaded transactions either. I've been working with it for about 2 months now and it still feels difficult. I will say that it did an excellent job transferring from Windows over to Mac, pretty seamless.\n",

I purchased the 2015 Quicken Mac because on paper it was supposed to be as capable as the Win Deluxe.  There are still a few holes in the Mac version's capabilities.<br />  The nightmare was trying to migrate our Win 2012 data to the mac using Intuit's Convertor program. It failed on Parallels and on our Win 7 PC repeatedly to create the .qfx so I finally gave up and went with a .qif and am going through the process of relinking external accounts and reconciling balances.  Intuit needs to do much better in programming to allow long term users like me to upgrade from ANY previous version as the need and capabilities demand.  In this area they get one star.<br />Overall, Quicken (and Quickbooks) are tools I could not do without to keep my family's personal finances in order. In this area they get the 4 stars.\n",

I would strongly recommend getting Quickens for Dummies book as it does take quite a while to figure out how to set it all up. It will walk you through it in a more logical manner like: how to download the banking statement, how to split the transactions, how to move it from one category to another, to reconcile your transactions and, to set up the Budget spreadsheet.  The book will help you understand the sequence of \\\\\"\"how to set up your account\\\\\"\".<br /><br />BUT, once you get the knowledge down pat, it is great once you start putting in the financial data.  It really helps visually to see where your money is going and areas to watch your spending.  I have not done the tax section yet as I am figuring that part out.

I have been using Quicken for more than a decade and have come to rely on it for managing my finances, however, the last few releases have only brought problems.  I would have expected enhancements to the software to actually make it better and easier, but all I see is expensive updates that are buggy and problematic and no real feature enhancements.  I use the Premier version, and it is a joke.  They give you your credit score, which is nice, but I don't think the program does anything that the Deluxe version doesn't do.  I'm a very unhappy customer, and the program crashes unexpectedly while doing fundamentally basic things. I've lost hours of my personal time dealing with the many problems I have had using this product.<br /><br />Latest debacle:  They pushed out an update which I downloaded and tried to install.  It crashed and said I was not connected to the Internet, even though I was.  I was finally able to download and install the update, and when I went to open the program, it would not accept my password that I've been using for years.  What a shame.  Luckily, I'm now in the habit of backing up the data file every time I use Quicken so I can restore any time a have a crash or something like this happens.  Over the last 2 weeks, I've had to restore the data file from backup 3 times!!!  Who is testing your updates and program upgrades???  This is a joke.<br /><br />Intuit:  YOU SHOULD HANG YOUR HEADS IN SHAME.  YOU HAVE NEGLECTED THIS PROGRAM FOR YEARS AND FORCE EXPENSIVE UPGRADES FOR NO REASON.  YOUR PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS DON'T SEEM TO BE QUALITY CONTROL TESTED AND THE MESSAGE BOARDS OUT THERE ARE PROOF OF THE TROUBLE CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING WITH YOUR PRODUCT.

I am so used to booting up the program everyday - seeing a dashboard that includes all my finances so to see where I am and potentially what decisions I need to make for that week or month.  It's addictive but a powerful personal financial tool.  You can imagine my dismay after upgrading to 2015 Premier from 2012 - to have on-going quirks and now a situation where I cannot access my data file - and the whole program is useless.  Upon contact (twice) Quicken people have given me two different &#34;fixes&#34; - but they finally admit a problem with their two most recent updates (R6 and R7) that is probably causing the problem.  At last count some 850 users have the same complaint - according to Intuit's website. Apparently Quicken's Mobile App has something to do with the problem - if the app is left signed into during the update - it renders the data file useless (password not accepted).<br /><br />What irks me is Quicken is slow to fix - still not fixed as of this writing - and those of us who are dependent on this tool are left stranded.  The adage &#34;up a creek without a paddle&#34; comes to mind.  This debacle has me researching other financial software that perhaps have a long history of stability.  My long love for Quicken is ebbing and is causing me to seek other alternatives.\n",

      "2\tThis was the original review I left for the Windows install. I work across many platforms, and have been using Amazon Cloud for a while, so had to figure out what was going on. This is the original review, followed by an update:<br /><br />*****Original Post******<br />Works much better on a Mac than Windows because you can actually move stuff into directories that sync like Dropbox. But it's a complete fail on Windows. The desktop app is pointless. It allows you to drag and drop files, but you don't get to tell them where to go, nor do you have access to your files and folders on the cloud without proceeding to the web, where you then have to manually select and browse to where you want to move and download your files. There isn't even a way to use desktop syncing software because there is no &#34;amazon cloud&#34; drive to sync to on the Windows desktop. It's ridiculous and this is leaving Amazon almost completely out of the cloud competition. All the free space in the world doesn't make up for the pathetic interface. What's so frustrating is that it seems the infrastructure is there, it's just not giving you full access that causes the hang up. Same with their cloud music player. I love having access to all of my music, but the lack of features in the player and complicated functionality (how in the world do you remove something from the library?!) is just intolerable. I can't imagine that the photo library is going to improve much either. Amazon really needs to get their stuff together, because they are completely missing the boat on this one.<br /><br />*****UPDATE******<br /><br />Ok, so the reason I was getting the directories on my Mac was because that was an old install. So this is to confirm that the available app for Mac works the same as Windows.<br /><br />HOWEVER, after a loooooooot of digging and researching and trial and error, I think I'm starting to realize why the change was made. I gather that the idea is to be able to collect all your data fromvarious sources and allow you to access from anywhere (like every cloud does); BUT, it is actually preventing you from syncing all of your machines or devices with it because you could potentially be putting an incredible excess of data on every system. This is actually a valid reason for not wanting to use a lot of cloud services. It's also not a very good system, and sometimes not even possible, to move your data to a specific local cloud directory to get it to sync. So while I think Amazon caught onto this in time for the big &#34;unlimited data&#34; push, they haven't offered very good alternatives. So far, the only thing I've found to work is Allway Sync, which takes advantage of the Amazon Cloud Drive API that is now available to allow you to setup syncing. I'm trying it out now, and it seems to be working ok, but this only runs on Windows; I'm really needing something to work like this on Mac. I think it will soon be more accessible, but for now it's amazing how little information there is to try and access this cloud drive! The other issue, is well...what happens next. So you sync or backup all your data, and then you move to another machine where you need to access it. Again, that Amazon desktop app is almost useless. The only thing it's really good for is being able to toss stuff up to the drive, like in an emergency, in a completely unorganized fashion. You hope it all gets there because there's no cancelling or pausing, and you'll just have to remember to go online at some point and move it to where it actually belongs. If you want to retrieve any of your data, you basically have to go online, browse, select your files or folders, choose download, which then saves your files as an archive to your downloads folder, which you then have to extract and move to where it belongs. It's painful. Again, you could use Allway Sync (or hopefully something else that works as well) to simply do all this for you, but shame on Amazon for not making this process just a tiny bit more simple for its users. Would it really even be so much to ask to retain the dropbox type folder sync structure, and just have the option to flag how things get synced and unsynced? (yes, I want to always sync from here, no I do not want to ever download this directory to this machine). I wonder if Amazon just assumes that too many people will upload several terabytes of data which would then get unknowingly pushed around between too many devices, and wreak havoc on every server. Because the unlimited plans are so affordable, maybe that's why if you really want to use them, you have to do enough research to actually figure out HOW to properly use them! There just has to be a better way! I think Amazon was in a rush to try and beat out the cloud competition, without flushing out a good consumer-friendly plan. I personally do still have some faith that this could end up being a great solution for me, but it has to get better.\n",

I paid the price, and then had significant problems with the upgrade itself - I resolved myself after about three hours of uninstalling, installing, restoring, etc. Now I am not able to download bank or credit card activity correctly, if at all.  Today, my download for one bank account included transactions from 6 months ago (already recorded and reconciled).  From another account, nothing would download - and there are about a dozen transactions that should have downloaded.  I had to enter everything manually.

      "3\tMicrosoft confuses me. They are slowly eroding their own footprint and creating product alternatives and begging for someone else to take away their business, perhaps Google if they ever offer offline usage. I hear that's coming soon. The real bummer of this product is that Outlook alone costs as much as this product does. There is no add-on price or conversion to Office. You have to buy an entirely new Office license. Essentially Home and Student is a &#34;teaser&#34; to induce people to spend $109 just for Outlook. I didn't bother. I bought an alternative product for $40 and was done with it. In an era when email is a necessity, to bundle it separately is a foolish idea by Microsoft. No one but large corporations will spend that money on Office Pro which, on Amazon, you can get for less than $200.<br /><br />For $100 it is a good deal as a first time user to have Word, Excel and Powerpoint - can't deny it. People who do aren't being honest. And having a 3 PC license... this is still reasonable. I've used Thunderbird as a free alternative which works pretty well for email.

Users then must manually correct the errors. In fairness, small business owners will find Home and Business useful for both personal and business accounting, although Intuit's Quickbooks Online, despite the PayPal errors, is easier to understand, use and get accurate reports.

      "3\tQuicken just keeps getting worse and worse.  Current version of Quicken is buggier than my old Quicken 2012.  Online access is worse -- no longer allowing one-click updates for multiple financial institutions. Quicken 2015 also requires all my online banking passwords to be stored in the cloud by Intuit, instead of just residing on my PC.  That seems a big security risk.  I wish I could simply have paid for continued online access for my Quicken 2012.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no serious competition to this product if one needs relatively sophisticated financial software (e.g., it is necessary to keep tabs on a variety of investments held in different financial institutions).  There are better and cheaper alternatives if one wants financial software that just pays bills, manages checking and savings accounts, and tracks one's cash flow.  If that's all you want, I strongly encourage you to try an alternative to Quicken 2015.\n",

      "1\tI'm regretting this purchase. As I sit on chat with Quicken, I've been informed that updates to their software have caused issues with passwords. As in your password will NO LONGER WORK. Just randomly happened after having the software upgraded from 2014 to 2015 for about 2 months now. The password removal tool does not work either. I'm kicking myself for spending nearly $100 from a forced &#34;upgrade&#34;...\n",
      "2\tSo I downloaded this directly from Intuit.  Have been a user for years.  Was running 2014, which had some issues, but never anything like 2015.  The electronic accounts quit downloading data.  Worked with Quicken technical support via chat.  Took over two hours, but it appeared that we got everything working (I was focused on my checking account).  A couple of days later, I noticed the savings account wasn't updating so I repeated the same Deactivate/Validate process; however, this time, the file validation of the QDF file would not recognize my password on the file (another feature of 2015 I wish I would have never accepted).  So after several tries of entering the correct password, I just blanked out the password line and hit enter.  Lo and behold, it completed validating the file, opened up quicken, and life went on.  I worked in Quicken for about an hours, closed it, then remembered I should try to download the savings account transaction.  Password not accepted.  Neither the correct password, nor the blank password worked.  Contacted support the next day.  The automated password removal tool uploaded my file, then hangs.  No message, nothing.  Soooo, off we go to their password support team.  This was Sunday night/Monday morning, 05/18.  Four days later, still no Quicken, and still awaiting an initial contact from the password removal escalation team.  I had a chat session today, 05/21, at 1200 CT.  My feedback on status of case...they started looking at it.  They should contact you today or tomorrow.<br /><br />Arrrghhh.  Why is it taking so long?  Is the product really that bad that it takes them 4+ days to fix a corrupted password?  This used to be a really solid product, I no longer hold that opinion.  And the front line customer service sucks.  Unfortunately, there aren't too many other options.  If you are not already a quicken customer, I would say look around at other options before you buy it.  You may never have an issue, but if you do, get ready forlots of frustration when dealing with their customer support.\n",

The computer froze on the start up screen and would not go past the loading screen, except for to get to the &#34;Your computer did not shut down correctly&#34; page. I called tech for McAfee, and they transferred me to 3 different departments, none of which were able to do ANYTHING. They gave me instructions on what works for a Windows 7 computer, after being told I have Windows 8. My favorite thing was when the third guy asked me to open Internet Explorer, after being told I couldn't get past the start up, loading screen.

      "1\tFor years I've used Quicken 2007 for Windows, but wanted to switch to using a Mac. My use of Quicken is very basic: I use it to fill out pre-printed checks. I don't use Quicken to track investments; reconcile my bank accounts; or manage budgets. I was stunned to discover that Quicken for Mac, unlike the 8 year old Windows version I use, doesn't allow a user to enter multiple checks without a ridiculous number of additional button clicks.<br /><br />In the 2007 Windows version, a user enters a check's details on a screen that looks like a check and hits the enter key. The program responds by logging the check's details in a check register and eliminates the data on the virtual check, but leaves the virtual check open for the user to enter details of another check. Pretty simple.<br /><br />In the 2015 Mac version, everything is the same except that after a user enters the first check's details and hits the enter key, the program responds by closing the virtual check screen. This requires the user to navigate up to the top level menu, click &#34;Transactions&#34;, and then click &#34;Write Check&#34; to get the window back. In other words, the Mac version requires two additional clicks for every check you write. Pretty stupid.<br /><br />I requested an immediate refund.\n",

      "2\tI've used TurboTax for ten years without encountering a single blip. The programmers made tax preparation fun--until this year. The first problem occurred when I discovered the Premier version no longer allows one to account for modest rents and royalties. It required an upgrade. Even though it was free, it seemed flawed. Somehow it double counted income by filing it in two different places. I doubt the issue was operator error. It took me two anxious and frustrating days to figure out how to rectify the problem. The help line was helpful until I needed follow up advice, I was told that required an additional $100.<br />Speaking of unnecessary expenses, the cost of a second state form is exorbitant, as is the cost of filing state returns online. It seems state taxation departments should give tax filers an incentive to file online because that makes their work so much easier. Next year, I'm going to shop around because I feel Turbo Tax screwed me this year and turned what has been a fun exercise into a nightmare.\n",

H&R does offer a return policy, but it's not worth my time for the amount I purchased it for.  I will be sticking with Turbo Tax for next years taxes as well.  Hopefully they don't pull any stupid stuff like the last time.\n",

The dialog appears with the name of the file off the top of the screen, so I can't put in a new name. If I just hit save to overwrite, the &#34;really overwrite?&#34; dialog appears somewhere off-screen as well, and I had to kill the program. Unfortunately, PSE13 has exactly the same problem.  Also, the crop tool now pops up its suggestions for crops, which covers up part of the image so I can't finish making the crop I intended to make until I cancel and collapse the parameter dialog. Also the Recompose tool seems completely unworkable if you care what size the end result will be. Printing controls are still as confusing as ever.

      "1\tI have been a Quicken (for Windows) user for nearly 20 years.  It has been a reasonably reliable and intuitive program to keep track of personal finances.  Then I moved to a Mac computer and bought Quicken for Mac 2015.  I have been using the Mac version of Quicken for about 6 months.  &#34;Using&#34; is probably a misnomer - this product is almost unusable.  The program is buggy, the input process is awkward and is nothing like the Windows based versions.  To top matters off, when doing my taxes this year, I discovered that unlike in the Windows version, it is impossible to export spending reports to Excel.  This added many, many hours to the process of getting materials together for the accountant.<br /><br />I don't know why Intuit would release a program that fails on every level.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a Mac based accounting program that does what Quicken is supposed to?  It is a shame that when a long term customer is looking for a Mac based product that works like &#34;Quicken for Windows&#34;, the furthest thing from that standard seems to be Quicken for Mac.\n",

      "1\tThis product had a bug in the code of how it calculated certain deductions. Even when I went into the &#34;Forms view&#34; instead of &#34;Easy Mode&#34; I could not fully fix it without product help. Getting product help involved emailing TurboTax to get a code to call them, and then sitting on hold for over an hour on 6 different occasions. That's right - I spent over 7 hours on the phone with them to get a simple calculation error fixed. On several of those on-hold occasions I was told I was being rung through to a supervisor only to be put in to a dead-end central voicemail. On two occasions I was given numbers to call back only to find that number called to a travel agent/cruise selling business. And I was told a supervisor would call me back, and of course she didn't. When I finally did get help I had product support and tax support on the line and all of them argued about what line to enter items onto on the form, and the proper math. Someone multiplied 200 x12 incorrectly and gave me a bad number to put into the form. Luckily I'm a math teacher and caught it! And when I asked how I could be sure, after all of the bungling and bad math and arguing, that I had gotten the right answer, or even that that &#34;bug&#34; in the code wouldn't continue to enter bad numbers they said I couldn't be sure and should buy audit support from them. So, to add it up, I bought the product (around $50), spent 7 hours on hold (about $700 if we're valuing my time), another hour listening to Turbo Tax staff argue and do bad math ($100), and then had to buy audit support (another $39). When Customer Service followed up with me they told me there was nothing they could do to compensate me. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - Save yourself the pain.\n",

Dragon allowed me to effectively go back to work.  I find it works well for composing letters and emails and any kind of writing where you are creating sentences and context.  The software loves context and figures out the words very well.  Its much less helpful filling out forms or listening to single words.<br /><br />I was able to get the hang of the navigation throughout my computer pretty well.  I also liked the commands structure much better than the Windows software.  Its smarter and I had far fewer errors.  The windows didn't learrn as quickly and frequently couldn't respond to commands.<br /><br />The software does learn and get smarter as you use it.  Can be a bit frustrating getting used to it but keep at it.  It will learn your voice pretty quickly and become more effective for you as you keep using it.<br /><br />It does require some processing power to run.  If you have an old computer, it will be quite slow and take up a lot of system resources.  When I put it on newer machines, it was able to keep up with my speech pace well and did not impact performance of my other programs.  I tried it on 3 computers:<br />2009 Lenovo laptop - ran really really slow - almost unusable.<br />2015 Lenovo Flex 2 laptop with 6 GB RAM - runs very well, keeps up with my pace of speech and very accurate.  I do turn it off when I am not using it as it does take up some system resources to run in background.<br />2012 ZT with AMD 2.9 GHz processor and 16 GB RAM - runs best on this machine.  Very fast and no need to turn it off as it does not slow down my machine.<br /><br />Make sure you disable the Windows SR if you install Dragon as you won't want them both running simultaneously.<br /><br />I used an old, cheap microphone and it worked fine.  No need to purchase an expensive one.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this software for anyone who can't type well or is experiencing pain typing.  I probably won't use it much now that I have recovered and can type faster than I can Dragon but its nice to have the option when my hand gets sore.

Users are no longer able to drag and drop reminders from the memorized transaction list to the calendar for future entry. You can only enter reminders by setting up the reminder from scratch. I typically enter many transactions as reminders (upcoming utility bills, tax bills, tuition bills, etc.). Quicken now has no memory of which bank account those bills will be paid from, any categorization or tagging of those bills, etc. You now have to remember and enter that information every time you create a reminder. This dramatically decreases the value of Quicken to me. People were apparently asking Intuit to fix this flaw back in version 2013 and there are numerous complaints about it on various Quicken forums, but apparently they have chosen not to do so.

Once the subscription expires, all the software stop running.<br />(2) Norton Identity Safe which stores your usernames and passwords for websites,also stop running once the subscription expires. Norton claims it is a free password manager on its website norton (com) BUT IT IS NOT.<br />(3) I am using Windows 8. The software is full of bugs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.<br /> Many items on the MENU of the software do not work or do not respond when I click on them. I think they are there just for looks.<br />(4) Tech support is BAD. I called at least 7 separate times, each time the instructions given do not get the software to work. At first you are talking to someone with an Indian accent from India. Then if he/she does not fix the problems, usually the case, you are transferred to non-Indian tech support. He/she told me to reinstall the software at least 4 times.<br />He/she told me to download a remote connection software so he/she could check inside my computer. After spending one hour inside my computer, he/she failed to fix the problems and just hung up.<br />(5) The Identity Safe works sometimes in Google Chrome. It does not work in Internet Explorer or Firefox. You can read about numerous posts on the internet about it not working.<br />(6) I am using Kaspersky Security which has less bugs and works in all 3 browsers, Chrome, IE and Firefox.\n",

      "1\tThis is one of the most unfriendly programs I have ever used.  It seems to be geared toward GPS applications.  Does anybody really plan a trip on a PC-based program?  I am in real estate, and I simply want to make maps where I can place a star where I need it and label it &#34;Comp 1&#34; or &#34;Subject Property.&#34;  This can be done on Street Atlas 2015, but it requires numerous keystrokes and several tool changes, and the results are still disappointing.  Suppose you want to find your house on a map, place a star there, and label it &#34;Home.&#34;  Step one is to go to the &#34;Find&#34; tab to locate the property by address.  It will show you dozens of hits.  Even though the first hit was a precise match, you still have to manually select it from the list of hits.  Now the program automatically inserts a &#34;Maptag&#34; at that address, which labels the property with the street address.  But you wanted it labeled &#34;Home,&#34; not with your street address.  Unfortunately, the Maptag cannot be edited, so you must delete it, which takes three more keystrokes.  Now that you know where the property is located on the map, you must switch to the &#34;Draw&#34; tab, where there are various tools for inserting different types of symbols onto the map.  There are very few symbols available, and editing them is ridiculously complex.  You can't just choose small, medium, large.  If you want the star to be larger, you have to create one from scratch, one pixel at a time, and you are still limited to a very small symbol.  Once you settle for a symbol and drag it to the map, a text box automatically pops up to add a label to the symbol.  That label is positioned to the upper right of the symbol, and the position cannot be adjusted.  So, if you also put a star on the adjacent house and labeled it &#34;Neighbor,&#34; the labels would overlap each other.  The label is also in a transparent box, so it may not be clearly visible if there is a colored map feature at that particular spot on the map that conflicts with the color of your text.  Since the edit features for the symbol label are so lame, you can just eliminate the label by hitting enter with no text.  But you still want a label for your home, so now you must change tools to add a &#34;MapNote.&#34;  At least the MapNote is a solid box and can be oriented to point from any direction, so maybe you can point at your home from the top left and at your neighbor's home from the bottom right.  All text in the MapNote must be on a single line, so don't plan on adding too long of a description.  The default position for the MapNote is again upper right of where you place it.  You can drag it to a different orientation, but you must switch to another tool to do this.  Similarly, if you want to edit the text in the MapNote, you need to switch tools again.  I hope you are getting the picture of how freaking difficult it is to simply put a star at your house and label it &#34;Home.&#34;  Nearly everything you might want to accomplish with a map program is possible with Street Atlas, but even the simplest of tasks becomes complex and time-consuming.  The Help functions do nothing to simplify the process and simply regurgitate the instructions that pop up when you hover over a symbol or task button.  Until recently, I used a version of DeLorme that was about 20 years old.  It was extremely easy to use, and I miss it dearly.  Unfortunately, many roads have been built since then, so the underlying maps became obsolete, but it was so much easier to do what I wanted to do.  I have tried several version of Street Atlas over the years, but each is less friendly than the last, so I kept reverting to the old standard for as long as possible.  My business partner would tease me because my printed maps showed a copyright date of 1996.  Now my maps have a current date, but I spending a couple hours per week on a task that used to consume just a few minutes per week.\n",

In addition to being ridiculously expensive (one license only works for a one-shot use), the user interface is clumsy and the support is almost as bad.  A failed install necessitates a call to Customer &#34;Service&#34; to get the software re-enabled.  So the buyer should beware all the Laplink hype: I had better luck using Microsoft's internal transfer software, and it was free!  It's really sad: I used to swear by Laplink's software and cable transfer system back in the early PC days, but for new systems you'll only swear *AT* what I'd have to term crapware IMHO..\n",

      "1\tI'm a longtime Quicken user with a huge data base built up over many years.  The program is critical to me.  Recently I was forced to upgrade from the 2007 program, which had worked very beautifully. For additional revenue reasons, Intuit has now decided to obsolete it's previous programs. It's so disturbing to discover that the &#34;upgrade&#34; 2015 edition is an unmitigated disaster.  My faith in Intuit has been badly shaken.  So many bugs and unanticipated inconveniences in the new program, it's difficult to know where to begin.  Soon after downloading, I found myself trying to find help from Intuit and ran into another sad reality.  Either Intuit has hired only a handful of support people; or, the volume of dissatisfied Quicken 2015 customers is so enormous they are unable to respond in an acceptable way.  I suspect the latter. The wait time is typically over an hour.  Wish I had a good suggestion for current Quicken customers.  If you are treated like me, you will be forced to buy their new product, like it or not, or be unable to use critical features of older versions -- like on-line communication with your bank accounts.  For potential new customers who are looking to start their experience with Quicken 2015, my advice is to stay away!\n",

The program can no longer connect to my banks, and an update is required.  But whenh I try and update, it does not work.  Junk, beware, I am looking for an alterntive.  Terrib;le support and tereible communication from the company.  Update of review below:  it's worse than ever. When doing my taxes I found that the accounts are downloading duplicate amounts in some cases, and not downloading deposits in other cases.  Added to that issue is the fact that the renaming rules somehow changed, and the wrong payee is now being inserted automatically.  It has cost be another 49 hours to straighten out.  I'm better off using Excel than this crap.  I have used Quicken for years.  This update for 2015 and patches 6 and 7 have made it impossible to open my data files.  On top of that, the Backups which I thought were occurring, were not for the past 20 days!  My password will not open my files.  I've called tech support and looked online and they are working on the issues, but there is no timeline.  The new program has mobile access, which means you can see your transactions, but it will not let you write a check from the mobile app?  They have created a mess for me, as I use Quicken for home and three businesses!  Be aware of these issues before you upgrade or buy. I'm a really unhappy user.\n",

In many cases, you can find a recipe on the Internet that may have been seen in a magazine or newspaper or whatever.  Being able to capture that recipe without having to type in all the information is a real time-saver.  Once in a while, I run across a recipe on the Internet where that particular format doesn't allow for easy capture by Cook'n.  When that happens, Cook'n's &#34;snippet&#34; tool works just fine, allowing me to capture that recipe in sections.  I have been systematically entering all the assorted recipes, notes & tips  from many sources into my library.  Some recipes come from the company product label, while  others come from miscellaneous booklets that my wife has collected over the years.  The nice part of that is being able to name a &#34;cookbook&#34; anything that you want it to be.  Having such a vast amount of information readily available and safe in the Cloud as a backup is a blessing, not to mention helping to eliminate a lot of clutter and disorganization.<br />Finally, I want to compliment DVO Support.  Each time I communicated with them, they did respond in a timely manner with answers or information that I could use and understand quite readily.  I understand some customers may have issues for whatever reason, I do not.  I think they are a great company and they have a wonderful product.\n",

      "5\tAlthough this &#34;software purchase&#34; seems a little sketch, I can confirm that it works.  I used the mac download, which worked great.  However, the amazon installer made everything more complicated than it needed to be.  You can hold off on the installer, and just go the the email saying your purchase was successful.  Under order details you will find a 16 digit redemption code.  Copy that into the private internet access website spot for a PIA Gift Card before even making an account (currently found under the &#34;Join Now&#34; tab, underneath the payment plans).  You will see a message that you now have 366 days, and will then be prompted for an email where they send your username and password to sign in to the actual program. From there, you can install the program from PIA's website (which I did), or use the amazon installer.<br /><br />Now to review what I have experienced with PIA's service.  I have not encountered any slow connections, but did have a few issues when getting things sorted out originally.  First of all, on my macbook pro, it would say it was connected, but my ip would not change.  I found the fix online here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/946/tip-mac-osx-pia-client-solving-connection-issues-with-udp<br />Basically, you just have to allow it past your firewall.  It was a simple fix, but I really wish they made it clear you needed to do this.<br /><br />The next issue I had was when I would disconnect from the VPN, I couldn't access the internet even though everything still said I was connected.  I found that the fix to this was unchecking VPN Kill Switch and IPv6 Leak Protection in the advanced settings.  It may only be one of those, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />All in all, there was some troubleshooting required to get things working, but I guess you aren't getting a VPN if you aren't capable enough to google a few minor issues.  The service has been great, and there is a huge range of servers/countries to connectto.  I can confirm that it works to bypass regional restrictions on streaming sites and such.  I included a screenshot of the current list of available servers, any of which you can choose.\n",

      "4\tI'm a former Quicken for Windows user for a very long  time, and have been pleased with how efficient Quicken software has been overall. There will always be quirks and bugs with any software, but the benefits for me outweigh any disadvantages.  I upgraded to Quicken for Mac 2015 and find it so much better than the former Mac software, Quicken Essentials.\n",

      "1\tI am so very sorry that I bought this online and don't have the option of returning it.  I had been using Quicken 2006 for all these years, but since my Macbook Pro doesn't support that version, I have been running Quicken on an older Macbook.  In the interest of having everything on one computer, I upgraded.  In addition to the fact that there is no manual, this program is anything but intuitive.  I was so daunted by it, that I haven't opened it since the first day when I loaded it up with all my financial info and then had no idea what to do next.  I continue to use the 2006 version on a separate computer and will only consider trying to work with the new version if my old Macbook dies.\n",

      "1\tAfter many years using Quicken and being forced to do this update, I can tell you its full of bugs.<br /><br />I even had to pay a second time just to try a new download. Now I have the most expensive software on my computer and it still does not work 100%.<br /><br />Im looking for another program to use.<br /><br />If you have a Mac don't go near this.\n",

      "5\t100% Satisfied!  Does exactly what they say. Happy Customer\n",
      "5\texcellent product so far. Put on wife's smart phone and tablet and 3 laptops with Norton internet security.  Was impressed with the ease of install and the fact that I was able to keep my local identity safes and didn't have to go cloud.  I have purchased the license and will use at end of this trial. Only one problem so far a notification to defrag my hard drive, since I run solid state drives I will have to look in to turning off this option.\n",

      "2\tI can somewhat understand Intuit's business model of selling relatively cheap software, and forcing you to upgrade every three years as essentially a way of charging for software maintenance.  I use Quicken in a fairly basic way, so there are no new features I need, so it does feel pretty heavy-handed.<br /><br />What is extremely frustrating is that I went from a perfectly stable and working copy of Quicken Home and Business 2012 to a Quicken Home and Business 2015 where I now cannot download my Discover transactions.  After I have typed the password into the One Step Update password box, it says &#34;To continue, enter the password for the following institutions&#34;.  Yes, I've tried searching the online Quicken Help, which basically seems to be variations of re-installing the software.\n",
      "1\tThe program created a boot disk for the computer to reset it's password, but when I put it into the computer it said oops, no operating system found and then it suggested that I buy its upgraded version for 40 dollars more because it's more compatible.  No way to contact seller or to get a refund that I can see.  I was straight robbed....\n",

      "1\tI downloaded Office 13 from Amazon and it did not work properly. After a couple more attempts I contacted Microsoft and spend 2 hours and  a repair fee to get the program working.. The Microsoft Tech told me this was a corrupted file and the program had also corrupted other files in my computer. I asked Amazon for a refund. and was refused because it was not their problem. I am concerned on two levels. On one level Amazon did not see this as a problem. The other is if this had been a defective product that I could sent back, I would have received a credit without any question.. as I have in the past. Customers of Amazon need to be aware!\n",

      "4\tI've been using Office since Office 97.  Went through upgrades at work and home with pro versions of Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and now 2013.  I'm using 2010 and 2013 side by side and I was a little disappointed with the 'flat and webbie' looking interface of 2013, but after using it for awhile (heavily with Outlook, Excel and Access) it's grown on me.  It was probably more of a shock coming from the 2010 interface more than anything else.  The one thing that disappoints me is Outlook when your email gets moved to the cloud.  It is slow, slow, slow, slow, slow to update.  It was much faster with 2010 to the servers.  The 2013 interface is pretty snappy though when it's not having to wait for a 'delivery from the cloud'.  Really though the only time you'll have to worry about that is if your place of business decides to move your exchange service off site.  For home users you may have issues with moving your contacts to Outlook 2013 and will be disappointed that you can't import any emails from archived .pst files (if there is a way to do this without registry hacks I'm all ears).  OneNote adds it's own snipping tool that I feel is integrated with it better than using the Windows snipping tool.   It allows you to send your snips to any page in your notebook without having to go to manually go to the page in your notebook to paste it.    The other thing that disappoints me is that the Home and BUSINESS version (Apologies.  I'm not yelling.  I'd have used italics if it were an option here.) doesn't come with Access.  It would be nice if it were included and not an add on.  I haven't found too many things that would make me say 'I've got to have it', but the suite is nice, so if you don't own a copy of Office, or would like to upgrade from and earlier version, you wouldn't go wrong.  As far as install problems go, I've never had one with any of the Office products, Visio Pro or Project Pro.  I've also installed copies of Office Home and Student on many friends computers (yes each was licensed), and didn't have problem installing those either.  In fact, the only Microsoft product I've had a problem with was Windows 7, but a quick call to Microsoft solved the issue.\n",
      "5\tAfter reading the comments, I purchased Sweet Home 3D and love it. For the cost and what I wanted, the product is perfect, for me. Per a reviewer suggestions, I read all the tutorials, First, I drew our home, then drew a remodeled plan and printed both for my wife. She was impressed with the layout, easy to understand symbols and detail. I referred to the Preferences and Tutorials often. We used the Virtual feature to walk thru our home, before and after. I suggest, anyone with experience with PowerPoint, Harvard Graphics or Mac Quick Draw could use this product. I AM a technophobe, so my wife was concerned about this purchase. About 3.5 hours later and we were enjoying sitting together &#34;walking thru our home&#34;. I did not expect a $500.00 (to the door knob detail) result but a plan clear enough for my contractor to see and understand what changes we wanted and what they should look like.\n",

      "5\tNorton always takes care of my computer.  I have used it for years and had absolutely no problems!  When I had Norton 360 it backed up all my files for me and SAVED me when my computer crashed.  I only lost 2 minor files bcz they were created after the last backup.  I LOVE Norton!\n",
      "3\tNot completely satisfied. Updates are not forthcoming.  Having a hard time opening Word.  It keeps closing as soon as it opens. Not happy.\n",
      "2\tOffice for Mac 2011 Home & Business is a disaster and a rip-off for anyone who expects a product for Mac that behaves in any way like Office for Windows, especially the Outlook component.  Nowhere does Microsoft warn – BEFORE you buy – that Outlook for Mac does not, will not, cannot sync with Apple Mail, Calendar, or Contacts. Not through iCloud, and not even through iTunes or iSync, despite the fact that “Sync Services” on Outlook’s tool bar says it will. Call Microsoft for help on this and you will be told that they don’t support syncing for Mac, and have no plans to address this issue.  Their “fix”?  Subscribe to Office 365 – although they decline to say whether that will sync with calendars and contacts. (I am disinclined to pay Microsoft in perpetuity to access my own digital property.) Having problems with email? Just have Microsoft Exchange accounts and you’ll be fine.<br /><br />A bit of background, I am a longtime Office user under Windows – since Office 97, so nearly 20 years.  I also remember that Word and Excel were originally for Mac ONLY, and those of us working in MS-DOS and early Windows versions were limited to WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3.  Not long after the Windows version of Office was released, it quickly became the standard, and the addition of Outlook to manage contacts and email vastly increased the usefulness of the entire suite.  Sadly, it seems that Microsoft’s Office team has forgotten and abandoned its Mac roots.<br /><br />Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are passably good enough, but still not equal to the Windows version. If you really need Word and Excel, and many of us do, especially if you have existing Word docs and Excel sheets that just don’t quite translate to other programs – believe me, I’ve tried: OpenOffice, Pages and Numbers, and even Google Docs, and they just don’t cut it – buy the Home & Student edition without Outlook and save yourself a few bucks.<br /><br />In my opinion, Microsoft is committing a near fraud on today’s Mac users and should pay a price for their arrogance.  That won’t happen, but I am hopeful that this information will prevent at least a few people plunking down good money for something that isn’t fully functional and that Microsoft doesn’t plan to fix.\n",

Their deceptive practice in 2014 of reducing the features offered in the Deluxe version, and trying to get another 40 bucks from people is wrong!  They did offer a free upgrade, but Intuit's real intent of greed has lost me as a customer.\n",

      "4\tSwitched between H&R Block and TurboTax, but will stick with H&R Block due to TurboTax's hoax this year, as they separate schedules with tax filing and you have to pay additional for those schedules.  It is the educational background, people! I believe people gave very bad feedback because they may not understand tax laws, as a prerequisite, to use the software. This is not a toy for everybody, and even some toys have age restrictions.   Turbotax, what a shame! Clever cheater!\n",

No payroll either.  I also buy and hold and ignore the markets.  I set bill pay up with my five bank accounts and don't really need to pay from within Quicken.  One bank still can't directly download transactions .<br /><br />Quicken 2015 for Mac is very similar to Essentials but much improved.  Categories are easier to find in the registers.  Finally transfers are handled.  I always had to delete on transfer. now the software asks if there is an other side.  It's a good start and very useable.\n",
      "1\tI tried to install the product but kept coming up with error codes.<br /><br />Contacted tech support and they gave me a possible work around but strangely he signed off before I could install the product.<br /><br />The fix did not work and I've sent them 3 emails, 2 of them replying to theirs wanting me to let them know if I got it working (derp) but they have not responded.<br /><br />All in all, Kaspersky's tech support sucks, if I can say that word getting around some filter.<br /><br />If not, then they $%^$$^@#$%^!@#$%@$&@$%^#$, in cartoon speak.\n",

Once I was satisfied that it would work for that application, I realized that I could use this application for all my wireless devices that I travel with! Instead of having to authenticate 7 devices to the hotel's WiFi network, I could just have my personal Windows laptop authenticate, start up my Connectify Hotspot PRO 2015, and then all my other devices (6 to be exact) would just work! They all knew the Connectify's SSID so they just started working! It's AWESOME! I highly recommend this application to travelers, especially business travelers, like me!<br /><br />Like I said, I set up my person laptop (running Windows 7 Home Premium),<br /><br />1. then my work laptop (Windows 7 Enterprise),<br />2. my work iPad,<br />3. my personal tablet (Motorola Xoom),<br />4. my Amazon FireTV Stick,<br />5. myAmazon Kindle Fire,<br />6. and my cellphone (Motorola Droid Maxx)<br /><br />just connect automatically to the Connectify Hotspot 2015 PRO SSID.!!!<br /><br />It's Easy!

This is a totally NEW and improved version of the software and will seem totally different from the 2007 Version I used daily. BUT if one is patient and goes slowly to learn the software a novice like me will sing the praises. There are U tube videos that are great to educate a visual learner like myself. I have at least 10-15 accounts and unlike other versions the data downloads are easy. For accounts that do not allow direct upload from Quicken the data can easily be imported.<br />I am still learning but in the end 90% of my data will automactically upload and I will save hours of manually loading  into Quicken.<br />Take the plunge, be patient and you will get there.<br />Would of been perfect if videos were included with the sofeware but easy to find on U tube.\n",

The software is full of bugs.Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.<br />(4) Tech support is BAD. I called at least 7 separate times, each time the instructions given do not get the software to work. At first you are talking to someone with an Indian accent from India. Then if he/she does not fix the problems, usually the case, you are transferred to non-Indian tech support.<br />He/she told me to download a remote connection software so he/she could check inside my computer. After spending one hour inside my computer, he/she failed to fix the problems and just hung up.<br />(5) Many items on the MENU of the software do not work or do not respond when I click on them. I think they are just for looks.<br />(6) The Identity Safe works sometimes in Google Chrome. It does not work in Internet Explorer or Firefox.

It randomly generates errors causing the software to shut down. It's not compatible with several major financial institutions. Periodically, when I update transactions from my bank accounts, it retroactively changes transactions I had already reconciled from years back and I spend hours and hours correcting all the issues the downloads cause.  I have so many issues with downloading transactions, I essentially track everything manually now which is no more efficient than using a spreadsheet.  I hate your product Intuit. Save yourself the frustration and find another program before you have years of Quicken data that make it difficult to migrate to another application.\n",

This stinks but it's livable - only if you catch the error message. If you restart your machine, the Amazon client will naturally quit, and you will never see the error message.<br /><br />Imagine copying thousands of pictures, and Amazon missed about 20. Now try to find which 20 without an error message. This is obviously autobiographical.<br /><br />There is no option to restart an upload if there's an interruption. Let's say you're using a laptop and need move outside your network. Nope, cancel your download and note where it stopped. That way you know where it left off.<br /><br />Amazon, you're taking this minimum viable product thing a little too far. If you didn't have such a loyal user base, this thing would be kindle on the fire. You can do better than that.\n",

I have had this for quite a while and after the first year I transitioned to using a self made spreadsheet. I would recommend a free Excel download from Microsoft and then customize to your preferences.They are free and do the basics one needs.Unless you absolutely must have the downloads from your bank accounts use another finance program or use a spreadsheet.

The Mac version will only allow you to enter the employees contact information and nothing else unless you have the payroll subscription.

More common is having to go to activity monitor and force close it.<br /><br />So on certain youtube videos it works fairly well.

      "2\tWorks much better on a Mac than Windows because you can actually move stuff into directories that sync like Dropbox. But it's a complete fail on Windows. The desktop app is pointless. It allows you to drag and drop files, but you don't get to tell them where to go, nor do you have access to your files and folders on the cloud without proceeding to the web, where you then have to manually select and browse to where you want to move and download your files. There isn't even a way to use desktop syncing software because there is no &#34;amazon cloud&#34; drive to sync to on the Windows desktop. It's ridiculous and this is leaving Amazon almost completely out of the cloud competition. All the free space in the world doesn't make up for the pathetic interface. What's so frustrating is that it seems the infrastructure is there, it's just not giving you full access that causes the hang up. Same with their cloud music player. I love having access to all of my music, but the lack of features in the player and complicated functionality (how in the world do you remove something from the library?!) is just intolerable. I can't imagine that the photo library is going to improve much either. Amazon really needs to get their stuff together, because they are completely missing the boat on this one.   *****UPDATE******  Ok, so the reason I was getting the directories on my Mac was because that was an old install. So this is to confirm that the available app for Mac works the same as Windows.  HOWEVER, after a loooooooot of digging and researching and trial and error, I think I'm starting to realize why the change was made. I gather that the idea is to be able to collect all your data from various sources and allow you to access from anywhere (like every cloud does); BUT, it is actually preventing you from syncing all of your machines or devices with it because you could potentially be putting an incredible excess of data on every system. This is actually a valid reason for not wanting to use a lot of cloud services. It's also not a very good system, and sometimes not even possible, to move your data to a specific local cloud directory to get it to sync. So while I think Amazon caught onto this in time for the big &#34;unlimited data&#34; push, they haven't offered very good alternatives. So far, the only thing I've found to work is Allway Sync, which takes advantage of the Amazon Cloud Drive API that is now available to allow you to setup syncing. I'm trying it out now, and it seems to be working ok, but this only runs on Windows; I'm really needing something to work like this on Mac. I think it will soon be more accessible, but for now it's amazing how little information there is to try and access this cloud drive! The other issue, is well...what happens next. So you sync or backup all your data, and then you move to another machine where you need to access it. Again, that Amazon desktop app is almost useless. The only thing it's really good for is being able to toss stuff up to the drive, like in an emergency, in a completely unorganized fashion. You hope it all gets there because there's no cancelling or pausing, and you'll just have to remember to go online at some point and move it to where it actually belongs. If you want to retrieve any of your data, you basically have to go online, browse, select your files or folders, choose download, which then saves your files as an archive to your downloads folder, which you then have to extract and move to where it belongs. It's painful. Again, you could use Allway Sync (or hopefully something else that works as well) to simply do all this for you, but shame on Amazon for not making this process just a tiny bit more simple for its users. Would it really even be so much to ask to retain the dropbox type folder sync structure, and just have the option to flag how things get synced and unsynced? (yes, I want to always sync from here, no I do not want to ever download this directory to this machine).I wonder if Amazon just assumes that too many people will upload several terabytes of data which would then get unknowingly pushed around between too many devices, and wreak havoc on every server. Because the unlimited plans are so affordable, maybe that's why if you really want to use them, you have to do enough research to actually figure out HOW to properly use them! There just has to be a better way! I think Amazon was in a rush to try and beat out the cloud competition, without flushing out a good consumer-friendly plan. I personally do still have some faith that this could end up being a great solution for me, but it has to get better.\n",
      "3\t\"I have worked with Quicken for windows for 20+ years and loved it. I changed to the MAC version and have two complaints regarding the 2015 version.

You see, I was under the impression that everything would remain with a clean, new user interface. The &#34;new&#34; interface looks exactly like the old interface. For some other unknown reason, it won't let me update my Password Vault, either. I get the screen, but the software won't allow me to add anything. The fact is, I was using 2012 and was happy with it UNTIL they shut-off my ability to communicate with my banks. This was not explained to me in the 2012 purchase, so I felt &#34;held-up at cash-point&#34; to buy the new version OR ELSE. So far, all this new version has done is keep me cut-off from my bank and &#34;read&#34; my Quicken backup files. Such a deal. I already had that. I'm still out $50 and haven't improved anything. I was robbed! At this point, I want a refund. Problem is, the new installation UNINSTALLS the older version before the upgrade.

I was surprised to find they have my current and updated credit card info, which I have not given them recently.<br />In this version of Quicken, you cannot use it until you go through all their identification steps.\n",
      "5\tI upgraded from Quicken Deluxe 2014, and it really wasn't worth it.  I should have waited until 2016 came up.  Absolutely no benefit to me, except I bought a new PC and thought I'd keep everything as fresh as possible.  I have been using Quicken since 1990 (it was the DOS version in those days) and generally upgrade every 2 years.  I'll stick to that going forward.  In my opinion Quicken is still the best financial management package out there.  I love the software, just not worth upgrading annually!\n",
      "5\tAs always I find TurboTax easy to use and easy to go through and review categories of things.  Importantly it is RELIABLE - meaning i have never had a program bug in any of the last 6 or so years of using it.  This year for the first time I downloaded it rather than getting CD because I was in time crunch.  I don't like how you have to pay to file state taxes but that may not be their fault, not sure.  I usually electronically file federal since it is free and then print and mail state taxes, but this year was in too much of a time crunch so was at least glad and relieved to file state electronically, even if it did cost extra.\n",

      "5\tI have been using Quick Books for about 20 years and never worried about updating or getting the  newest  version.  But  this time when I bought a new computer I was not going to install something from the last century (or millennium).  Unfortunately when I started researching  about Quicken software I found out that you can not (at least not easily) move files  from Quick Books to Quicken.  I was uneasy about buying Quicken because of this issue.  On the other hand I only needed software for my personal use so at the end I took a chance with Quicken.  I figured that it would take me at least couple of weeks to manually enter the important accounts from my old computer.  When I received my software I was curious about it  and decided to install it right after  I got home from work.  About 2 hours later I was done with all I needed (accounts, bills,  etc.) .  After that,  it's been amazing.  Accounts automatically updated, entries magically cleared and list goes on and on.  I don't want to waste your  time reading what this software will do for you  so I won't .  All I can say is that  this software is an enormous TIME SAVER and I wish that I bought it SOONER.\n",

      "1\tIf you cannot sync your files, it is not a backup solution at all. I hunted around online and found a working version of the old sync client, but it has so many bugs that it is practically useless. I dug around in my filesystem and found its log files, and it gets continually stuck trying to sync the same 3KB file, and failing for days on end (I have my own home server).<br /><br />It doesn't matter how much cloud storage you have if you can't use it effectively. On the new app, you can't even download single files at all, you have to download your entire cloud drive to get just one file. My drive is 51GB, who in the world has the time for that?<br /><br />To make matters worse, you can't download whole folders online either. Most photo folders easily exceed 5GB, and if yours does you have to manually select up to 1000 files at a time and download the folder in pieces, which usually ends up costing amazon more in bandwidth whern I accidentally download the same file 4 or 5 times.<br /><br />But it gets even worse: The android sync client also fails to reliably sync photos, too. Its most highly touted feature (automatic photo and video upload) totally doesn't work. It will seemingly arbitrarily skip 10 out of 100 files, and never sync them. What is supposed to make the job easier makes it harder, as I ended up just syncing my phone to my PC using filezilla and and Android FTP server. Not only was it faster, it doesn't skip files for no discernable reason.<br /><br />As a software developer, I don't have the time to find elaborate workarounds to make a fundamentally broken system usable every single day. Until this has a working, proper sync client for Windows, my data will be with Google.\n",

I did not recall having such difficulty with the Turbo Tax last year (this was not new to this year), so my conclusion is that Turbo Tax did a much better job of hand holding through that area. I did the taxes a couple days before the 15th, & had to wait 2 1/2 hours on the phone until a representative could walk me through that area. After 45 minutes, we were done. Ultimately, they got me through it, but it wasn't easy. Next year, I will pay the extra $ & go back to Turbo Tax.\n",

      "2\tAfter reading all of the negative reviews, it was a painful decision to buy this. Like others here, I can no longer download transactions using my 2012 version and know myself enough to realize that I will never go through the hassle of manually downloading them from each of my financial institutions. So I bought the CD version thinking that maybe installation would go more smoothly than the download, and at the very least, it would be easier to return under Quicken's 60-day money back guarantee.<br /><br />Installation onto my computer went okay, but getting my accounts up and running took a lot of patience. Here's why:<br />(1) You're forced to sign up/ sign-in to your Intuit.com account, and then separately into a Quicken.com account. This seems to be related to the mobile app as well as tracking investments... Of course I haven't signed into either of those websites in years, so I had to initiate password resets with both.<br />(2) Once the software was up and running, none of my accounts were able to successfully download new transactions (the whole point of upgrading to this software). At first I tried re-entering my passwords for each account. No go. Then I tried &#34;resetting&#34; the online services (when you're in a particular account register, click on the setting (gear) icon in the upper right, and hit &#34;Edit Account Details.&#34; The reset button is under the Online Services tab). This sort of worked -- but it also caused the software to hang each and every time I did it. I probably used Ctrl+Alt+Del five times to force the program closed. Finally, I resorted to &#34;deactivating&#34; each online service and setting them up from scratch. That worked without causing the program to hang.<br /><br />With those steps out of the way, the software is mostly operating how I expect it to, but it's still buggy. For example, I have several old investment accounts that have been closed for years. I had marked them as closed in the previous version of Quicken and had them hidden from view. Now several of them have re-appeared in the Accounts Panel under the heading &#34;Separate.&#34; These accounts are not added to my net worth, but still it's really annoying to see a balance there when I had zeroed them out a long time ago. The kicker is, if I click buttons to &#34;Close account,&#34; it just opens a window with instructions on how to close the account. In other words, the software programmers forgot to actually program that function in!<br /><br />So long story short, if you've been using Quicken for years, it is possible to use this software and retain some of the functionality that you had in previous versions. Be prepared for a good dose of frustration though.\n",

      "5\tAs a long-time fan of Cyberlink products, specifically PowerDirector for video editing, and Power2Go for disc burning, I finally took the plunge and downloaded a copy of their media playing juggernaut, PowerDVD. I went with the Ultra version to get all the features offered.<br />I am coming from OEM version 10, now at version 15, PowerDVD is an extremely popular program and I'm sorry to have waited so long to revisit it because 15 is stellar.<br />First off, the download was swift and without error, as was the install, just run the executable file, add the key code when asked, and now I'm astonished to see what I have been missing all these years.<br />The nicely designed UI was easy to read using it's stock skin, yet bursting with choices. Assuming you are online, Cyberlink's PowerDVD15 offers up links, via it's Media Library, to the latest Movie Info, including currently in theaters, upcoming, DVD/Blu-ray releases, top-rated, most-collected, TV shows, even Celebrity links, all by using tiled images making for a very lively but easy-to-browse experience. The visuals really stand out here and make you want to keep clicking around to see what's next!<br />All the time I am poking about the inviting interface, the program is scanning my drives for any and all media to add to the Library, because this juggernaut is also a photo viewer, music player, multi (and I do mean multi) format video player so all my entertainment choices are in one place. As a semi-professional video editor, I have several drives of video and audio from a myriad of sources, and I can't find anything that PowerDVD15 can't play. The list of features and functions is almost endless, custom skins (your own images), TrueTheater (Cyberlink's amazing audio-video enhancement technology), links to feeds from Vimeo, as well as to my Youtube and MoovieLive accounts, all executed beautifully using the tiles, but you can customize that, too, by resizing, displaying them as lists, and for some categories, calendar-style displays. And I haven't even played a DVD or Blu-ray yet!<br />Getting finally to it's seemingly most heralded feature, disc play, I was thrilled to find it was easily the best disc player I ever used. There is a trainload of items you can tweak related to performance of audio and video that I cannot properly detail here, you just need to take this program for a test-drive to see for yourself that Cyberlink PowerDVD has become an entertainment superstar. Photo slide shows, music playlists, 3D, DLNA, Dolby, remote control via Wifi using your smart phone, a companion tablet app (Power Media Player) available for Apple and Android, as well as my favorite, Windows.<br />From within PowerDVD15 you can share to Flickr and Facebook, email, print, and it even has links to edit apps, such as Paint, and Cyberlink PhotoDirector. There are also easy uploads to your own Cyberlink Cloud account to keep everything backed up and synced with your other devices.<br />PowerDVD15 has truly added to my entertainment options in so many ways, it’s simply put, an embarrassment of riches, all brought together in one place in a seamless, fun to use program.

Trying to navigate to their website is futile, as their website is poorly designed, non-responsive, and doesn't give a clear indication of what data they hold.<br />Let me be clear - I don't want Intuit holding any of my financial data in the cloud, ever.\n",
      "5\tThis is a powerful easy and fun to use software. The only thing I think could be easier is if it saved the titles automatically. I didn't see a setting for that. You also have to be careful using downloaded titles and pixels, sometimes they cause your title to disappear but that is probably a setting. Anyways I was frusterated and quit using video software years ago. Now this brings back the fun. Good stuff!\n",

Unfortunately, Quicken is one of the few products available with comprehensive features to manage multiple types of financial accounts, and migrating Quicken data to another product is risky.\n",

      "4\tI have been using Quicken since it first came out on Personal Computers. This latest version for Mac is very nice and good; the mobile app works well and over all I am very satisfied with the product.  That being said let me first mention some hazards I experienced along the way before reviewing Quicken with a great rating.<br />I had changed the way I logged into my bank and began using a two step login which prevented Quicken Essentials from working 99% of the time. I became frustrated and purchased the Apple Mac 2015 for my laptop. It worked for a short time but was a real hassle and I did web connect to download my accounts. The mobile part never worked.  I became frustrated. I went back to my Quicken Essentials and to my delight it began working pretty well and even with my two step login at my bank. Then at the end of April I was notified that Essentials was going away and I would have to purchase Quicken for Mac 2015. So I purchased it. Now I have 2 Quickens: one for my iMac and one for my Apple laptop.<br />So....still they didn't work. I stopped using the two step process and Quicken on both computers worked fine. But still the mobile app wasn't working. I contacted Quicken but they said it had to do with my bank so I said ok I'll call them. Then I got to thinking....My iMac is where my iTunes account is which holds the Mobile app I downloaded to my iPad. So...I went and opened my iMac Quicken Mobile App and synced from there instead of the way I was using my laptop where I don't use iTunes.  Well guess what....The Mobile works GREAT. So we must use the mobile app from a computer than we downloaded the app from and Quicken and our banks don't like the additional security measures for us to download properly.  I feel confident my information is secure and am still being asked more questions to ensure I am the one using the product.<br /><br />So I do recommend Quicken because when it works! I've not found any software I enjoy using more.\n",

      "1\tI have been a Quicken user for over 10 years and have always upgraded and used he newest releases.  Since the release of 2015 and it's 7 revision updates Intuit has become completely irresponsible in providing a quality product and supporting that product.  Revision 6 was released and there was noticeable problems with the operation of the software.  This was compounded with the most received release of Revision 7 in which the software continuously corrupted data file (including the backup files) particularly the password used to secure it.  All support by Intuit for Quicken is very slim unless you want to  pay for each service.  The only other support option is the user's forum where other user's and developers normally solve he solution.  With this Revision 7 I was forced to remove and reinstall and manually update to Revision 5 which is the most current release that doesn't provide any major problems.  Lucky, I had older backups that were not corrupted which only required a couple of hours to update.  Now I refuse to update my software and will look for a more reputable product with a higher quality of development and support.\n",

      "4\tI purchased Office 2013 via Office 365, so the big upfront cost was not a consideration. Office 365 is not software; it's a way of financing the use of this software. (See my review on Office 365, 4 stars, so far.) I had been buying Office using Office Home and Student as a base and purchasing Outlook and Publisher separately. This review is based on my personal and semi-professional use of Office itself, all applications except Access.  The install/upgrade went seamlessly. I upgraded from 2007, and find the new look and features improved and useful, perhaps because I skipped Office 2010. I agree with others that more appearance styles should be available. The 3 options don't tone it down quite enough for me, too much pure white and the contrast between active and inactive functions is not obvious enough. A light gray background would help. Although I do like the much crisper look of the application screens in general more 'theme' choices would be better. Navigation is somewhat different, but so far not hard to learn or more difficult to use, reasonably logical and intuitive.  I like that the splash screens show progress on loading, especially the loading of add-ins. Outlook loads slowly for me as I keep a lot of e-mails active in the current personal file, tens of thousands, and I was able to deactivate a number of Microsoft add-ins that I will never use to speed that up. The silliest thing is taking up space on the Outlook display for pictures of correspondents, and there doesn't seem to be any way to remove that, which really should be possible. What a waste of screen space. Very touchy-feely social networking stuff, but who really wants or needs all those blank photo places staring out at you?  I have used customized toolbars since they became available and the ability to move the Quick Access Toolbar right down to above the workspace is very convenient. I have customized them in each application with the 20 to 30 or so functions that I use most often and rarelyhave to go to the ribbon and sort through the tabs, which is cumbersome, well worth the few minutes of set up. If I find myself using a new function regularly I add it there.  Generally, the applications seem to load and run faster, although I wish that they all could use more of my 15GB of RAM to run even better. Unlike some others I don't find he availability of One Drive especially intrusive. Yes, it's there as the first choice when you save a new file, but if you don't want to use it you just ignore it. I'm not likely to want the bulk of my important and personal data out on a cloud somewhere, but could it see it perhaps  someday as a place for my sizeable music files if I needed to free up space on an internal drive, or maybe for photos or videos for people that have such things.  On the whole a good value especially the way that I bought it. Only 4 stars because I don't have much experience with it yet.\n",

Of course I got a rep that couldn't speak clear English. I allowed her to have access to my wife's laptop since her subscription ended first.

The Installer asked if I wanted to do the Mobile app and then sync. I optioned yes. Things went downhill from there. The Mobile version seemed to work but balances looked a little whacky. Without going into more detail, one of the Mobile Sync processes after trying to fix balances caused a Windows failure. Went back to reopen Quicken and my data file password either had been wiped out or deleted. Hooray for having made timely backups. Either way, I worked online chat for a couple of hours with a person who made a stellar try at fixing things. IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING CHAT WITH INTUIT, I NEEDED TO UNINSTALL AND RE-INSTALL THE NEW APP. REMEMBER TO GET YOUR AMAZON &#34;TOKEN&#34; FOR SOFTWARE DOWNLOADS....I DIDN'T, HAD TO GET A FREEBEE FROM INTUIT. Now I am operating on a non-Mobile linked 2015.  UPDATE: The Windows failure wiping out my password was a repeatable error that occurred every time I tried to sync with the mobile app using restored data from my different backups. WATCH OUT....\n",

I have been using this product ever since. I like to do it and make sure everything I can deduct is there. When my wife and I were first married we had our taxes done by her accountant and he did not list the deductions given to him for my cars. Well 400 dollars later and not done correctly we lost money. The hard part is staring to use it. You will need to have all your deductions and tax documents in place to start. You would need to provide these to your accountant the first time and every year after that as well so it is the same amount of work on your part. The nice part is once you completed one years return the information is returned for the next year and it makes things much easier.

      "2\tI've been a user of  Qucken for 20 years, but this is the worst version I've ever had.  I went from 2012 to 2015 and it's been terrible.  My biggest gripe is that the shortcuts don't work.  I've researched online and everyone has this problem and  there is no fix.  So after using Quicken for 20 years, and being used to hit &#34;CTRL-D&#34; to delete a transaction (which is standard in any program), it doesn't work.  Extremely annoying. The register tabs are also off visually  and I constantly have to reset them to see the entire line of data.  Finally, probably the biggest problem to me, you can only see your running balance if you have your transactions in date order.  I do,  f course, except that I like the unreconciled transactions (uncashed checks, transfers that haven't gone through, unpaid bills) to show up at the bottom of the register so I can quickly see if something  didn't go through or if the amount was different  then expected.  I have always done this, but now you will not see you running balance if you sort this way, so the unreconciled transactions get lost wherever they fall in date order.  This version is the worst one I have ever used and I don't understand why it is WORSE  then the one I had three years ago.  It should keep improving!\n",

However this year my primary computer contracted a virus and then wouldn't clear it out so I had to reformat the HDD and reinstall everything.  When I went to install Bit Defender I received a message that this license key has already been used.  I looked at the other computer in our house that was setup at the same time and realized I only 3 months left on my bit defender anyway I decided to purchase a new anti-virus.<br /><br />As i began looking and reading reviews AVG had a good product and in some cases better than Bit Defender for security but lacked some of the system maintenance tools.  This program not only has a great anti-virus and is extremely easy to use it also allows as many installs as I want and covers my mobile devices too.  Currently I have it installed on 5 computers 2 tablets and 2 cell phones, I just bought a new computer and will be installing it on that one next week.  I also really like that from any device I use I can see the status of my other devices and if they are current and protected.<br /><br />IN MY OPINION this would be great for anyone with a multi device household or a small or family business I can't brag enough about the level of protection, the ease of installation and maintenance or the amount of devices and types it covers.<br /><br />Thanks AVG and Amazon for this terrific product and value\n",

Quicken 2015 for Mac alleviated the disappointment that the previous version caused by addressing these small issues among others and fixing them.

      "4\tRepeating what many others have said (and those reviews were why I bought this product), I used to use TurboTax, mostly out of habit and convenience. TurboTax changed their pricing to be more expensive and changed their product model to make me have to do more work to figure out which product I needed to use. They broke me out of my habit by forcing me to do my research, and I thank them for that, because it brought me to H&R, which is just as easy and maybe even more clear than TT, plus significantly cheaper. H&R is my new habit, until they screw it up....  Loading in my 2013 TT return was easy and seamless. H&R's upgrade process and State download process could have been easier -- both required restarts of the application (automatic, though). Also, it was a bit annoying to download the application then immediately update to a full new application for the upgrade (I was on a slow international connection), but the application download was a lot smaller than the TT application anyway. Not an issue for 99.99% of users.  I hope that customers desert TT in droves so that this will be a pro-consumer lesson for future b-school candidates. This was a typical management-consultant kind of recommendation, and it usually works to extract money out of unwitting consumers. But this time around, consumers seem to be getting better educated. That's an important trend for a functioning capitalistic society.\n",

With the recent Quicken 2015 R6 bugs, a catastrophic failure didn't appear for up to two weeks after the R6 install, and Quicken's only solution was to recommend 1) customers restore from a backup from BEFORE when R6 was installed on your pc and 2) turn off certain functionality.  For customers who didn't retain (or make) backups prior to the R6 install, there were completely out of luck and lost years worth of financial data.\n",

      "5\tDon't know what I'd do without it. SO easy to use, and LOTS of special capture features. I'll use it until I turn back to dust!\n",
      "5\tThis is basically the free version bundled with all the free add-ons, which you can do yourself with the free version if you have the time to learn how to do it and do it (which is extremely easy by the way). The program is one of the best out there, however, because it lets you change the size of objects and customize them extensively. It does not have exactly the largest library of objects, but it is very versatile.<br /><br />The best feature of the program for me, besides the ease of the learning curve and the great and quick photo rendering, is the ability to customize objects, and even create new objects without 3D cad software. Each and every object can be shrunk, expanded, stretched and skewed every which way, stretching all the features proportionally. You can resize and shift any object in any way, with or without retaining the aspect ratio. One of the best features is that objects can merge with each other, meaning that they can occupy the same space at the same time. The reason why this is useful is because you can modify and create your own furniture pieces very easily by basically Frankenstein together existing shapes, but changing their texture and appearance, and then merging them together. A coke can with a matte carpet texture can become a lampshade, a basketball can become an oval art piece or a circular concrete building block. The possibilities are literally endless, as far as your imagination can take you. You can then easily group the items together and have new custom pieces created entirely within the program. To illustrate, I have attached a picture of a vintage, 1920s cherry wood bed with built in bookshelf and cabinets. It looks very close to the original, and was created using only 3 pieces existing in the program. A shelf, a rounded shelf, and a child bed. By expanding and contracting the pieces, and then merging them and pushing them together with the same texture, the end result can be achieved. Throw in a light source and a couple of pillows and the custom furniture, 1920s period bed was created. Show me another program that will let me do this in 10 minutes, and then create a photo rendering in 15 seconds, all for 15 bucks. Also attached is a detailed representation I did for a client representing an existing home office and library room. The room was created by customizing and creating pieces within the program, and it is entirely made up of the stock items and textures that came with the program, except for one texture on the floor.<br /><br />Fantastic product.nd the custom furniture, 1920s period bed was created.

This order includes a key and had to call Norton because I had Norton Internet Security on my laptop. There was not a place to enter a key code in Norton Internet Security. Had to do a chat with Norton. The nice lady at Norton deleted my old version of Norton Internet Security 2014 and installed the Norton Security 2015. They never told me that the old version was being discontinued and they were trying to charge me $79.00 for Norton discontinued software. Questionable marketing tactic ! It took about 20 minutes to do the whole process. Norton for some reason doesn't know that new 2015 software, their own software is now on my PC. I have gotten 4 emails wanting me to upgrade to their 2015 software. These guys (Norton) really don't have a clue. It's scary. I paid them for security but they (Norton) seem to be so incompetent. Norton can't figure out that their own software has recently been installed on my PC. What you are kidding me, no I'm not that's what happened.\n",

      "5\tI am (was) a 15 year plus TurboTax user.  Last year (2013 tax year), I had some ridiculous &#34;do-loop&#34; in trying to file my second state return with TurboTax.  I spent 20+ hours, quite literally, on the phone with several inept (& occasionally rude) TT reps, none of whom could resolve my issue or explain the loop. Had to file manually, by snail-mail. Vowed to try something different for 2014.  TT's marketing wizardry this year reinforced that decision.  Found just the program with H&R Block.  What I liked:<br />🔸 The reviews on H&RB software were excellent.<br />🔸 H&RB was half the price of TT, for basically the same package.<br />🔸 I've always liked TT's It's Deductible program for tracking property donations.  H&RB's version was as good, if not better (easy & fast to use).<br />🔸 The H&RB software was not as glitzy as TT, but I felt like I had more control and a better understanding of my income & deduction entries with H&RB.  The program seemed more transparent and gave me more confidence in my finished returns.<br />🔸 No unexplained do-loops.  File two states, Federal, and two kids returns with no problems whatsoever.  Seamless e-filing of all returns.<br />Overall, as pleasant an experience as filing income tax can possibly be - H&R Block's software took out most of the stress. I will most certainly be buying H&RB software for 2015's return.\n",

The database was also changed, not a surprise, but some categories were changed (Auto:Gas to Auto:Insurance) and in some cases, from Entertainment to Tax!?!  I ended up checking every line entry to track down the conversion errors, in checking and credit card categories.  I did not / do not use any other types (Investment, Liabilities, etc.)<br />The password vault...  Does. Not. Work.  Always end up entering ALL account password manually every time.

I called Intuit to get the Mac serial number.  I was not looking for an upgrade or a new version, just the software to run on my new Mac.  They would not allow me to get the Mac version and told me I had two choices, I could repurchase the same software and they would give me a 10% discount, or I can purchase a 150.00 copy of parallels to allow me to run it.  This is after sitting on the phone for over an hour just to speak with someone over in India.  I have purchased a copy of the software every year for 9 years hoping they fix this crap they call software.  Their lousy customer service combined with their crappy coded software, I am ending this 9 year relationship and divorcing myself of this mess from Intuit. Oh and BTW...love what you did with Turbo Tax, as well. Goodbye Intuit, you lost a loyal customer!\n",

I've never had Office but I did have a Microsoft Works program that did almost everything I needed to do. It could not however open some new database files I was needing to work with. So I down loaded this program. I haven't had time to really play very much with this thing yet but it seems clumsy to work with word files.

      "1\tQuicken for Mac is awful!  I bought my first Mac and immediately purchased Quicken.  We've had Quicken on our PC for over 10 years and loved it.  Immediately I had problems.  I transferred all my data and then downloaded from my bank accounts.  Instead of reconciling it made multiple duplicate transactions.  After trying to delete the duplicates I gave up and created a new file.  Again I downloaded the data from my bank account, added new transactions, and tried to reconcile.  That is when I realized that Quicken for Mac is nothing like Quicken for PC!  It will not reconcile to an online account.  Instead you have to choose the dates & opening and closing amounts.  That was very difficult to do within the reconcile window so I had to jump back & forth between that window and my main register.  As much as I tried I could not get the account to reconcile!  At one point I changed a transaction from a payment to a deposit and then back to a payment and instead of being back to my original balance my register was off even more.  I quit.  It was a waste of $60+!  Stick with the PC version or find something else until Quicken can fix the problems.\n",

I waited for 2 hours and no one answers. I am going back to HR Block next year, I've had it. This is just GARBAGE, why did I switch in the first place? I don't know.

If they do, I was unable to locate a number or email in order to ask them a question.

Whoever designed the &#34;intuitive&#34; walk-through, question process, seemed to design it for people with a finance background. I have 2 graduate degrees and a business background and I couldn't understand what the software was asking me many times. It would ask a question, and I would have to Google the terminology to decipher the question. I only hope I did my taxes correctly.

Definitely will be finding a new money management program - so annoyed with them I'll strongly consider a tax program not made by Intuit next year as well.\n",
      "1\tPoor support and on boarding, no phone support. The support techs all seem to have different ways of doing things.  My accountant, a professional, full time quickbooks pro advisor, has struggled for nearly 7 months to figure it out - it is completely different from quickbooks even they they are both supposed to keep the books. The import from quickbooks shows my balances off by more than $100,000 and NOBODY, ABSOLUTELY NOBODY, can explain why. The simple steps they tell us to do don't come close to helping solve the issue. We have probably opened 10 support tickets with them.<br /><br />They claim to sync automatically with your bank and credit cards. Good luck making that work for more than a few days, and good luck hoping it's correct. The third party company the partnered with for this service doesn't offer support, is discontinuing the product soon, and Xeros &#34;solution&#34; is to re-set it up every time. Really? 25 times entering the exact same username and password?<br /><br />We enabled their built in payroll system. Turns out that is provided by another company, and they don't support all 50 states. Now I have to do some payroll through their app and some manually.<br /><br />I found/hired a Xero certified accountant to work with my accountant. She is a great resource, but these problems have her flummoxed as well. She even complains about the varying support people and has us ask for the ticket to be assigned to certain support reps, because some of the things that they say are just off the wall whacked out when they don't understand the problem or have the slightest clue how to fix it.<br /><br />We are 8 months into our transition and still wondering if it's not smarter to go back to quickbooks (which I hate) or keep moving forward. Maybe someone from Xero support will read this and reach out and help us figure these problems out.\n",

      "2\tI currently have Quicken Deluxe 2004 on an old XP PC.  When I add a new entry, it moves on to the next entry instantaneously.  I downloaded Quicken Deluxe 2015 to install on my brand new high performance laptop running Windows 8.1.  I converted my existing database over.  When I try to add a new entry, it takes almost a minute for it to move on.  Is this supposed to be an upgrade??  I tried downloading the latest patches, but nothing leads to a useable result.  Update: July 11, 2015: Since I paid $40 for this software, I figured I should look a little more into what was causing the huge delays.  It turned out that the root cause was the excessive overdue reminders that were added to the list during the conversion process (reminders for things like restaurant purchases, payments to defunct cards, and many other things that no longer needed any reminders or never needed any reminders).  So, every time I would try to add a new entry, it had to search the thousands of bogus overdue reminders for a possible match.  After about an hour of deleting the reminders (one payee at a time since you apparently can't select a group of reminders to delete), it finally started to take much less time to process each operation.  It is now running nearly as good on my brand new laptop as the 2004 version did on a very old XP PC.  I pushed it up to 2 stars since it is an overall improvement (features-wise) compared to 2004, but I would never consider 3 or more stars since it does occasionally crash for no reason.  There was also some cleanup I had to do in the registers since during the conversion many bogus transfers were added between accounts with values in the quadrillions of dollars.  With the reminders cleaned up, it didn't take too long to get rid of those.  In short, I am happy to not need to use my old XP PC anymore, but I am not happy that I need to get used to the quirks of this new version of Quicken.  New versions of any software should generally be for providing a more useable, intuitive, streamlined, and faster interface.  This is not that.\n",

Per the Quicken help desk, they recommended updating to the latest version. When I updated to the latest version, the software wouldn't open which required an uninstall and reinstall. The Quicken help desk was unable to fix the issue and what was worse, it was a LENGTHY process to get my issue understood.

I had read many horror stories regarding the migration and subsequent attempts to get online downloads to function.  One would assume the transfer would be smart enough to move things over and avoid the need to have to do anything but that was not the case for me and I’m sure many others.  I believe someone else has already suggested this, but what you need to do to get downloads working on your accounts is:<br /><br />1. Go to Tool menu item and select Account List.<br />2. On the account list screen, where accounts you have set up for transaction downloads exist you have to click the Edit button and then enter the Account Details pop-up window.  Move to the Online Services tab.  Then click the Deactivate button which apparently cleans out old information causing the problems.  The Activate it and answer the questions for passwords, etc.<br />3. Repeat 2 for all the accounts you want to download.<br />4. I can’t remember the pop-up screen name, but you have to check the accounts you want to download and the stock quotations.<br />Hopefully these tips help.  I wish I had kept better notes when I went through this.  The key is deactivating the accounts and reactivating them.<br />Haven’t had any other problems as of yet, but I don’t use a lot of advanced features and it has been less than a week.\n",
      "1\tDo not buy this!!  Read these reviews http://www.consumeraffairs.com/computers/intuit_quicken.html<br /><br /> I was forced to buy Quicken 2015 if I wanted to continue to sync with my bank.  Low and behold, six months later, come tax time my password no longer worked and I have spend literally hours trying to get into quicken.  I work and have a small child and need to do my taxes.  No apology, no explanation.  This despite the fact that is it obvious all the technical support know there is a huge problem.<br />  Tech support has some kind of stalling tactic where they take literally 1-5 minutes to respond to something (e.g. customer support:  what version of Quicken do you have, Me:  Quicken 2015 Deluxe ..5 minutes... Them:  okay, thank you...).  I get the picture that they have thousands of people flooding chat but have been advised to not admit to this tremendous problem.<br />  I have stated point blank to them that it is obvious that there is a huge breach that has caused I'm sure thousands of us to not be able to do our taxes.  I have read other accounts that say Quicken has lost all their data (20 yr users) as well as demanded $300 or so for specialized support.  All, due to this problem caused by Quicken.  Instead of apologizing tech support completely ignores when I asked what happened and they continue the chat as if I said nothing.<br />  I actually think they are trying to stall this in whatever way they can.  For example, I could only get to a high level of tech support for a password reset if I was able tell them my actual specific balance of a bank or credit card account on a specific day they determined.  Now when I checked online, neither my bank or my credit card company could supply that information.  It also was not on my statements.  Of course this was more time spent on a wild goose chase that makes no sense.  I'm starting to suspect this is a stall tactic because Quicken doesn't know what to do about our problem.<br />Bottom line is that theyare trying hard to avoid a class action lawsuit.  Apparently they think consumers are too ignorant not to figure this out.  I suggest they switch tactics and instead of this game, sincerely apologize and update customers on the progress of this problem.  Otherwise, many of it's customers, myself included will switch over to another company and never buy from Intuit again.  This is no small decision as I have used them for at least 8 years.\n",

      "2\tI was forced to upgrade to Quicken 2015 because the 2012 edition would no longer download transactions from our financial services. There an enough complaints about that here, so I won't go into details.<br /><br />So I did the install. It did not give me any option as to where to install the product; it simply uninstalled 2012 and installed 2015. So there's no way to keep both versions on your system while you check out the new release. That is really stupid and inconsiderate towards users.<br /><br />Then it converted the database. Everything looked fine until I checked the balance on our business checking account, and it was *way* off. We use Savings Goals a lot. Q2015 did not import any of the deposit and withdrawal transactions for the savings goals. And it appeared that the savings goals were not connected to the checking account any more. I couldn't &#34;fix&#34; things by withdrawing the amounts back to the checking account, that just added the funds back and made the balance off even more. I finally had to delete the savings goals and add new ones, then deposit the amount they should have into them. And the checking account balance was still off by $920, so I had to make a manual adjustment to the account (payee: Quicken Screwup).<br /><br />And Intuit has completely messed up savings goals, IMNSHO. Instead of the account grid in previous releases, you get a page of HUGE buttons. Really, with only five savings goals and a monitor running at 1920x1080 resolution, I should NOT have to scroll to get to the last account! And it gets even better. The savings goals no longer remember the last account you deposited funds to. You have to select the account from the drop-down list every time. Since I do savings goal deposits every day, this is a big pain in the backside.<br /><br />So I have to agree with other reviewers that Intuit is not doing any significant improvements in new releases, and is in fact moving backwards in functionality. I also did not appreciate having to set up an &#34;Intuit Account&#34; just in order to use the product, and being nagged to use their cloud services and mobile apps.<br /><br />Quicken 2015 is functional for what I need, with some annoyances. But I am going to be looking for a replacement product.

The Fed tax can be easily submitted....but wait, in order to efile the state tax, you have to pay them an additional $25.

Installed on new laptop after transferring stored data using Carbonite. Quicken2015 immediately found my old 2014 data which I had backed up to old desktop. Very smooth. Did disconnect virus protection during installation as advised.<br /><br />BTW using Quicken since 1994 - love it.\n",
      "4\tI was a long time Norton user,even with the fact that I would get some nasty viruses that they could not get rid of. I had this until May 4,2015 when my expiration date was up. I never renewed,mostly due to the fact that it is not 100% and they changed the program yet again. I used Internet Security until that was changed to 360,now they have changed it again to something else. Maybe if they stopped trying to rename their products,changing the interfaces and actually focused on being a complete program that focused on getting rid of the viruses & malware I would have been happier.\n",
      "1\tI could not get it to work, asked for a refund from Amazon, and was told no!!!  I will not try to use H&R Block software ever.  I had to use a tax prep service to straighten out what this program messed up.  This was at an additional cost.  I will not buy tax software from Amazon, since this did not serve my needs, I should have been eligible for a refund, but NO.\n",

      "3\tInstalled this program on my laptop with no problem.  Had been using Norton 360.  Then my son tried to install on his laptop, which is much newer than mine, and it was a nightmare.  He finally got ahold of Norton tech, who logged into his computer and started deleting files and restarted the laptop. Then his laptop would not boot. Of course since it was on chat he got kicked off and had to wait for another representative. He finally gave up and used a different antivirus program.  Also, I keep getting emails from Norton telling me I'm not protected because Norton 360 has expired.  And Identity Safe takes a long time to load.\n",
      "5\tStill figuring it out (it has a LOT of features), but it's been a lot of fun! My husband and I just bought a house built in 1916. We're getting ready to restore the heart wood floors/trim in the original portion of the house, and update the newer portion. This program has been a great asset in helping us to visualize it from different points of view and generate some ideas. My only complaint is building the roof in this program. Since we have an older house (and it's had additions over the years) the roof is custom. Building that in HDS 2016 is prooving to be a serious challenge! :) But we'll figure it out!\n",

This year put in same deductions and Turbo Tax computed way different, didn't see the mistake it made until I hit the file button...I know my mistake but a whopping error that Turbo Tax made and even though it repeatedly checked it claimed all was right!!! So after I filed and printed I caught the error and tried to go back and recompute. It wouldn't let me, stuck with the mistake and now hoping IRS won't find it! Had to consult a real live tax accountant for a fee. He said let it go and IRS computer might not find it...if they do he'll ammend and I'll pay his fee, more tax plus intrest maybe not a penalty. Living with a cloud over my head....\n",

When you use the help line they didn't help me out at all they told me I need to go to one of their branches and have them done and pay more for someone to file my taxes for me.  Long story short I was not about to pay them twice for my taxes to be done so I went to a different place who had excellent customer service and got my taxes done correctly and quickly. I would have rated it a 0 star but it won't let me\n",

      "5\tI was amazed by this software and how easy it was to use. My tax man retired and moved to Florida, and I was a little hesitant about breaking in a new person after 33 years. I have known about Turbotax for years, but I didn't need it until this year. I am not tax savy or a computer geek, and I quickly found I did not have to be either. Turbotax is so user friendly that I felt I was dealing with a warm and knowledgeable person. The operation is so simple. Turbotax asked me questions, and I answered them. I could stop at any time and resume at any time. My taxes are not simple. With my tax guy, preparation would take between three and four hours. With Turnotax, I was finished in an hour and a half including filing. I got my state and federal refund a few days later, far faster than I did when I filed by mail. The key to an easy, successful session with Turbotax is to have all your pertinent tax information handy as you respond to the Turbotax questions. I plan to use Turbotax again next year, and I have no hesitation recommending it to a first time on-line tax payer.\n",
      "5\tTurboTax is easy to use, and if you own a rental property, will do a good job of maximizing deductions.\n",
      "4\tVery good product.\n",
      "3\tI have been using this software for several years with very little issues, until the 2014 version. There was a watermark with the word draft across all the forms that I printed out.

They said it was because I downloaded my banking accounts on line to update and I only do this with Well Fargo Bank. So will start to look for a new accounting software. I had trouble a year ago with quicken when I had done my update that they triple charged my bank account for the upgrade. Took a month to get all my money back from the billing problem. Maybe this is all from the Intuit site also where I did my updates and where I had to pay today to get the fixes done. Just not to happy right now with the Quicken programs!\n",

After downloading the software, you can click on the K icon to open it and at the bottom right corner you will see where it says &#34;expires in 30 days&#34; or less...depending on how long you waited. Click on that and you will see a code at the top of the page, click the x to erase it and then it will give you prompts to enter you name and place of purchase, then finally your key code to activate the software for 365 days.

Upon buying the product for $40 USD, I realized that I need to complete taxes for two states and an additional non-residence form. With this software, I could only complete the taxes for one state. To complete it for another state, I need to pay another $25. However, with the $25, I would still not be able to submit the non-residence form. Instead I had to go figure where the form is and than complete it myself. To complete the form myself and e-file, I had to redo my federal and states taxes online via efile and than pay $25 to efile. Hence, I decided to just complete my taxes via efile (which was only slightly more complex than turbo tax anyways) and just pay $25 to efile. In the end, I did not use turbo tax to file my taxes.  The $40 did not make my taxes easier and could not help me solve the complex issues of my taxes anyways. In the end I did it myself and the $40 was wasted. A refund in this scenario would be much appreciated.\n",

      "5\tThis is the 2nd time I've used TaxAct to do my taxes (have used turbotax and H&R block in other yrs) and I was fairly pleased. I also have a complicated tax situation and this program was able to handle all of the multiple sources of income, deductions, depreciation, etc. I did end up paying for several add-ons but I calculated the price in advance and it was still lower than what I would have paid with H&R block or turbotax. One thing to note is that you can get a special purchase offer when you first install this which is cheaper than if you go back and order it later. I did not initially buy the state add-on but after going through my state taxes and wasting a lot of time, I decided to purchase it and could not get the original deal that was advertised, so I ended up paying a bit more, I think $5 or so.\n",

It took a few hours because he has a lot on his Mac. When it was finished it surely did have many items Intego Mac caught. He had mailware, so many things that were slowing down his computer. It gives you so many options like clean up, virus protection. A great bundle.<br /><br />I tell him to run it once a week and he always comes up with something !!

I now own Magix Video Pro X7 and it is no different. Maigx says it can utilize more then 4 gigs? How about not. I use a software called iolo Live Boost and it tells me exactly how much RAM is being used and it never says more then 4 gigs. Now I also use Premiere Pro and it runs very smooth, it never freezes on me and it uses more then four gigs of RAM. I also use Photoshop and other complex software that never freezes. Only Magix video editing software does this. All versions freeze. For me, this software is not reliable enough to keep using. I wont get into my PC set up because i know it is powerful to say the least. I have provided one photo of many errors I get. I will provide more as I get them\n",

      "5\tFileMaker released the FileMaker 14 platform on May 12, 2015 adding exciting new features to all products in the FileMaker family including FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Pro Advanced (developer version), FileMaker Go, WebDirect, and FileMaker Server.<br /><br />Here we provide overview of some of the new features of FileMaker 14 along with a few notes and links to many resources for more detailed information. Some of the big goals of FileMaker 14 included:<br /><br />1. Creating solutions quickly and at low cost<br />2. Supporting mobile solutions even better<br />3. Delivering browser-based solutions with improved WebDirect<br />4. Making the platform reliable, secure, and scalable<br /><br />FileMaker 14<br /><br />Many of the features of FileMaker 14 are developer-focused enhancements. End users (those that may not actually develop or code) may not see them immediately, but they will see improved speed of delivery of new features and ability to create new functionality that was not possible in the past.<br /><br />The system requirements for FileMaker Pro are Mac OS 10.9 or Windows 7 and above. There are now separate versions of FileMaker for Windows 32 and 64 bit clients. Be careful with plugins that may only support the 32 bit version. You may need to update them first.<br /><br />The FileMaker interface has been modernized and has become more flat according to recent design trends.<br /><br />Script Workspace – Major changes have been made to the editing of scripts. You can now type scripts with context sensitive help.<br /><br />Calculation Dialog Box – All new and enhanced to make it as easy as possible to create calculations quickly.<br /><br />Design Tool Enhancements – Many tools and options are new or modernized<br /><br />* Improved Color Picker – With theme color options.<br />* Button Bars – You can now define a row or column of buttons with uniform size and formatting. They are made up of segments that are buttons or popover buttons. Text label, icon, or both can be added to each segment.<br />* Field Placeholders / In-Field Labels – Allow you to clearly label fields by showing what they are when empty without taking valuable screen real-estate.<br />* Button Icons – Custom Button Glyphs for buttons, popover buttons, and button bar segments…custom icon in .svg format. Conditional Formatting of the button icon also include color options.<br />* Navigation Parts – Top and Bottom Layout Parts<br />* Object component styles to control how objects look – Customize formatting of component parts of control styles: pop-up menu, drop-down list, drop-down calendar, checkbox set, and radio button set<br />Launch Center and File Icons – Present a new clean way to select databases.<br /><br />Minimalist or Minimalist Touch themes – New themes should start with these themes that provide a clean slate with no custom predefined styles.<br /><br />Better Starter Solutions – Event Management and Projects pre-built templates have been enhanced.<br /><br />FileMaker WebDirect<br /><br />WebDirect is the option that allows FileMaker databases to be deployed quickly to the web and maintain a lot of the FileMaker type of functionality.<br /><br />WebDirect is now substantially faster (up to 25%) and less resource intensive. Now the user limit has increased from 50 simultaneous users to 100. WebDirect now supports mobile browsers like Chrome for Android.<br /><br />FileMaker Go 14<br /><br />FileMaker Go provides more control on iOS through the following features:<br /><br />* The new user interface that cleans up the icons and makes them more intuitive.<br />* Rich text editing in fields.<br />* New Functions include: Get(ScreenScaleFactor), Get(MenubarState), and Get(TouchKeyboardState)<br />* Insert from Device now has additional customization options for signature capture<br />* Scripts that lock screen orientation (Portrait, Portrait Upside Down, Landscape Left, Landscape Right), enhance signature capture, allow control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations. It is more specific than Refresh Window [Flush cached join results].<br />* Show/Hide Menubar option for FileMaker Go and WebDirect<br />* Enable Touch Keyboard  for iOS or Windows 8 when then tap into an editable field<br /><br />FileMaker 14 Server<br /><br />Reconnect to server when a connection is lost in FileMaker Pro should save a lot of frustration. Previous versions of FileMaker Pro required login whenever a computer went to sleep or the network connection changed. It does this by allowing the fmreauthenticate extended privilege to apply to FileMaker Pro clients (not just FileMaker Go). If the machine goes to sleep when you return you are auto reconnected if time is within the limit. For example, fmreauthenticate120 would be a 2 hour setting (minutes). The maximum time limit is 10080 minutes or 7 days.<br /><br />The new Standby Server option for experienced system administrators aids in upgrades and maintenance. It takes over for a primary server if it is offline or unavailable. The server config and hosted data files must be identical. It can be used for unexpected failure of server due to power loss, hard drive, or catastrophe or a planned server outage. The changeover process is manual and configured by command line so it isn’t designed to be used as automatic failover. This second standby server does not require an additional software license. Progressive backup must be enabled for both installations.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />FileMaker 14 represents a big step forward in providing additional features, performance enhancements, and security / reliability while balancing it with maintaining it’s ease of use.<br /><br />Existing FileMaker solutions do not automatically gain all of the features of FileMaker 14. Some features will require reworking of layouts, scripts, and other objects…development time to take advantage of the new capabilities.<br /><br />We recommend that FileMaker users wait a while and do some testing with any existing solutions before deployment. If you’re building a brand new solution, dive right in and begin using FileMaker 14.<br /><br />FileMaker is 30 years old today (5/12/15) and this year the FileMaker DevCon (Developer Conference) is celebrating its 20th year. The platform has come a long way.<br /><br />http://cimbura.com/tech/2015/05/12/new-filemaker-14-released/low control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations.

      "1\tI just had an amazing experience trying to get Avast to stop auto renewing their product and debiting my account. Unlike other online subscription services, Avast provides only one very obscure and very poorly documented way to change your payment method or to update your subscription preferences. You cannot make changes through your account on their website and you cannot make changes through the account settings in the application. Telephone customer service cannot help, and several people on their forums confirm my experience of no response to service tickets. You have to find a well hidden link by searching the forums, then you have to enter information that is only available in the order confirmation email they send you each year. Only then do you get access to a link that opens a form that will let you manage your payment and subscription. Be aware that they assign you a different order number and password every time you renew, so you have to get the information from the most recent renewal and not from the original order. You will get a look at your order, but there will be no options to change your payment method or cancel your order. It looks to me like they contracted out their subscription management to Digital River and have not done a good job of integrating Digital River's processes into their own interface.<br /><br />If you like Avast and want to upgrade to a premium product, I highly recommend that you not give your credit card information to Avast. Instead I suggest you pay for it one year at a time by ordering through Amazon. Besides maintaining control over access to your bank account, you will probably pay a lot less each year.<br /><br />I have to say that I liked Avast. It was a friendly and effective product. A few years ago, they started pushing more and more promotions through the alerts in the system tray. It got to the point that I had to switch to a different product that maintained a lower profile.<br /><br />It took me almost 6 hours to figure out how to get Avast to not renew my license and stay out of my bank account. I am now using a different product that lets me manage my payment options directly and easily. It kind of felt like Avast had become the Malware that it is supposed to protect me from.

But Quicken 2015 is an embarrassment.  Installing it wasn't too bad.  But there are just little bugs everywhere.  The couple of new features they've added are minor.  Its much much slower.  Sometimes I have to click things 2x before it responds.  Random crashes.  And from reading Quicken Community forums things could be much worse.  People are getting locked out of their data files.  And Quicken doesn't seem to know what's going on.  I have no confidence they can get this stable and my guess is they'll leave it this way and move on to Quicken 2016 and ask us to upgrade to that too and consider it a bug fix release (as Quicken 2015 was supposed to be for Quicken 2014).  Its a real shame there isn't some real competition in this space, I'd jump in a second.\n",

Not recommended by me, and it falls short of the name &#34;editing&#34; and more in the category as a visual aid, but when the word &#34;FREE&#34; comes to mind, who can complain? Its features can still be used to get your point across.\n",

      "4\tSometimes you just have to upgrade to newer versions of software. I am glad that I finally upgraded as this version offers more features and lets me work more effeciently.\n",
      "4\tWorks pretty fast considering how many videos I load in there at once.\n",
      "1\tThis program does not work well at all.  Very hard to use. I would NOT recommend anyone purchase this program.  Waste of money.\n",
      "5\tSeveral months ago this occurred:  AVAST had just updated their engine/program to include a scan for network threats and found it.<br />Wave Broadband (our internet provider) technical support said that they had heard this problem was going around, but I was the first customer that they knew of that had an infected router.<br /><br />Our computers AND phone [Apple, Android, IBM (i.e., PC)...didn't matter] browsers would get slow, sometimes high jacked, but it was not within our devices.  Thus, I suspected a common pathway: Our router.  One Avast scan and it was detected.  Wave Broadband helped me reset the router and all is well now.\n",
      "1\tI used this program years ago, and found I would like to use it again.<br />I bought the CD but couldn't get it to install.  I had to scour the 'chat rooms' at Intuit and found several other people having the same problem.<br />I can't use the program because I can't create a user ID and Password.... correction, I have both (Intuit has sent it to me several times) but when it attempts to the 'server' it says it's *invalid*.<br />I try to make a NEW account, nope... email address is already taken.<br />Absolutely the WORST customer service you could possibly imagine!<br />Finally dug and found a real, honest to goodness phone number to talk to a real (non-caring) person and they eventually told me I was out of luck.... must be my server\\connection\\email\\proxy\\yada\\yada and I needed to fix that first because their server and software were perfect.<br />Told them I wanted to return the merchandise for a full refund. They said 'sure, where did you buy it?'  I told them, and they said 'oh, if you didn't buy it online from us, then you have to return it to the store you bought it from.'  *CLICK*<br />Phone went dead.  Went to Best Buy and they laughed and said &#34;We don't take back opened software&#34;.<br />Yeah.  I knew that.  I'm out $65 bucks and I will NEVER use INTUIT crap again.  They are NOT the company they were 20 years ago.  They are liars. cheats, and they SELL YOUR INFORMATION, yes, ALL of it.<br />Rot.  They just need to Rot.\n",

      "1\tI first began using Quicken DOS in about 1993 both in business and at home. Inexpensive, wonderful product, functional, dependable, totally intuitive. Help was easily available - but rarely needed. Then things began to deteriorate, each successive upgrade functioned a little less well.  Quicken finally hit bottom with 2013 home and office! Multiple features just don't work.  Trying to get reports on individual expenditures is an exercise in tooth gnashing frustration.  It appears not to be able to find its own categories.  Simple features like 'how much did I spend on?' are missing or only work for the last year or two.  Reconciliations are frequently wrong indicating that Quicken can't add and subtract consistently.  But worst of all - help is impossible to get!!!  Quicken has now barricaded itself behind multiple firewalls to be sure no one can call them.  I searched high and low for a number to call, was even willing to pay if I could just find out how to correct hopelessly wrong reconciliations. Impossible.  I would call numbers and be told that I needed to call a Canadian number which either didn't exist or else just referred me to their website - which was useless.  I've finally seen the light!  Never buy another Quicken product.\n",

      "2\tBeen using Quicken for 18 years. Currently use Quicken 2015 Premiere.  For over a month now, every time I try a One Step Update, the program freezes for about 10 minutes.  The problem is confined to updating stock quotes (all my other accounts update fine when I do them individually).  This problem continues despite new version releases R6 and R7 and validating data.  Many people have written to Intuit complaining of this and nothing has been resolved.  This is unacceptable\n",

      "5\tFileMaker released the FileMaker 14 platform on May 12, 2015 adding exciting new features to all products in the FileMaker family including FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Pro Advanced (developer version), FileMaker Go, WebDirect, and FileMaker Server.<br /><br />Here we provide overview of some of the new features of FileMaker 14 along with a few notes and links to many resources for more detailed information. Some of the big goals of FileMaker 14 included:<br /><br />1. Creating solutions quickly and at low cost<br />2. Supporting mobile solutions even better<br />3. Delivering browser-based solutions with improved WebDirect<br />4. Making the platform reliable, secure, and scalable<br /><br />FileMaker 14<br /><br />Many of the features of FileMaker 14 are developer-focused enhancements. End users (those that may not actually develop or code) may not see them immediately, but they will see improved speed of delivery of new features and ability to create new functionality that was not possible in the past.<br /><br />The system requirements for FileMaker Pro are Mac OS 10.9 or Windows 7 and above. There are now separate versions of FileMaker for Windows 32 and 64 bit clients. Be careful with plugins that may only support the 32 bit version. You may need to update them first.<br /><br />The FileMaker interface has been modernized and has become more flat according to recent design trends.<br /><br />Script Workspace – Major changes have been made to the editing of scripts. You can now type scripts with context sensitive help.<br /><br />Calculation Dialog Box – All new and enhanced to make it as easy as possible to create calculations quickly.<br /><br />Design Tool Enhancements – Many tools and options are new or modernized<br /><br />* Improved Color Picker – With theme color options.<br />* Button Bars – You can now define a row or column of buttons with uniform size and formatting. They are made up of segments that are buttons or popover buttons. Text label, icon, or both can be added to each segment.<br />* Field Placeholders / In-Field Labels – Allow you to clearly label fields by showing what they are when empty without taking valuable screen real-estate.<br />* Button Icons – Custom Button Glyphs for buttons, popover buttons, and button bar segments…custom icon in .svg format. Conditional Formatting of the button icon also include color options.<br />* Navigation Parts – Top and Bottom Layout Parts<br />* Object component styles to control how objects look – Customize formatting of component parts of control styles: pop-up menu, drop-down list, drop-down calendar, checkbox set, and radio button set<br />Launch Center and File Icons – Present a new clean way to select databases.<br /><br />Minimalist or Minimalist Touch themes – New themes should start with these themes that provide a clean slate with no custom predefined styles.<br /><br />Better Starter Solutions – Event Management and Projects pre-built templates have been enhanced.<br /><br />FileMaker WebDirect<br /><br />WebDirect is the option that allows FileMaker databases to be deployed quickly to the web and maintain a lot of the FileMaker type of functionality.<br /><br />WebDirect is now substantially faster (up to 25%) and less resource intensive. Now the user limit has increased from 50 simultaneous users to 100. WebDirect now supports mobile browsers like Chrome for Android.<br /><br />FileMaker Go 14<br /><br />FileMaker Go provides more control on iOS through the following features:<br /><br />* The new user interface that cleans up the icons and makes them more intuitive.<br />* Rich text editing in fields.<br />* New Functions include: Get(ScreenScaleFactor), Get(MenubarState), and Get(TouchKeyboardState)<br />* Insert from Device now has additional customization options for signature capture<br />* Scripts that lock screen orientation (Portrait, Portrait Upside Down, Landscape Left, Landscape Right), enhance signature capture, allow control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations. It is more specific than Refresh Window [Flush cached join results].<br />* Show/Hide Menubar option for FileMaker Go and WebDirect<br />* Enable Touch Keyboard  for iOS or Windows 8 when then tap into an editable field<br /><br />FileMaker 14 Server<br /><br />Reconnect to server when a connection is lost in FileMaker Pro should save a lot of frustration. Previous versions of FileMaker Pro required login whenever a computer went to sleep or the network connection changed. It does this by allowing the fmreauthenticate extended privilege to apply to FileMaker Pro clients (not just FileMaker Go). If the machine goes to sleep when you return you are auto reconnected if time is within the limit. For example, fmreauthenticate120 would be a 2 hour setting (minutes). The maximum time limit is 10080 minutes or 7 days.<br /><br />The new Standby Server option for experienced system administrators aids in upgrades and maintenance. It takes over for a primary server if it is offline or unavailable. The server config and hosted data files must be identical. It can be used for unexpected failure of server due to power loss, hard drive, or catastrophe or a planned server outage. The changeover process is manual and configured by command line so it isn’t designed to be used as automatic failover. This second standby server does not require an additional software license. Progressive backup must be enabled for both installations.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />FileMaker 14 represents a big step forward in providing additional features, performance enhancements, and security / reliability while balancing it with maintaining it’s ease of use.<br /><br />Existing FileMaker solutions do not automatically gain all of the features of FileMaker 14. Some features will require reworking of layouts, scripts, and other objects…development time to take advantage of the new capabilities.<br /><br />We recommend that FileMaker users wait a while and do some testing with any existing solutions before deployment. If you’re building a brand new solution, dive right in and begin using FileMaker 14.<br /><br />FileMaker is 30 years old today (5/12/15) and this year the FileMaker DevCon (Developer Conference) is celebrating its 20th year. The platform has come a long way.<br /><br />http://cimbura.com/tech/2015/05/12/new-filemaker-14-released/low control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboards.<br />* The new Refresh Portal script command can speed up some operations.

      "1\tHorrible, horrendous, awful... This pretty much sums it up. Since the update to this version (forced by Quicken, btw. that would kill my access to web connect if I kept using 2010 version past May 2015), I lost connection to Citibank and CapitalOne. I am not able to remove/add as it won't let me link to an existing account (nothing in the list) and instead insists on creating a brand new account. More? If I do update of all accounts, only some get updated, and others I have to go in manually and do one by one. More? There is more, but Im to pissed to list. I am writing to Amazon for a refund. This is outrageous! What a piece of sh**t software!!!\n",

      "5\tI was skeptical at first to purchase this after all the negative and so-so reviews about how hard this is to install.  I'm good with computers and software installation, so I took the leap and bought it despite the reviews.  I was confused at first because all Amazon gives you is a license, but their is nowhere in Zen to put a code.  So, I turned to the AVG website and used their live chat where I felt like an idiot because of how simple this is.  Turns out the setup process for this is the most ridiculously easy process as long as you know where to start.  Let me share the secret so that anyone having problems can get this up and running fast.<br /><br />Go to:<br />https://app.avg.com/us-en/code<br /><br />Paste in the code Amazon gave you.<br />-Note: Make sure you have setup a MyAVG Account.  If you haven't then go here first: https://myaccount.avg.com/ and setup an account with the email address you want everything connected through.<br /><br />Scroll down to the bottom and hit &#34;Activate Now&#34;.<br />-It should then give you the option to Download for all the various devices this thing covers.  I had been using the 30 day free trial so I was able to skip that download step.  If you haven't been using the free trial then go ahead and download it from here.  If you have used the free trial then move onto the next step.<br /><br />Go to your already installed AVG Zen and at the top right of the screen look for the connect button which is right next to the messages button.  In my case that shows the email address the account is setup through.  It showed &#34;connected&#34; after I did the update because of the trial I'd been using so click on that and choose to logout.  You'll need to refresh your login for Zen to recognize your new license.<br /><br />It should now give you the option to log back in.  Be sure to select the option to login with a MyAVG Account.  Use the exact credentials you used when you registered your license.<br /><br />Now that you are logged in it'll flash a few times as it connects with your account and recognizes your license.  It'll say you're not protected for a moment as it switches from your free trial to your license.  Be patient for a moment and let the program do its thing as it updates.<br /><br />Restart your computer and when it comes back up you should be good to go.<br /><br />To be sure that everything is active check your Zen and it should be green across the board and show PRO in green as well in the top right corner of each product button.<br /><br />To connect other devices you can follow these AVG instructions if you're having problems:<br />https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en_US&urlname=Create-a-Zen-Network-and-connect-AVG-Zen-apps-to-your-network<br /><br />A few easy steps and you're ready to use this surprisingly easy to install product.  My recommendation to Amazon would be to at least list the first link in their product description because if you know where to start the rest of the process is easy.  I hope this has helped.\n",
      "5\tI ended up ordering the downloaded version and I am glad I did! I downloaded this for the Macbook Air 13inch. Took around a half hour for it to completely download. I found the product key under history of orders under my amazon account. Downloaded great and definitely worth it as I need word and powerpoint on my macbook air!\n",

If the machine goes to sleep when you return you are auto reconnected if time is within the limit. For example, fmreauthenticate120 would be a 2 hour setting (minutes). The maximum time limit is 10080 minutes or 7 days.<br /><br />The new Standby Server option for experienced system administrators aids in upgrades and maintenance. It takes over for a primary server if it is offline or unavailable. The server config and hosted data files must be identical. It can be used for unexpected failure of server due to power loss, hard drive, or catastrophe or a planned server outage. The changeover process is manual and configured by command line so it isn’t designed to be used as automatic failover. This second standby server does not require an additional software license. Progressive backup must be enabled for both installations.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />FileMaker 14 represents a big step forward in providing additional features, performance enhancements, and security / reliability while balancing it with maintaining it’s ease of use.<br /><br />Existing FileMaker solutions do not automatically gain all of the features of FileMaker 14. Some features will require reworking of layouts, scripts, and other objects…development timeto take advantage of the new capabilities.<br /><br />We recommend that FileMaker users wait a while and do some testing with any existing solutions before deployment. If you’re building a brand new solution, dive right in and begin using FileMaker 14.<br /><br />FileMaker is 30 years old today (5/12/15) and this year the FileMaker DevCon (Developer Conference) is celebrating its 20th year. The platform has come a long way.<br /><br />http://cimbura.com/tech/2015/05/12/new-filemaker-14-released/\n",

It is a hog and many features that worked well with v14 such as memorized categories no longer work.  If I could back convert, I would\n",
      "1\tFirst program I tried to open... blocked. I allow the blocked program access in both firewall and omit it from anti-virus scans... still blocked. It won't allow you to take any action to unblock the program through the history page. (Some allow you to change it from blocked to unblocked so you don't have to track down the specific file that is causing the problem.) I open the internet and go on to Amazon to write a bad review... keep getting errors that make me have to kill the pages. I've had Norton 360 on my PC for years and although I didn't LOVE it, I didn't LOATHE it. This freaking thing sucks. You shouldn't have to spend hours trying to find ways to use legitimate/trusted programs already on your computer and hours searching for a human to address the problem. Oh, I had to uninstall the program to actually write this review.   Update:  Norton support spent well over three hours trying to figure out and fix the issues. Be prepared to spend time as well as money if you order this program. I don't have any special or odd programs on my pc (which I bought less than a year ago), and used Norton 360 with no issues. They told me to install the program before they did a remote connection but the remote connection wouldn't work until I uninstalled the program. After the technician tried (and failed) to get my pc to work after re-installing Norton, I was transferred to a higher level technician. After several, &#34;I think I fixed it... oh, hang on&#34;... Norton seems to have no more issues letting me load Amazon (it wouldn't even let me load Norton website without giving me grief). I am mollified now that I have a working pc that is secure but it was such a long road to get to this point. I'm exhausted and wasted my entire afternoon and most of my evening. Ugh! I'm drained.\n",

      "3\tEasy to use with good features - and it's cheaper than Adobe Acrobat. However, there is a major issue that might make you want to avoid it like the plague! If you add hyperlinks within a document (if you're creating an index or TOC for example) then the links will work perfectly within Wondershare but will all be one page out if the PDF is viewed in other tools. This makes it problematic if you want to distribute the PDF to customers who mainly use Acrobat Reader to view (all your index and TOC entries will be one page out). It's infuriating.\n",
      "5\tI write long, technical reports for a living.  Microsoft dominated the word processing market with &#34;Word&#34; years ago but I have remained a devoted WP fan.  There really is little comparison in terms of user friendliness and intuitive operation.  I just needed to add WP to a laptop and could not locate my older version so I bought this.  I don't see a lot of difference between this and the older (4) version I had been using.  WordPerfect is a very good and easy to use word processing program.\n",
      "2\tNorton's big selling point for this product is that they incorporated all the features from previous security products into this one product.<br /><br />So I bought it, installed it and after a hour with a support person was told that they didn't include network security features with the product this year. Be careful that you only need basic security features if you decide to buy it. You may not get what you got from previous products.\n",

      "3\tMy husband and I have been using the TurboTax program to file our taxes for about 8 years now.  This year TurboTax changed their program, but they did fix many issues before we filed.  We really do like the ease of use of the program, however, we discovered this year that the first-time homebuyers loan/tax repayment has been miscalculated on our 1040 for the past 5 years-sigh! We will be contacting Intuit about the issue to save anyone else the headache we now face.\n",
      "1\tWhile I always do my best to find the silver lining in most every product I purchase, Quicken for Mac 2015 will receive no such generosity from me. This is a $70+ re-hash of the same junk program that I purchased a hand full of years ago. Perhaps, it is my hopeless optimism...or, more likely, my sheer laziness and disinterest in learning a completely new personal finance software product; but I truly was hoping that Intuit might show a concerted effort in improving its previous lackluster offering. Not to be. This is lipstick on a pig (no, Sarah Palin did not coin that phrase...she was not sharp enough). It is basically a redesign of its previous version. In fact, little is different aside from the appearance. Granted, there are a couple of areas in the investment and loans sides of things that have improved (albeit minimally), but, generally, the bones are the same. Want the capability to create a budget for the year that flows and makes sense?.....Nah. You don't need it. Want a more streamlined appearance so that your accounts, next to your register, and all of the categories and memos, and notes and deposits and payers and payees and blablalbah looks like something that flows and makes sense?...nah. You don't need it. Want to talk to someone online or on the phone that has the slightest clue and is understandable?...nah. You don't need it. Hmmmm...it appears I've found my new theme. I've spent my $71 so that you don't have to. Trust me, you don't need it! Unless, of course, you had the previous product and you still want to connect to your banks online. Then... I guess you do!\n",

I got a notice that if I wanted to continue doing so, I had to spend almost $70 to buy the 2015 version - and that was WITH the \\\\\"\"discount\\\\\"\".

The amount doubled in the transfer from Fed. form to State.<br /><br />Then the state (Michigan) portion had an even worse omission.  In Michigan, the first $20,000 of pension income is exempt from state tax.  This software did not automatically perform that function, nor it would not allow me to do it manually.  In addition, it would it allow me to manually correct the doubling error noted above.  I paid for the state tax software but had to do that by hand.<br /><br />H&R Block customer service line recommended I go to a field office as they could not help me.  The person at the office saw the problems I was having and recommended I DO THE TAXES BY HAND!!!<br /><br />H&R Block did a survey and asked me about my satisfaction with the product.

The updates take 3-4 times as long to download as Norton, and if you run a scan - might as well go run some errands in town 'cause you won't be using your computer for a while.  Don't get this!\n",
      "5\tYears ago prior to switching to Cook’n as my choice software for recipe (and more) maintenance I spent several months reviewing the products available prior to making the decision.  As a dual Mac and Windows family I liked that the same application could run on both platforms and interact with each other; and you didn’t have to purchase a different license for each platform.  Through the years as computer capabilities have changed Cook’n has been adapted to enable the family to be more mobile with access to your recipes, meal plans, and nutrition information remotely.  I made the choice to switch based on the above capabilities but what has impressed me most since I started using Cook’n is the customer service and support provided.  Running Cook’n on Mac and Windows desktops, an iPhone, and an iPad is beneficial but all the changes in these software systems can create challenges to any software developer.  When issues have arisen through all the changes the Cook’n support staff has ALWAYS been very responsive to get my issue resolved and operational in a timely manner.  My most recent error message on the Mac was resolved within 44 minutes of my notification to the support team.  Cook’n staff consistently asks for recommendations and follow-up up to ensure problems are resolved.  I recommend Cook’n a your recipe software of choice.\n",

      "3\tI have used WP since before there were version numbers. I prefer it to Word for a number of reasons, particularly the &#34;reveal codes&#34; that allows me to see the codes I am editing.  However, WPX7 continues to hang when editing a document that contains headers and footers (my personal #1 complaint) as well as at other random times that seem to occur only when deadlines must be met.<br /><br />The ability to open multiple windows is an improvement; however, when WP crashes, the automatic backups interfere with restoration since each must be addressed without any knowledge of what it was before the crash. (I am so paranoid about losing work that I backup every 5 minutes -- not a good sign.)<br /><br />I bought this version for two reasons:  First, I hoped that crashes would occur less frequently. I know other WP &#34;fans&#34; have complained about WP's instability and Corel's failure to take these complaints seriously - as evidenced by the fact that many of these comments are the same as those made several years ago (version 9 to date?).  Second, I expected it to run better and faster in Windows 8 in 64 bit mode.  As far as 64 bit -- I have not seen any significant improvements in processing speed that cannot be explained by the fact that I have a much faster processor.  Otherwise, I don't see any improvements resulting from more efficient software solutions.<br /><br />I sum - I continue to use WP. I just wish that the folks at Corel would focus on getting rid of the bugs before announcing a &#34;new and improved&#34; version of a classic.\n",

In the case of Quicken, it seems that the conventions are entirely different and they have gone to great lengths to avoid &#34;financial mumbo jumbo&#34; and in the process of using that approach, they make it almost impossible to do things like print a simple report or do a &#34;quick report&#34; on a particular &#34;customer.&#34;  No complaint at all about the vendor here or the service; my gripe is with the software itself, which I have been using for at least a dozen years now.

So long as the IRS doesn't come after me I'm good with it, but I do have questions about its accuracy.

I usually purchase a package for several devices so that I can protect all of my computers, including my desktop, laptop and tablet. I purchased the security package from Amazon because it was, by far, the best price ( I know because I researched this !).Once I purchased it, I received an email in minutes for the download, which was quick and easy. No problems - Highly recommended!\n",

      "3\tThis version lacks some features that are on the higher priced packages. But, I don't miss those features. Interface with other programs is often slow and erratic. I use the simple word processor that comes with Dragon then cut and paste into other programs as needed. The bottom line is voice recognition. It is far from perfect but still quite useful for some one with clunky fingers like me. The program will often surprise me with what it can recognize faithfully, and also surprises me with what it doesn't know or doesn't reproduce faithfully. It is a mix. I don't think the learning feature works very well. I try to train it to recognize certain words but he program often ignores me and defaults to the undesired response. For people who type very well this program may be more of an intrusion than a help.\n",

I don't understand why intuit thinks they need to keep track of my person finances with their online system but i don't like the idea.  so if you have the previous versions my advice to you is to keep it because you wont be able to download transaction anyway.  and you cant manually download .QIF files for credit card or bank statements either\n",

The first and most obvious task, in my opinion, was to input the parameters of my lot and set the building envelope.  Whoops, can't do that.  Very disappointed to see that there is no product return (see below).  I foolishly relied on the mostly glowing comments from the PC/Mac version of the product, which of course is the same software -- just on a different Amazon page.  Bummer.  I did learn that one can return the product directly to the manufacturer.  At least that's what their website claims.

Replaced Quicken Deluxe 2012 with 2015 because I had to be to able to download transactions.  2015 is distinctly worse than 2012 and has serious problems reconciling and matching manually recorded transactions with downloaded transactions.  Often they have the same check number, but Quicken won't let me match them or complains of a duplicate check number when I do.  Never had any problems with 2012 or previous version (I started using Quicken in the early 2000s).  I intend to complain directly to Quicken, but I think it is time to look for a better solution to keeping track of my money.<br /><br />I was also excited to try the phone App with 2015 - thinking I could easily manually enter transactions when I make the purchase, instead of keeping the receipts until I entered them later on my computer.  Boy, was I wrong.  Sadly, it is easier to keep receipts then fight with the Quicken App.\n",

However, now that I've used it for a while, I'm growing accustomed to it. There are several new features in 2015 that I like (e.g. tags, more downloading choices), and it seems to have all the functionality of 2007 and then some. Amazingly, all my 2007 data (which started in 2000) transferred flawlessly, which was one of my biggest concerns. The reporting function is different, but once I figured it out, all the reports I used before are available. All in all, I'm a happy camper and see no need to switch to one of the Quicken for Mac competitors.\"\n",

I guess I can &#34;justify&#34; the bill pay $9.95 a month, as my banks bill pay is much clunkier and less friendly. Every three years I bristle at the planned obsolescence mandatory upgrade, but I do it. Next year 3 year cycle may be not. This &#34;upgrade&#34; was the worst of the bunch with having to deactivate / reactivate / duplicated entry of bill pay in the one step update which then freezes the program. It is my opinion that this business model, of Intuit, is an example of how screwed the corporate culture is where the revenue stream supersedes any concept of quality product. I guess the good news is it seems so similar to 2012 that there has been no learning curve, other than unchecking the duplicated box in the update. I paid for the update and grifted Intuit some 2 hours of my life.\n",

      "1\tI had Quicken 2012 for a few years and was recently forced by Intuit to upgrade to Quicken 2015.  Quicken 2012 was relatively bug free for me but the upgrade to 2015 has been painful.  I have &#34;connectivity problems&#34; on a regular basis which I never saw with Quicken 2012.  Quicken asks you to reset your accounts.  I have 10 accounts and I've reset most of them dozens of times.  I usually get them all to work for a day and then I have to reset them all again.  The other problem is that the system is putting transactions in the wrong accounts for some reason and missing many transactions. This forces me to print out statements and check each entry an move it if it needs to be moved or add it if it needs to be added.  For example, Quicken is putting my wife's IRA transactions into my kid's 529 account.  Every month I am missing dozens of transactions from several accounts.  This is a total nightmare.  Not sure if there are really any other options but if you don't need the automatic download of transactions, I would consider tracking your accounts in excel if you have any proficiency.  Not a great option for me but if I can't get it to work after a few more weeks of trying, I'm done with Quicken for good.<br /><br />My wife is wondering why I'm spending so much time cursing at the computer for the last few months. I've spent dozens of hours trying to fix the issues with this garbage software and haven't actually analyzed my accounts in months because I am spending so much time clearing everything up.<br /><br />p.s. I wrote this entire review while Quicken was trying to &#34;reset&#34; one of my accounts for the tenth time and I still see the spinning wheel.  I am not a fast typist.\n",

While entering data, I got to a point where I realized that I may have made a mistake at an earlier step, and I tried to go back one step to make that correction, only to be taken back several steps, after which I was unable to get back to where I was - not to mention the fact that I was unable to find the location of the error that I had suspected. It appeared that I would have had to start the whole process all over in order to make the correction. Now it is possible that some of this may be user error or user's lack of knowledge on the use of this software; I still think that navigation, particularly where it involves going back a step or two, could have been easier. As for the lack of features which were standard in previous editions of this software (that so many have complained about), I was not affected by this. But I can understand the frustrations of those who were. Of course, Intuit finally listened and made a somewhat just remedy for the problem. Overall, a very good software.\n",

The Ohio small business form was not included and you had to download it on your own.  Was a very confusing form that turned out to be really simple but the states instructions were terrible.  Too bad TT did not include it in their product with instructions.\n",

But I have a few complications, and in the past TurboTax Deluxe was good enough.  This year, they modified their feature sets, so I opted for TurboTax Premier.  What a disaster.<br />The problems are:<br />1) The interface for handling ISOs and ESPP stock transactions is cumbersome.  I know tax rules changed, but it is much more cumbersome than the interface from Turbotax 2013, while the information needed for the new tax rules really is NOT much more.<br />2) Handling disposition of partnership interests where a 1099 was also issued is about as bad as it gets.  You can handle it with TurboTax 2014, but there is enough paper tracking, manual calculation, and manual entry that the software provides no benefit vs. doing it on paper the old school way.<br />3) WORST OF ALL, there appears to be a security leak that allowed fraudulent e-filing of Federal taxes, so that the perpetrators could get refunds deposited to ad hoc bank accounts.<br /><br />Buying Turbotax Premier 2014 was a total waste of money, and I look forward to joining the class action suit for the security issue.  Thanks to good timing in dealing with the fraudulent e-file, I'm only taking a loss for the cost of Turbotax Premier, but honestly that's about all I expect a class action suit would get me.\n",

After my upgrade, I was unable to initiate any transaction downloads.

After all, the software simply needs to download transactions from my bank.  There were lots of problems with the software but I was able to make it work.  Then I was notified that I needed to purchase (at a discount) the upgraded program, Quicken for Mac 2015.  It is a disaster.  Even though I can connect directly to my bank (SunTrust) twenty-four hours a day without going through Quicken, Quicken can't seem to figure out how to connect to SunTrust Bank and download my transactions.  After sending daily reports of the &#34;error 101&#34; for ten days and getting a computer-generated message saying the problem is being addressed, I contacted Quicken's help people.  Their response was in effect to say (1) they were sorry; (2) they are working on it; and (3) sometime in the future I would get an email when the problem is solved.  No one should even consider purchasing Quicken for Mac 2015.  I have not been able to download transactions from my bank, and Quicken's help desk has no idea when or if the problem will be solved.\n",

And I know I should.<br /><br />I posted the question on the Quicken Help forum but naturally no one will reply to that.  I didn't pay $80 to download flat files from VNB's website and upload it to Quicken.  That is not a solution.  I might as well be entering manually.<br /><br />This is a major disappointment.

      "1\tThe only reason I'm using this is because I'm used to Quicken 2012 and this product allows me to continue to download my transactions automatically and project the available balance for my multiple checking accounts.  I wouldn't call this an upgrade, however.  Product functionality is reduced when compared to what I was using before.  For example, the software didn't lock up while I was using it (specifically referring to the Planning functions at this point).  If you're upgrading from a previous version, I HIGHLY recommend you look at their forums on the bugs before starting the process.  (Side note: the &#34;reset account&#34; function for your online banking services doesn't work from the upgraded version.  Also, you'll want to deactivate ALL of your accounts before re-establishing the services so you're not linking the accounts individually.  The linking was glitchy with some of my banks, so you just have to be patient with the software and repeat the linking process when at first it doesn't want to work.  Also, software error with patch R6 caused users who opted to password-protect logging into the software, such as myself, were locked out of the software and were forced to uninstall/reinstall Quicken 2015 once they'd removed R6 from the server, and then reload their Quicken data from a backup.).  I am hoping the synch function will be a saving grace for this alleged upgrade and that the next patch will make the software stop crashing.\n",

Very little need to know about tax laws, etc. Occasionally after an error check they ask you to fill in a blank on a form that requires some translation from account-type jargon, but most of it is explained in the more user friendly input format that is used as an interface for you to input your specific numbers. For some reason unknown to me, federal e-file is free, but the state e-file is not. Also, they include one free download of a state, but charge what seems to be quite a bit for the second state. This seems weird to me. I simply rent out a house in another state, have very little to claim. Seems like it would cost turbotax very little to allow a user to download an extra state. Mostly, I'm pretty pleased, fairly quick input system, pretty thorough question and answer system, and fairly glitch free program for a small family run business.\n",
      "3\tWorst software from any reputable software company! I have been using Windows version of Quicken for more than 10 years.  The only reason I am still having a PC is because I have to use Quicken on it.  Finally I decided to give its Mac version a try with knowing the negative reviews.  Boy, I have never imaged an Apple approved software can be this bad:  After imported from 2015 Windows version, all account login info are lost, though 90% data is still there (yes, some accounts just lost), you have to setup those account again, but the new account will not match with the remaining imported data, so you pretty much has to delete them and download again...  If they cannot get this right, who knows what kind of problems they may have...  BTW, during these several hours, it crashed itself, locked up my online login... Very disappointed with Intuit and Apple.  [Update] Since I cannot return a software, after a while, I decided reinstall and give it one more try.  While, this time, I didn't use the converter to process my Windows version export, signed in using quicken id and it actually worked for majority of my accounts.  So I have raised the stars to three.  Meaning it is usable.\n",
      "5\tVery easy to use. I have a small number of stocks and Turbo Tax makes it very easy to put all the transactions into the correct entries. It is especially greats since all I have to do is select my online broker, enter some key information and TurboTax will import all this required information for me. This also works for W2 if your company uses a payroll company (most of the large ones do)<br /><br />Turbo Tax uses and 'interview' process asking the questions as you go through the different sections of filling out the Federal Tax forms. Saves a lot of time and, as noted previously, puts all the entries in the correct location and forms. I was able to complete my entire income tax session in a matter of a few hours.<br /><br />Online filing is very easy to use. A couple clicks and the filing is done. Afterwards I'll make a full backup copy of everything onto a CD, file it away with some hard copies.<br /><br />Making an addendum is also easy. I had to do this one year and took a short amount of time and was able to file online<br /><br />Have used Turbo Tax for 15 years and will continue to use them.\n",
      "4\tThis wasn't as easy to use as the last few years I've used this product. It needs to go back to the former setup in my opinion.\n",

      "5\tGreat price! Catches pretty much everything! I really like the Norton Vault. I can store all of my passwords in a safe vault and when I log in to a website, the vault puts the login information for me. If I have multiple logins, it will ask which one I want to use. Very handy!!\n",
      "1\tTerrible software.  Incorrect calculations, ignoring my 401k entries entered on the k-1 form, program tells me some of my K-1 entries require me to &#34;revise my return accordingly&#34;  Isn't that what I am paying for your program to do?  Never had this problem with Turbo Tax.\n",
      "4\tI have tried many different tax packages, and they all have limitations.  I have used H&R Block now for years without issue, and each year it gets a little better.  My primary complaints are:<br /><br />1.  When you have an error, it is sometimes difficult to see exactly what caused it.  On occasion, I have entered &#34;0&#34; on a line I should not have touched and this has required that I delete an entire form to move past the error.<br /><br />2.  Navigation and searching after the wizard steps is often clunky.<br /><br />3.  The user interface is stale.<br /><br />In spite of this, the wizard interface is very easy, the ability to bring forward previous year's returns saves hours of data entry, and overall the package is very easy.  If you have a small business or a part-time consultancy, this package is very helpful.  If they could resolve the usability issues I would give it an unqualified five stars.\n",
      "4\tI can do many different things and be very creative from business flyers to webpages to personal gift cards\n",
      "1\tSo much program that it had my computer freezing up all the time. Went online with one of their Reps, he couldn't straighten it out. Uninstalled it and use Microsoft Defender. Works much better, hope it is as good protection.\n",

      "5\tThis is my second year for purchasing McAfee Total Protection, my first year to purchase from Amazon.  I love the program, and it keeps my PC protected.  It was much less expensive to purchase through Amazon.\n",
      "5\tgood price\n",
      "1\tIt is GARBAGE!  Locked up my computer and kept on crashing it. The worse thing about it was I first tried the free trial version and used it for 30 days before buying the registered version and the trial program worked just fine. Not so with the paid version. It took me a week of tearing my hair out trying to just unistall it. Finally got rid of it. It was like having MALWARE in my computer.<br />DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS PROGRAM!\n",
      "5\tI have been using Turbo Tax since it was invented!! It is so easy to use and has been an excellent tool to keep track of my farm tax liability and my small business tax liability. The e-file capability results in very fast responses from the IRS and I feel very confident that my filing was accurate and optimized. Many thanks for years of providing an excellent tax tool.\n",

      "1\tSomebody tell me why the _____ it's so hard to create software that provides bill scheduling in calendar format?! None of the transactions downloaded are properly matched, the software itself spams me (asking me to upgrade, purchase other software), occasionally the software just takes a $hit and I have to start over with a NEW data file. This software is crap and should be killed with fire and the Mac version is complete garbage. Die Intuit, die!\n",
      "3\tI have used this software for several years and it works just fine.  This year, however, I moved and had to file two different state returns.  I had paid $20 for this software which included the state program.  But for the second state return, I had to pay them AN ADDITIONAL $40!!!  I felt this was more than excessive.  I have to file two state returns again for 2015 and will look elsewhere for my software.\n",
      "4\tI had been using Quicken 2012 and updated to 2015 only because my financial institutions no longer supported downloads into 2012.  In the couple of weeks I have used 2015, I have found only a few insignificant alterations.  I see no reason to be forced to pay over $44.00 once again when the older product was sufficient!  Intuit has a great money making scheme going!\n",
      "1\tIt just doesn't work. I've been using the same version of Quicken for the last 4 years, without issue. I was forced to buy 2015 when the software suddenly decided to stop downloading transactions. Nothing about the standard OFX protocol or my bank's servers have changed. It's merely a way for Intuit to include a planned obsolescence in their product and force you to pay again.<br /><br />Yesterday, I wasn't able to download any of my new bank transactions.<br />Today, I can't even open my Quicken file to view my past transactions, because there's something wrong with the Intuit server.<br /><br />The new 2015 version appears no different from 2011 that I was used to, besides:<br />- new colors<br />- a mobile app<br /><br />I just installed GnuCash, which is a free financial tracking tool. As far as I can tell, it does everything I use Quicken for:<br />- Automatically downloads transactions<br />- Ability to categorize (and split) transactions<br />- Track my investment accounts<br />- Create bill reminders<br />- Generate reports of spending activity<br /><br />Setting up my online banking was simple (obviously the problem with my Quicken isn't my bank's fault).<br /><br />The budget feature is also MUCH better. It looks exactly like the Excel spreadsheet I created to better visualize my spending activity, only I now no longer need to transfer the data between the programs.\n",
      "4\tGreat for keeping track of finances.\n",
      "1\tProbably would have appreciated it more if I could have gotten it downloaded from Amazon's<br /> downloading website.  As it was, I couldn't get it downloaded so did my taxes the old fashion way - using IRS forms readily available via the internet.\n",
      "5\tStill finding out all the little things this software can do but for someone who's not used to working with this sort of thing it's amazingly easy to use and can do so many cool little tricks. A great value for the money\n",

Their rep was unable to solve the issue after 2 hours of work.  We made arrangements for her to call back in a specified time window and she never called.

Once I updated to Quicken 2015, I found it was a little different getting used to where things were after using Quicken Essentials and other Quicken products.<br /><br />Now that I have had a few weeks to adjust, I have found  2015 has all the same results I needed, just in different locations. The real beauty now is that I can take it with me when I am on the road using either my Samsung Smartphone or my Apple iPad2. The syncing function doesn't seem to always be in sync, but that may just be me getting used to how the function actually works. More later after I use it for a while.\n",

If you already have either web storage or ftp storage account, the Amazon cloud has no benefits or conveniences at all.<br /><br />Come on Amazon, we know you can create a good cloud interface if you want to.

I'm always happy with the walk through instructions from Turbo but you can easily skip sections that are not pertinent. If you've never used Tubo Tax, you will appreciate the fact that it profiles your personal and employment info from your prior year and will prompt questions such as &#34;Did you pay ABC Child Care again this year?&#34;.

When the software kept crashing when generating the slideshow, that I just worked all night on, I decided to move the software to a higher end PC to render the movie.  I then was told that I needed to deactivate the old license - no problem except they restrict you to a minimum activation period of 30 days.  I now can't make a slideshow or even reinstall the software on a new PC.  This should be illegal!  I understand piracy concerns, but I am a paying customer.  I will never support this company again, and I recommend you take your money elsewhere.\n",

(Game engines have their own renderer, you don't need the Renderer in Maya LT.  LT does however include Hypershade where you can author your textures and see exactly how they will look once in your game engine!)<br /><br />In no way does this make the package unusable for what it was placed onto the market for; creating 3D animated and textured assets for your games.<br /><br />Maya LT 2016 has even added Sculpting and 1-button export into Unreal Engine 4 and Unity which are the most popular engines available at this point in time.<br /><br />Rate the program on the merits of what it purported to do, not on the fact you neglected to read and compare the features between LT and the full version before your purchase.\n",

I only got 7 months. 2:13 PM Gerald Mucci: No I do not need to BUY another. 2:13 PM Varun: Please give me a moment while I check your account. 2:15 PM Gerald Mucci: If you look at one of the open windows you will see my amazon account that says what I bought and when. 2:16 PM Gerald Mucci: Do you have any doubt that I bought this program in September through Amazon for a 1 year program and it is not accessible anymore? 2:19 PM Varun: It seems that you have purchased the product on 24/5/2015 and your product expired today. 2:20 PM Gerald Mucci: What does 24/5/2015 mean? 2:20 PM Varun: The date product was purchased 2:21 PM Gerald Mucci: 24 is what? 5 is what, May? We are only at May 1 2:22 PM Gerald Mucci: What date is it where you are? 2:25 PM Gerald Mucci: I bougth AVG 2014, and that is the only version I expect to have access to. 2:26 PM Varun: I'm sorry it has expired on 30/4/2015 2:27 PM Gerald Mucci: I am too. You need to make it expire on September 5, 2015. 2:28 PM Varun: 24/4/2014 to 30/4/2015 2:28 PM Varun: So it has already exoired. 2:29 PM Gerald Mucci: I purchased it on September 5, 2014. It should not expire unitl September 5, 2015. That is the one year I paid for. 2:31 PM Varun: I'm sorry gerald, it shows in the AVG database that the license number you provided has already wxpired. It might be a different License number. 2:32 PM Gerald Mucci: All I' am seeking is to get what I paid for. Do whatever you need to do to make the thing work till nect Sept 5. 2:33 PM Gerald Mucci: If you cannot make it work, put a supervisor on this chat. 2:37 PM Varun: I'm sorry Gerald it seems that the product is expired and there is no way it can be activated again as it has already lost its one year. 2:38 PM Gerald Mucci: Please put a supervisor on this chat. 2:38 PM Gerald Mucci: It has not expired because I paid for a year and only got less than 7months. 2:39 PM Gerald Mucci: I hate being screwed by a large company. 2:40 PM Varun: I'm sorry Gerald, I have referred the case with my supervisor and it seems that the product is expired. 2:40 PM Gerald Mucci: The product has not expired. Let me chat with the supervisor. Or if that supervisor does not want to be helpful let me chat with one above.. This is customer service at its very worst. 2:42 PM Varun: I'm sorry Gerald,we are unable to help you with the Issue as we can see from our end that the product has been expired and we are unableto Install the product in your computer. 2:42 PM Gerald Mucci: I have all the time in the world at this end. I have all the documentation that I paid for 1 year and only got 7 moths and discover that AVG will not assit. Amazon has excellent customer comments secition and I promise this will be widespread. 2:43 PM Gerald Mucci: Why will you not look at my purchase documentation and acknowledge that one year is what I paid for and that your system may be in error? 2:44 PM Gerald Mucci: Let me chat with your supervisor. 2:44 PM Gerald Mucci: Did you even look at my purchase documentation? 2:44 PM Varun: As I said before as far as the license number you have given it shows that it has been expired. 2:44 PM Gerald Mucci: Is that not relevant to you? 2:46 PM Gerald Mucci: Why can't someone help restore the product since my documentation clearly shows what I bought? Your system may be in error. 2:46 PM Gerald Mucci: Please put a supervisor on to chat with me. 2:46 PM Gerald Mucci: You are NOt instilling any confidence in AVG products or service. 2:47 PM Gerald Mucci: and what does this mean: 2:47 PM Gerald Mucci: And what does this mean: It seems that you have purchased the product on 24/5/2015 and your product expired today. 2:47 PM Gerald Mucci: That date is weeks in the future? 2:48 PM Gerald Mucci: Your system is dictating your poor customer service. 2:48 PM Gerald Mucci: I need to chat with a supervisor 2:48 PM Varun: I have typedit wrongly Gerald. Instead of 4 I have entered it as 5 2:48 PM Gerald Mucci: I noticed. I need to speak with a supervisor. 2:49 PM Gerald Mucci: I am way overdue for speaking with a supervisor. 2:49 PM Gerald Mucci: Have someone call me: 352-350-2624 in the US. 2:51 PM Varun: I'm sorry Gerald. We don't have an option to call you. I recommend to go to the following link to get phone support. 2:52 PM Varun: https://support.avg.com/support_sales?l=en_US  That support didn't help, either. Dead end with AVG all around.\n",

      "1\tI purchased a lifetime premium anti-malware program from Amazon.  Interesting software that get pretty decent reviews.  It installed fine and found some minor issues, and appeared to fix them.  I haven't purchased another copy for the wife's computer yet and  its probably a good thing I haven't.  It seems so far with each update you have to manually re-download the software and re install it or you get the need to log in as an administrator (and yes I am an administrator on my own computer).  You then get the privilege of spending a evening finding and following the many suggestions to remedy this issue.  Even better as I was writing this I saw someone asked where do you download the premium anti-malware program as only the free version is available to download and of course if you click the premium link it asks for a visa and would gladly take another $25 bucks from you.  This persons post was quickly responded to as um there is only 1 version - when you enter your serial number it will convert itself to the premium version.  The best part for me was the top most sticky note in their forums was a list of several fixes you can try to fix this problem.<br /><br />Below is the actual sticky post on their fourms...Posted nearly a year ago and its still has not been addressed....<br /><br />Posted 02 June 2014 - 11:14 PM<br />This is intended as suggested how-tos for curing those particular few cases with this specific issue when upgrading from an older Anti-Malware program version to the new one.<br /><br />A couple of sample screenshots of the message when the issue happens are attached below.<br /><br />Just some starter suggestions:<br /><br />First suggestion:  If you have already an installed version of the Anti-Malware, please be sure to have OFF the self-protection setting.<br />In version 2, click Settings icon &#62;&#62; then click Advanced Settings button.<br />There un-check the Enable self-protection module.  Then close the window.  Then jump down and startwith step A below.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I think the fact they even addressed it in a sticky post is great.  Their customers should be smart enough and have enough free time to research how to patch the software they have purchased what do consumers expect nowadays?<br /><br />maybe its time to get ride of the sticky post and fix the issue....or hire someone who can....\n",

This H&R product was slicker and easier to use than TurboTax, came with all the basic forms including Schedule C, imported last year's TurboTax file, and offered free electronic filing for 5 Federal returns. I did not purchase the state version since my state has a very usable website. Due to all the bad publicity, TurboTax offered registered users a $25 rebate. Too little, too late since the software cost $75. Good going H&R Block for offering a superior product for under $20.\n",

So first of all, I would like to let you know that you need to download the 30 Free Trial version in order to use an online key like this if you do not already have a previous subscription with McAfee. After downloading that you will need to go to this web address: www.mcafee.com/mtp/retailcard. This is the website you will be entering your code key into. After successfully doing this you will go down to you taskbar and find the McAfee icon in the bottom right corner, you will right click the icon and select &#34;Verify Subscribtion.&#34; A verification pop up will appear after a few seconds. After that I would double check the date your subscription expires by opening your McAfee Total Protection. Hope you all have an easier time than I did! Good Luck!

The next day (after getting external help and seemingly taking care of installation and data conversion issues), on starting the program, it came up with a comment stating that an upgrade was available, and if I wanted it installed. On agreeing to install it, the program went crazy and deleted my active data file completely. I had to call the external service guys who again, fixed the several inconsistencies.

      "1\tAfter calling the AVAST  support line, I was duped into purchasing a &#34;Total Support Package&#34; for $179.00  I called because I had a subscription to Premier and suddenly my system reverted to the free version when it was &#34;upgrading&#34; Avast. I wanted the premier version that I had paid for back on my computer. Instead of simply telling me what I needed to do, the guy said he had to log into my computer to “investigate” the problem.  He then showed me an event screen and showed me something that supposedly indicated that the security of my computer was “SEVERELY COMPROMISED” and that could only be fixed  by purchasing the &#34;Total Support System&#34; for 179$.<br /><br />He  pointed to &#34;windows upgrade failures&#34; saying these would cause horrid security issues and that this could only be fixed by purchasing total support.  -- When I looked at the Windows upgrade history later, I could see that the upgrades that had initially failed were later successfully upgraded (weeks ago)and long before my call to “Total Support.”  In other words, I realized I had been duped-- windows upgrades that he was telling me had failed to install had actually installed correctly the next attempt and were therefore not causing the so called security problems the guy claimed --In other words, I did not see the later successful upgrades while the guy was fast talking me on the phone frightening me into purchasing &#34;Total Support&#34;....<br /><br />Afterwards I realized that I’d been scammed into thinking my computer was “SEVERELY COMPROMISED,” using techniques described in this article:<br />http://www.sitepronews.com/2015/03/13/bogus-tech-support-companies-targeted-ftc/<br /><br />I was frightened and agreed to purchase the so called &#34;Total Support&#34;.  The technician then came on to my computer and reinstalled the premier and then ran a junkware clean-up program (no surprise quite a bit of junk was found) and did a quick AVAST virus scan andreinstalled the AVAST premier.  NOTHING appears to have changed, other than I have the premier avast that I had paid for .  The computer does not boot faster as was claimed would be a result of the services I received.  The computer does not run any faster or differently.<br />When I called “Total Support” to try to cancel the support contract I had a horrid experience.  Anyone who answered the phone had “supervisory authority” and initially refused to give me any refund.  No one would acknowledge the type of deceptive sales practices used.  I finally got them to give me a refund for the $179. Annual support contract but they insisted that I pay $119 because a technician had worked on my computer and found-- junkware.  Seriously, what computer does not harbor some junkware!  Honestly, if someone had just told me what to do to reinstall AVAST premier, my initial question, I could have done it myself. I am quite capable of running a junkware clean-up program.<br /><br />On AVAST’s main page, it says that AVAST offers free support???<br /><br />I read online that numerous people had trouble getting “Total Support” to remove credit charges after they claimed they would, so I called my credit card company to contest the charge for annual contract in the event that it was not removed.  The representative from the credit card company told me they had numerous complaints about the company and he suggested that I also contest the $119 dollar charge although that had not been my initial intent.<br /><br />I would like a refund of $119.00 for support that I was duped into purchasing.  But given everything I've read about this support company's tactics, seems unlikely...  numerous complaints like mine all over the web..<br />  I have used AVAST for years, and had been very satisfied.  At this point, I am disappointed and disgusted by your support services and don’t plan to renew.  I will purchase other anti-virus services.<br /><br />Read about AVASTs technicalsupport here  http://www.pcantivirusreviews.com/Reviews/avast/Internet-Security-Software/  and see how tech support compares with other antivirus programs here<br />http://www.pcantivirusreviews.com/Comparison/  where AVAST tech support is rated &#34;Poor&#34; compared to others\n",

You can only convert videos that you may take from your camera or other non copy protected DVDs.  If you purchased a DVD movie for your personal use, it's most likely &#34;copy protected&#34; and your movie cannot be converted even though its for your personal use.<br /><br />Very misleading marketing on their website (screen shot attached) and as Amazon does not allow you to return downloaded software, even though the can invalidate the product key and make the software non-functional, if you're stuck with something that you most likely will never use.\n",

After some early frustration trying to figure out how to use it (hint: it can be complicated) I am really happy with this software and still use it to this day. Not happy with all the attempted updates for all kinds of stuff from Adobe, but this product does the job intended.\n",
      "5\tAlways well done.  Highly recommended\n",
      "5\tExcellent product. After the turbo tax fiasco, I went to H&R block software, cheaper just as easy to use.\n",
      "5\tI found it to be very user friendly.  There was a slight glitch in downloading the music into another venue, but overall I was pleased with the results.\n",
      "5\tGreat product at a great price (at the time), however after the license was completed, they wanted to charge me almost $90 to renew.\n",

      "1\tBUYER BEWARE: Even though the descriptions indicate the subscription allows you to pay one employee with no additional charge, Intuit WILL charge you if you date a payroll payment in a prior month.  For example, if you sit down and enter a payment on the first of the month and date it the prior day (last day of the month) they WILL charge you!<br /><br />I have been a very loyal Intuit customer for over 20 years (Quicken, Quickbooks, TurboTax Personal, TurboTax Business).  This kind of scamming will make me find an alternative.\n",
      "1\tIf you liked the older versions. You may hate this one.  The biggest disappoint for me was the reporting features are not the same as the older ones.  Completely new reports without the full control you had with the older ones.  I much prefer the older versions they changed the new one way to much!\n",
      "5\tGreat Service, I use this all the time in school to let my friends use the schools internet without getting blocked. Since the school only blocks phones and not laptops, I can let everyone else use the wifi via a personal HotSpot! Works like a charm and is worth the upgrade! Don't be fooled by the bad comments, instead look at the good advantages from this! Go to connectify.me to get the subscription!\n",

      "4\tWorked as I expected. Don't go changing the tools w/o user input. Almost used competitor this year, but this came at reasonable price late in tac season.\n",
      "3\tReview of the taxes is not efficient.  If there is a mistake, it does not take you to the location to fix it, it only tells you there is a mistake and then it is up to you to fix it, if you know how to.\n",

      "4\tEveryone had to upgrade in order for payroll to still work, so we chose to go with 2014 rather than 2015.  I use 2015 in another business and like 2014 better.\n",
      "5\tI have been using Turbo Tax every year for the last ten or eleven years.  In my opinion it gets better every year.  Simple format that asks questions to ensure you are getting your maximum deductions.  I did get confused by the version name changes this year.  But the product descriptions quickly helped me pick the correct version for my needs.  I am able to complete my complicated return in less than two hours with complete confidence in the final results.  Emailing the return makes it so much easier.  I hate tax season but Turbo Tax makes it so much more tolerable knowing I don't have to pour over a bunch of complicated forms.  Does my state taxes in about 15-minutes.  I will never use another program and the price was unbelievable compared to brick and mortar stores - even Costco and Sam's Club where I usually buy mine.  Couldn't be more pleased.\n",
      "4\tI find it slightly less intuitive than TurboTax, but it is a much better value than TurboTax. Specifically, you don't have to pay as much for the various forms for small businesses.\n",

It updates on its own so you don't have to worry about always being out-of-date.  If you are looking for an anti-virus program and you are strapped for cash this is the one I would use.\n",

      "2\tUsed Quicken for 20 plus years.  I thought 2013 was a bit buggy so I went back to 2012.  Of course his year I can no longer download (as of April 30) data.  So I purchase Q2015 from Amazon.  It is DOUBTFUL that I have ever used a buggier program.  Mobile app sync crashed and corrupted my desktop data twice,. Thus, I told Quicken to stop using it.  Now that I seem to have the desktop top working (almost exactly like 2013). I decided to give the mobile app one more try.  Unable to get it to even though it says synced successfully.  If one choose to use this program (like I will for a bit longer) back up often,  The program still periodically locks up and sometimes corrupts the data.<br />I plan o try over the next few weeks to give Moneydance a shot concurrently with Quicken.  BTW PC Version Q2015 using Windows 7 OS\n",

      "2\tForced upgrade from 2012 to 2015 version due to non-support of simple online functions such as downloading transactions from bank accounts. None of the new features were needed (2012 version worked just fine) and the cosmetic changes and tweaks to the user interface over the last several versions (2013-15) only made things worse with extra clicks to accomplish the same tasks, confusing screen layouts and decreased functionality. Was a pure down-grade in our opinion.\n",

      "5\tI just love the program .... Down load went okay. I am overwhelmed with the magic wand and how it helps to clean up unwanted things in your picture. Actually if I don't use anything else from this program I have gotten my moneys worth. Now if you can come up with the same easy application for fixing my blurred pictures I would totally be in heaven. THANK YOU\n",

      "1\tThe tech support is horrible, only exceeded by Adobe's paranoia that makes you sign into apps that ought to just run.  In my case:<br /><br />1. The installation was not compatible with my IE 11 ,, giving error message.  I called in and without my permission Adobe trashed mi IE installation throwing away valuable settings and passwords.  This took me two hours to restore.<br /><br />2. The installation &#34;ugraded&#34; my Acrobat PRO to the &#34;DC&#34; version .....to THE TRIAL VERSION.  Now I can no longer use Acrobat at all since I had a lot of customization that has been thrown away!\n",

Works as intended.  Can be used for small mind maps, if reference and resource linking is not required.<br /><br />Pros<br /> • Simplistic.<br /> • Easy to use.<br /> • Auto Save option.<br /> • Insert images. (Can be used as nodes.)<br /> • Insert floating text for notes (Limited formatting).<br /> • Cut & paste text only (From web pages or any text document).<br /><br />Cons<br /> • No spell check.<br /> • No drag & drop.<br /> • No linking to files or folders.<br /> • No web links.\n",

      "1\tDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have been using it since Feb 2015 . . when I was told in order to continue to use the 'online banking updates' that Q/Mac/2015 would be required to download transactions. Since then my product had had 5 'episodes' on non-connection with SunTrust Bank.  There is NO one at Intuit that will even admit there is a problem, although on their 'website forums' there are at least 15 people with the same 'error message' problem.  I have spent 4 hours on the phone, 7 'online chat sessions' of over an hour each, and tried every suggestion that they make. NOTHING WORKS and all Intuit will say is 'we are sorry for the inconvenience'.\n",
      "4\tThe new user interface is more streamlined, and easier to view. I'm glad  there is now an Android app so that I can view my finances on the go. It does not appear buggy at all, which is big - this release was well vetted.\n",
      "1\tI bought the new version of Companionlink for syncing MS Outlook for Mac with Google Calendar.  If it worked it would allowed me to sync calendars between my Google calendar on Samsung Android and MS Outlook for Mac - a key functionality missing from the marketplace for quite some time.  However this product clearly has not been thoroughly tested - and at this point I'm giving up and asking for my money back.  I've worked with their tech support over the last few months on a half dozen major issues since I first installed, spent many hours capturing and sending logs, describing the various problems, downloading yet another beta version to try out, discovering yet another set of problems with that one etc. etc.  Clearly they do not have a handle on their development process.  As an IT guy for 30 years I can recognize a development shop in shambles - and this is one.  They probably don't have enough money to pay for adequate testing.  So I would definitely stay away from this high maintenance product.\n",
      "1\tI hate to write a bad review, but something has got to give.<br /><br />Quicken will not update from bank.  For me, it is all manual.  I upgraded because Quicken customer service said that upgrading was the only solution.  No, it is not a solution because it still doesn't work.<br /><br />The customer service is awful.  When a problem can't be solved, the connection is suddenly broken.  Plus, they are mean!  Both of my banks have washed their hands of it and will not help with Quicken problems!  Why do I have it?  It seems like the only game in town.\n",

Did and uninstall and then a new download.  Have never been able to get the install to work.  Have gone thru 3 or more pages of installation instructions, still without any luck.  Can you please send me a disc, so that I can get this Quicken 15 deluxe properly installed.  Thanks\n",
